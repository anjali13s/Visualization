Upon reaching, the check-in process was smooth and fuss-free with staff readily available on hand to attend to any requests. Mr Justin Phua, who facilitated our check-in, offered a complimentary Fullerton Bear as a birthday gift and also assisted us with our request on late check-out which was amazing! We had much more time to enjoy the beautiful room and facilities like the swimming pool.   Mr Andrew also assisted us on our special request on the room, much to our delight! The in-house catering team, including Ms Ling, who attended to us, was amazing and attentive to our orders. The warmth and hospitality that Fullerton radiates is something special for all guests who wish to consider a stay here.   We will definitely return in future! Thank you to all the staff at Fullerton Hotel!…\n",
      "<q class=\"IRsGHoPm\"><span>So, I've looked up the reviews before choosing to go with Fullerton this time for a friend's birthday celebration. However, I was disappointed and would not return again. Here's why: 1. Prearrival - received email 5 days in advance to fill out a form. Filled out the form and responded to the email to inquire hi-tea and cocktail timing as I will be celebrating my friend's birthday and need to do some planning. Was forwarded to the straits club mgr to answer the hi-tea and cocktail timing, only.  2. Arrival - ID with date of birth was given upon check in but also no recognition.  3. Room is old, facing the insides of the hotel with minimum amenities. Understand it's COVID and you trying to go green but not sure if that is luxury - when you need the guest to call and request for</span><span class=\"_1M-1YYJt\"> basic amenities (e.g. Comb, cotton bud, etc.) Later on when we asked for the cotton buds, then we realised that it comes with the vanity kit (with cotton pad and nail file) which means, the vanity kit in the room when we checked-in (missing cotton buds) are left from the previous guest? 4.  Food served at hi-tea and cocktail was meh. Not worth going for seconds.  5. Chandon breakfast - Again, not recognised or asked if we would like Chandon. Only when asked and after checking, then was there Chandon served. Saving grace was that the breakfast spread is actually tasty but not enough to get me back again. We don't expect complimentary gifts or cake but guest recognition is clearly non-existent in Fullerton.</span><span>…</span></q>\n",
