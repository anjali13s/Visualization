However, do note we visited sometime ago.Nonetheless. For SGD 76 (for 2 pax), you’ll get a lovely 3 tiered selection of both sweet and savouries brought together with an explosion of flavours consisting of treats such as Shaved Virginia Ham Sandwich with Truffle Mayonnaise, Strawberry Pistachio Choux, Dark Chocolate Pear Caramel and Coffee Caramel Roulade with a portion of scones served with butter, cream and jam. All in all quite a nice experience and our ideal way to pass an afternoon. Service was lovely with the servers being dears.

13,5.0,"Back to Pan Pacific Singapore after seeing some photos on the newly renovated Pacific Harbour Studio. Trust me, if you're into large spaces and large tubs, this is for you! PPSG is no stranger in my group of friends. No doubt I like spending time here, but every time is always something new or memorable. The studio suite, is even better in person (although I kinda hope the view will be full view instead of 90 degrees view of the Marina Bay only.) If you have stay in PPSG before, you'll recognize the warm hospitality, the comfort in your room and the quality of the amenities. This time no change, but extra friendly services from Jayrick. Kudos to him for all the arrangements. The suite includes a big tub (which take a long time to fill, ensure you fill it in advance to use). Bose surround speakers for your TV in living area, I feel the bed are nicer too in the suite. State of the art toto toilet, bigger shower area. I'd say, all is well done in this category wof rooms at PPSG. All Pacific category comes with club benefits which includes afternoon tea, evening cocktails + canapes, and champagne breakfast. Although the food quality isn't top notch (I'm fussy), the boozes are good! I'll recommend this category of room for anniversary, intimate celebrations. Well done again Pan Pacific Singapore :)",Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel,4.5

16,5.0,"Had a very pleasant anniversary stay with pan pacific. It was a seamless experience arranging for the deco before our check in. I was promptly attended by Ayaka when I enquired about arranging deco. We then communicated via whatsapp on the follow ups. I came to the hotel the night before and was pleasantly greeted by Thiagu, I passed him the flowers to safekeep in the fridge.On check in day, I liaised with Ayaka on receiving the balloons and flower petal. She was very proactive in handling my requests. The set up she did for us was impeccable! Ayaka met us during check in and she was so kind and pleasant. We were sitting initially and we she came, we wanted to stand but she insisted that we remain seated. While I was signing the papers, she chatted with us to avoid any awkward silence, that was very thoughtful of her!We checked into the Harbour Studio room - spotless and very clean. The view of the marina bay area is amazing! Also, the deco was nicely done. Very detailed petal arrangement. The shower gel smells great. The pillows were too soft though, we had to ask for multiple pillows to make up for the softness haha. At night, We ordered truffle fries through the app. We received the food after 35mins or so. Not so nice, very faint taste of truffle. We made booking of our breakfast session through the QR code too. It was very convenient for younger people like us. At breakfast Danial brought us to our seats and guide through the ordering method. The breakfast was nice but not as extensive as it used to be. There is a selection of eggs, asian food and pancake/waffles. We were advised to use the express check out. No que, very easy. We approached Concierge TJ and Nassier who was very cheerful and forthcoming to collect carpark coupon. No frill collection and it was a nice way to end to summarize the whole say with their bright smiles TJ's elated tone. Cheers to all who made our stay a very pleasant one!!",Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel,4.5

We were greeted by friendly front desk manager, Abhi, who professionally assisted us in checking in, and tried his best to accommodate to our various requests and enquiries.

However, due to a miscommunication, there was a slight unhappiness which was quickly resolved by the manager, Vincent, who addressed our concerns in a prompt and caring manner.In short, we were really impressed by the quality of customer service in this hotel where guests are treated with respect and you could tell the staff goes out of their way to make guests feel welcome and be at home.

39,5.0,"My husband and I had the most amazing 8-course private dining experience at the Keyaki Restaurant's private tatami room for his birthday celebration! Overlooking a little garden, the tatami room was a beautiful place full of serenity. Soft calming music played in the background and a coat hanger was available. The tatami floor and seats were absolutely gorgeous. We booked the entire space to ourselves, and for the whole 3.5-hours, we were served by the Japanese restaurant manager who was exceptional - very polite, detail-oriented and thoughtful. We truly felt like we had been transported to Japan! The manager and chefs went above and well beyond my expectations in helping me prepare for this celebration. To book the tatami private dining room, a minimum spend of $700 on total is required. However, since I was booking the room for two people only (my husband and me), this was a problem as the most expensive course dinner was $200 per pax, which meant that we had to sit for a whopping 16-course dinner per person to meet the minimum spend. When I called the restaurant to share my concern, the manager was incredibly kind and proactive in offering solutions. The manager discussed with the chefs who later proposed a curated $250/pax bespoke menu for my husband and me (see attached), and allowed us to have a minimum spend of $500 in total for the evening.The food was heavenly! Every course was perfectly designed, cooked and plated. Each course took us on an incredible gastronomical journey through Japanese cuisine. The ingredients used were of the highest quality! I especially enjoyed the starters, lobster and wagyu dishes.  In addition to the 8-course dinner, the restaurant prepared a red velvet birthday cake too. Even that tasted so good! One of the courses was a claypot rice. The restaurant manger presented the claypot to us to show us how the rice was cooked in it, before portioning the dish into two - this was such classy quality service, where even the smallest of details received utmost attention to ensure that we had the best experience possible. The component of each dish was explained to us in detail which truly made us savour each bite.I would highly recommend the private tatami dining room for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in Japanese food and ambience. The food and service was spectacular, and I would definitely be back for more!",Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel,4.5

43,5.0,"Stayed at the pacific harbour studio with club access and it was AMAZING. We had a celebratory occasion going on and the staff did something special for us with balloons which was very much appreciated! The room was clean and spacious so highly recommended. The club access brings you stunning view of the city.. the food spread was not as sumptuous as pre-covid times but I must say it is pretty decent. If there is one reason I'd return to the club lounge, it would be to enjoy the conversation and service of your staff Evan and the crew serving at the club access floor. Evan has been a warm ray of sunlight (even at dusk) who has been wonderfully attentive to my partner and my needs, and charmingly personable to make us feel comfortable. Her knowledge of the cocktails was so spectacular that I definitely ended up drinking more than I had initially expected. ""Hit the spot"". I don't often drink cocktails because most places tend to water them down (or scrimp on the alcohol), but McLuther at Pan Pacific nailed the cocktails perfectly. Not overly sweet or syrupy, yet every glass was a worldly blend of taste, smell, and colour. Special props to the Pep Berry and Whiskey Sour - berrilicious Pep Berry was an exquisite balance of fizz and sweet, while the Whiskey Sour ignited an explosion of delight. One more glass please!Orchestrating the team together was Shine the manager at the club access level who was very customer oriented and delighting us with every interaction.

The lift was facing outside rather than inside which was nice.- Sufficient amount of power plugs, a lot of switches to control different lighting.- Sheltered walkway to marina square and suntec city.The bad:- Equipment may be slightly dated, receiver for the blind is spoiled, had to get 2 engineers around 1 hr to fix it.- Some lighting were flashing, issue was temporary gone when the engineers was fixing the blind but came back afterwards.- There were some stains on the bathroom floor, which was cleared by the staff which came to attend the all the issues above after a call to reception.- Borrowed HDMI, but did not manage to connect to the TV, not sure if is the wire or connection issue.- A lot of side entrance are closed due to covid19, hence might not be easy on the first try to successfully reach the hotel without using main entrance, was walking throught the back alley.

I am heartened to see members of your staff taking the initiative to direct some of the guests to the three counters on the left (Departure, ?Redemption) which certainly expedited the check-in process. We would like to commend Ms. Jane, who was very polite and helpful, and ensured a smooth check-in process.We would like to laud Ms. Sammi for her soft-spoken and corteous demeanour. Ms. Sammi was very patient with our enquiries when explained thoroughly to us the differences between the room charges and upgrading fees.The next morning, at Edge Restaurant, waitress Ms. Zainab was also very hospitable and engaged with us with light conversations during our breakfast. Ordering the food on the app was easy and quick, and the food was very promptly sent to our tables within minutes.  Aside from the delicious breakfast spread, the service at Edge Restaurant was good and efficient.Room Service to Room 2727 was also very prompt, when we called ServiceOne to request for an additional pillow and blanket.However, we would also like to bring your attention to some faulty room amenities in Room 1311. Firstly, we would like to highlight the broken handle of the clothes iron. Secondly, the ironing board was wobbly and collapsed during utilisation. We also encountered some confusion with the minibars with its auto-lock mechanism, which resulted to us calling ServiceOne for assistance. All in all, we are amazed at the overall efficiency and service that the Pan Pacific Singapore team has rendered to my family and I.

90,1.0,"We understood that it was the holidays and the hotel was packed. We booked a breakfast slot upon check in for next day’s breakfast. As we turned up at breakfast, we were ushered to the lobby view. We placed our orders and was curious as the drinks were not in the menu. We asked about the choices that the restaurant offer. From then on, after placing our orders, we were treated invisible, not even our attempt to raise or wave our hands could capture anyone’s attention to get some dark soya sauce for my soft-boiled egg. The nasi lemak’s rice was as though it was not cooked at all. Janice also saw us seeking assistance but decided to speak with her 2 other indian gentlemen in suits. After waiting for 15 minutes of no availability of assistance, we called the hotel main line to request to speak to the duty manager, Sam Foo. He came to the restaurant, also having a hard time to locate us in the restaurant. We shared our indifferent treatment by the restaurant to him. He was apologetic and asked what he could do to offer a service recovery.Even after speaking to him, one of our orders - scrambled egg was not even on the table. It took about 50 mins for that! He told us to give him a call after our breakfast. I tried to order another round of soft-boiled egg set this time round as the previous round was cold since no one turned up to get me my dark soya sauce. Apparently my order got through the system, with a confirmation of my order reflected in the system. I waited for about 15 minutes but I saw people leaving the restaurant gradually. I was puzzled and tried to signal to Mr Mani. He explained that last order was at 10.15am. I was flabbergasted, no one came around to inform us! He offered to expedite my order, to which he only came with the eggs, without the toast, as though unhappy with my late order.We left the restaurant, really unhappy and upset. Mr Sam called us when we returned to our room. He extended lunch at the Chinese restaurant. We declined the lunch offer as we were really disappointed with the service by then.

95,3.0,"For the price I paid for the family package, I don't think it was very worth it. Kids' activities were only happening on the weekends. Given that it's school holidays, they should have more kids activities even on weekdays. The worse experience was at breakfast. I felt like I was eating in the canteen. Food choices were very limited, pale in comparison to pre-covid days. There were other hotels who could offer better menu even in covid times. We were rushed to finish our breakfast within a certain time, food cannot be customised. They were all prepared beforehand and thrown onto your table.

A big thank YOU to Roxanne Caluza for personally attending to my reservation and ensuring everything was in order by the time I checked in. Got a room at level 11. Wished I had a room at a higher floor but I understood that it was not possible due to an ongoing event.Had some issues at first on the first day when our room was not turned down at 8 pm despite 8 pm being the agreed time but eventually that was sorted out & since then, the housekeeping dept did a fantastic job of ensuring that our room was kept clean and tidy twice a day (daily housekeeping at 10 am & turn down service at 8 pm).We had an issue with the bathroom door too on the first day. The maintenance personnel came and said he would need some time to look into it. It took a little bit of reminders to the Duty Manager but eventually the issue was resolved the next day.Very friendly concierge dept too. As I drove to work daily from the hotel, I had plenty of opportunity to interact with the concierge & guest relations services dept. Big thanks to TJ for his ever-so friendly personality & always making me & my sister laugh! And not forgetting those who had attended to me like Ismail, Abdul, Kuselan .. truly friendly & really made me feel at home!Despite the initial issues, the hotel personnel did step up to improve on their services & since then, they truly have made my sister and I feel really at home.We’ll return, for sure!",Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel,4.5
97,4.0,"Stayed here more than 15 years ago and during this re-visit, the first impression of the lobby was that it was somehow “off-focus”, probably due to the domes of Atrium at the background, giving it a clustered feeling within the same area and doesn’t give you the grand feeling of an open field like the Shang Orchard. The lobby also could do with more sofa to provide some “focus” and also for the guests families members to take a seat while one of them is checking in. Despite 8-9 counters functioning, the check-in still took half an hour at an off-peak 1pm timing but hey, this was the school holidays in a staycation craze year so I was in a way lucky when they informed me to check in at a 1pm timing. The front desk manager who was manning the queue, could probably do with a bit more smile and eye contact since this is the hospitality industry. In general, PanPac gives the feeling of a business hotel rather than a family one, ie professional but cold.Room was relatively clean but aged and in need of a revamp. TV channels appeared lesser than most hotels but it has a folio function which allows its guest to track the charges billed to the room, which was useful in my case. Toiletries were of a reasonable quality and the room on an overall, while aged, serves its purpose in providing a comfortable short stay. Anything longer you may wish to consider another hotel.Keyaki and Hai Tien Lou food were nice as usual and they are not included in this hotel ranking since they are considered independently run.The swimming pool was very crowded during the half hr interval between each time slots due to some guests from the previous time slots not leaving despite exceeding their permitted timings. We have witnessed this twice and PanPac has to do something to resolve this issue. The front desk was kind to extend the check out till 2pm after hearing that we only managed to get the 11.30-1pm pool slot and it is due to their hospitable gesture that I gave them an additional star in the rating.Have paid $90 for the breakfast for 2 adults at the Edge and it was definitely not worth the money. Due to the pandemic, the timings for breakfast have to be booked and we could only secure the remaining 7-8am slot but this is perfectly fine since it is necessary to have social distancing. However, despite only having 4-5 tables before 7.30am, there was still a missed order. We ordered an overeasy eggs set at 7.18am but it only arrived 50mins later.What happened was that our order was missed out but it is not the omittance that resulted in my displeasure, rather it is the nonchalant attitude of the restaurant manager. The following was the chronology of what has happened.- 7.18am: Order placed via the system.- 7.48am (half an hour after the order was placed): We informed one of the restaurant managers, to check our order if it was missed out.- 7.55am: He was bringing in other customers to their tables and did not update us on the outcome of his checking. We have to remind him again and apparently he has not done anything.- 7.58am: He came back to inform us that the order was still in queue and that the chef is still preparing. I in turn replied that when I first made the order at 7.18am, there were only 4-5 tables around and thus, how could the order still be in queue? I have told him that if it was a missed order, they should have upfront admitted it, instead of trying to side track their customers. Upon being pointed out, he reluctantly apologised for the missed order, which you could feel his insincerity. He said that he has asked the chef to expedite the order.- 8.08am: I flagged for another manager as it has been 50mins waiting for the overeasy eggs. Upon hearing it, the manager came back with the eggs in one minute. This second manager has shown the hotel hospitality spirit to resolve the issue and move forward. Conversely the first manager should either adopt this or change his job to another industry.Will I come back to PanPac again? Maybe but there are better choices out there.",Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel,4.5

17,5.0,"Booked this hotel from Klook to have a staycation with my friend for my birthday. It started with Anna from reservations, she is one of the most meticulous staff from reservations that I've encountered. I emailed to check with the hotel if I could get an early check-in and late check-out for my stay as I'd like to use the hotel facilities. She told me that although requests are upon availability, she assured me that she'd put up my requests. Also she asked if I was celebrating anything, and when I mentioned my birthday, she also noted it down in my booking. Lastly, she checked with me if I had any room preferences (which I didn't). I mean, she's really meticulous!Upon my arrival on the day, I arrived at 11.30am after I checking-out from another hotel, and headed to PHCQ, we were swiftly checked-in by Angeline. Angeline (from FO) was amazing! She saw the requests in the reservation, gave us a room upgrade, and one with a river view. She even extended a late check-out to us, and to prevent us from getting locked out from out room, she helped us to reprogram our room keys.Certain issues that I've encountered like not being able to call to operator or housekeeping (the phone just kept ringing) to request for ice and extra pillow, I went down to front desk and Angeline immediately got other staff to send the items.The gym was quite well sized, and they have a fairly simple booking system to book for breakfast, and facilities usage.Thank you PHCQ team, I had a comfortable and enjoyable birthday and stay here!","Park Hotel Clarke Quay, Singapore",4.0

Post some initial due diligence and also after going through reviews online, we zeroed in on Park Hotel Clark Quay.

79,3.0,"The stay we had was enjoyable. The rooms were generally clean, apart from some stains on the bedsheet and pillow cases. Not a big deal as a quick call for housekeeping resolved this issue rather quickly. The best part of this stay had to be the pool. It was huge (by hotel standards) and suitable for lap swimming. The pool area was also pretty. Loved those pillars around the pool. I think they are Roman inspired. Really contributes to the aesthetics of the place.However, not everything was perfect about the stay. The most glaring negative was the breakfast. Each guest was entitled to only one set. Absolutely no refills apart from drinks were allowed. This came as a surprise to me. There wasn’t even a break basket, fruit or yoghurt. The egg set I had was miserable looking. To make it worse, they forgot the sausages (which were clearly stated in the menu). I had to request for them. All this combined to make the hotel seem cheap and penny pinching. I suppose with their reopening prices being so cheap, they decided to cut costs from the breakfast. Hopefully, with prices now edging back up they improve their breakfast offerings.

With covid-19 pandemic Park Hotel Clark Quay don't seem to realise how important it is to have one' backside to be washed clean than to just using soap. Of course the management can always reasoned that it can be done inside the shower but really??? How inconvenient and unhygienic to wash your filty backside inside a shower. BIGET is the most practical, convenient and hygienic way to wash your backside inside a toilet bowl before it being flushed. Simple common sense but yet never put it as the most important priority.

Adian was so helpful in helping me with my booking & enquiries, Kaylee was fast and efficient with the billing upon check out. Hafiz promptly assisted me and family with our bags upon check out as we still wanted to get some coffee and walk around for a bit. Vijay then assisted with our bags and sent us off in our Grab with us feeling bittersweet - happy that the stay was great but sad that our dreamy staycation had ended. The room was spacious, with a great view overlooking the pool and the calming sound of the waterfall next to our room. Perfect for having a night cup of coffee in the balcony with such a great ambience. A huge huge thank you for the birthday cake, personalised birthday card and the call made to the room to wish us personally.This hotel has got to be the best place I have had a staycation at and I am more than positive that we will be back again. Thank you for the stay, Shangri La! It was a pleasure.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
5,4.0,"Went for a staycay in Nov 2020 on a family package. The hotel is huge and grand, and crowded as it was the school holiday period. They couldn't give us a room so they gave us 2 complimentary drinks. However, to redeem that 2 drinks, we had to make booking for a table at the cafe, and sort of were ""hinted"" to vacate soon. Our room was at Garden Wing, with the balcony looking over the main road. Room was a bit aged, but it was fine. The lifts were always busy and crowded. Moving around the hotel was not too straight forward with a pram, such as going to the restaurant on the 2nd floor, or the breakfast next to the pool. The splash area was great for the kids, and the walk on the lawn was refreshing. Due to safe management measures, breakfast was ordered through the phone which kind of lacked the personal touch. When we went to the restaurant on the 2nd floor for lunch, the staff seemed to have forgotten about us and we were waiting at the foot of the staircase for quite a long while. There was also no lift access and they could have swapped a table for us at the 1st floor. When the place is crowded it gets really crowded, so you might want to take that into consideration. Else, it's a refreshing escape from the city.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

7,5.0,"Dear Shangri-La,  I would like to give my highest of compliments to your excellent team that took care of me during my stay on 16th February. It was a very special day for me as it was the day I proposed to my future wife. I am glad I made the right choice of choosing Shangri-La for my occasion. Firstly, I would like to personally thank Yana Arshad and her fantastic team from Guest Relation who went far beyond the extra mile to ensure that this day will be a perfect one for me. She arranged a romantic set-up during check-in for us to begin with a great start. She coordinated well with me to have our friends come and setup the surprise during dinner. To end it all, she pre-ordered a cake that came in just in time for us to celebrate this joyful day.   I would also like to thank a few of your staff such as Farah from check-in reception who greeted us with the warmest welcome and provided us with the corner room so we had more space for the set-up. Secondly, Afiq from The Line Restaurant who is a great host by ensuring the all our ordered food was right and was a great company for dinner. Finally, Arif from check-out reception who concluded our our stay with a big smile and making our stay at Shangri-La a full circle.   I want you to know that I sincerely appreciate the outstanding service Shangri-La has given me. I am really impressed with the warmth of your team, they have exceeded every expectations. I will definitely recommend your hotel to friends & family.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

We chose the Shangri La Becos it offered a quiet self contained sanctuary among the hustle and bustle of Orchard road - the rejuvenation was magical in a covid19 stricken environment . The facilities the ambience the Origin grill - were fantastic . And of course the great hospitality made our stay an unforgettable one .

The room was all done and decorated with flowers, cake, chocolates, fruits as we were celebrating a special occasion..Special mention of Jeghan from the valley wing summit for making us feel extra special and making super drinks for us. He surely is an asset! Also Ling Ling from the Line restaurant who took great care of our son and us during breakfast. Went out of the way to order stuff for us. She is truly a star ! The origin grill restaurant was fab and the gentleman there ordered a super customized dish for us. The buds is just simply awesome and my son loved it ! Great getaway within the city !! We will be back soon !","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
14,3.0,"Just completed a staycation at the Garden Wing. The only positive comments I have about the hotel is the  grand lobby, the generous size of the room and the lush greenery.Room was not ready when we checked in at 3.00. Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm.  Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in.  In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila.Room was a bit dated but that’s OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself. We only discovered the defect when we realised that the kettle had boiled itself dry! Poor QC? Could be a potential safety hazard.Compared to other 5 star hotels, bathroom amenities seem a bit miserly. Only bath and hand towels were provided. No face towel? Only 1 bath gel was provided. Had to trouble housekeeping for additional bath gels.Breakfast at the line was Ok. Extensive menu but quality was rather average.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

16,4.0,"I stayed here last Dec, and decided to return again this week for the same valley Indulgence package. It was overall a pleasant experience, though we noted a few changes. In the valley wing club room, they no longer had a buffet line, but rather a designated tea & canapes set. It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
17,5.0,"Our little family had a fantastic time. We stayed for 2 nights, had a late checkout until 7pm so we had 3 days. I was travelling with my 1 year old and 4 year old, and they had a wonderful time. Because of Covid, everything needs to be booked and our preferred times weren’t available, but we managed to work it out and get a good schedule. Buds was great (we’ve been there before as non guest), and the splash area that’s been refurbished recently was so much fun. The room was lovely (garden wing deluxe pool view), with a huge bath as well as a shower. We also ate at origins and the food was particularly fantastic, I love how they cater for both adults and kids with great food and good options. The mushroom soup was so good, and my steak was amazing too.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
18,5.0,"My wife and I just completed our stay at Shangri-La. This has been one of my most satisfying stay at a local hotel. I wanted to compliment both the hotel and the staff for the outstanding hospitality and warmth shown throughout our stay. In our interactions with lobby/lounge ambassadors and the dining staff, it was evident how the hotel goes to the length to ensure the safety and welfare of the staff. It had certainly contributed to the motivation and dedication of the staff. They feel appreciated and as such they provide the best in class service to us in turn. Especially the staff who come from overseas. They were so pleasant and bright throughout and never showed any sign of missing hone. Special bouquets to Edward, Jegan, Raja and Sharmila. These were the stalwarts of excellence in service at Vallley Wing. They provided an exquisite touch to Shangri-La’s hospitality. We were familiar with the wonderfully curated stay at Valley wing- from the afternoon tea to the lounge access and the Summit room breakfast. And we enjoyed the touch of class in all of these services offered to the guests. No regrets. But what made this stay much more special is the story of your staff and how Shangri-La has captured their hearts and minds of the staff. It is the positivity in all of them that created the atmosphere of positive vibes for guestsThanks to Shangri-La and thanks to the exemplary staff who were part of our fond memories.

20,1.0,"This is a long feedback to the staff of Shangri-la.My family stayed here for 3D2N over the weekend. The poor service started when we tried to book restaurant reservations for lunch and dinner over the 3 days. The hotel staff was adamant over the phone that all restaurants were fully booked despite us having $200 dining vouchers for use. However there were a lot of available slots when I personally went down to the restaurants.On the first night, I was able to book The Line restaurant and we proceeded to order ala carte. We then waited 1 hour for a simple spaghetti and meatball dish. When asked why it took so long, the waiter informed that a overseas flight landed so they had to prioritize SHN travelers. The reason did not make sense!After 1hr 15mins, we gave up, told them to pack the food while we ate at the next restaurant, Waterfalls. For the next 2 breakfasts at The Line again, the food and service was embarrassing. They cannot even get their soft boiled eggs correct. Even after repeated orders, all the eggs came back full boiled. Again, after 45mins of waiting for basic soft boiled eggs, we gave up and went to another restaurant and paid additional for breakfast.The rooms were very dated and dirty, the TV barely worked, room service was unsurprisingly slow.Even with the good amenities, the poor service and experience did not match the price paid.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
21,5.0,We stayed for my husband’s 40th birthday celebration and were really pleased that we were upgraded to the deluxe one bed suite. Everything was excellent during our stay. The children had so much fun with the Splash zone and Buds as well as the pool. Breakfast at the Line was also great with the usual choices of breakfast regulars. If I may suggest though to include the drinks I.e. coffee and juices in the online menu ordering system as in the third and last day of our stay we decided to eat outdoors instead and it took us sometime to be able to find someone to help us get our coffee and I had to go indoors after sometime and find another someone to request for the same coffee before it finally did arrived. I think there are more staff indoors than outdoors hence the delay. But probably if the drinks are included in the online menu then we don’t need to call someone to order it. Otherwise our stay was great and would really recommend it to my family and friends.,"Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

The Package comes with the below. $100 dining credit - Free 2 indoor BUDS playground for 2 Child- Free water playground SPLASH zone - Other kids friendly activities like baking & KOI Fish Feeding (although just piping cream, the kids enjoyed their cupcake with topping)- Free picnic basket as well Additional: - Free cake for Birthday celebration- Free Goodie bag small lego free x2 set for the kids to self entertain during the stay- 4 homemade small cookies pack for kids- Free 2 pack of cookies and free fruits in room..- Free upgrade of room as it is for birthday celebration I went to the counter early to check in, the check in is very systematic with 8 counters. Due to safe distancing, they have a queue but yet clearing very fast. I am addressed by very helpful receptionist and they are attentive to my questions and kids. That's where the kids received 2 goodie bag with Lego & cookies inside. The kids are overjoyed and sit quietly while waiting to check in. As this is my first time booking Shangri-la Staycation, i was also told that i require to make prior booking for BUDS & SPLASH Zone. While i was making booking and also exploring BUDS, i receive a call that the room is ready for early check in. That's efficient. I managed to get into the room by 12.30pm. I am very amazed with Shangri-la thoughtfulness. Inside the room, it comes with Self-care pack consist of masks, hand sanitizer, anti bacterial wipes. On Top of that, i still have kids slipper and kids toothbrush in the room. They have given me free extra bed & free baby cot too. (no additional charges) I have utilize the $100 Dining credits at Origin Grill. The food is awesome, the service is good, the ambience is lovely. 100/100! The food they are also accommodating enough with kids meal. i would like to compliment esp on the service as my son is quite cranky over dinner time making noise and demanding. The staff is patient and helpful.  I have the breakfast at the Line. Was abit disappointed with the ala carte style but i do understand is due to covid. The kids have so much fun with BUDS & SPLASH.

26,4.0,"Overall, a very good staycation for the family. My child (6 years old) had a lot of fun; like to commend the crew at Buds for being friendly and helpful. There were many interesting areas to play and explore. Room was great as usual. Toilet was clean with the required amenities. Dinner at Line was good, with my compliments to the Indian food in particular. Overall good selection of food; seafood was fresh and the chicken soup was great. Western selection (pasta, pizza and roasted meats) was a bit of a let down. Breakfast at Line was let down frankly speaking. Eggs were overdone, overcooked sausages, cold bread, bad bitter coffee from the machine, hot chocolate tasted bland, overall selection was little. The oats and fruits were good though, and one of the mgr ( i think her name was Syra?) brought some smile to the morning. I seriously recommend that the coffee machines be cleaned regularly or be replaced entirely.  The front of house was very good and helpful; check in and out were a breeze.

29,5.0,"We chose staycation at Shangri-la for our twins' birthday over other hotels because of the children friendly facilities. The entire experience has exceeded our expectations for the various reasons1. Room Upgrade - Nice gesture for room upgrade and an even more pleasant surprise for the birthday deco in the rooms just for the kids! they were over the moon due to the spaciousness of the suite. It was an long overdue staycation due to the pandemic and Shangri-la definitely did not disappoint2. Check in process - was professional, smooth and even the Duty Manager was there to meet & greet, the process did not take long but it was obvious that we have to adhere to mandatory health declaration but it will not take long3. Staff Standard - I can't find faults at all, almost every staff is soo courteous and treat all the guests with service from the hearts, a few outstanding staff who deserve to be mentioned for working so hard. Olive - Housekeeping: Her attentiveness to details was superb and its the little things that touched your heart like turndown service served with sweet macarons, your personal items organised neatly, the children's beds were tucked in nicely with the soft toy placed sweetly on top, fruits baskets always full, her sincere nature really captured the guests' heart!Pui San & Bikash - service staff; our requests were met promptly and service was impeccable. the kids birthday dinner was unforgettable but we had too much and they even offered to pack the complimentary birthday cakes for supper. Pui San was very attentive to my children, the moment she noticed they were restless, she offered coloring sets to them, she almost read my mind! That was top-notch service!Fabian - breakfast service staff: was very prompt with our constant requests as we have hungry children, their food was served promptly and browsing thru the menu via phone was a breeze, just be careful not to over-order! Fabian even offered to top up their personal bottles with water! very personalised serviceThere's so many occasions which represent the high service standards of Shangri-la that it wont be long before we book another staycation4. Experience: If you are looking for a truly family staycation, you are at the right place because there are children friendly facilities, indoor playground (exclusively to hotel guests), baking, splash zone, pool, picnic, afternoon tea & etc... that 2 nights were not sufficient!It will be good if you can plan out the children's activities via phone booking the night before and make sure to arrive on time at the various locations, they need to clean and sanitize the premise after every sessionWarning: Need to endure the snores of overly-tired children, best place to waste their energy!","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
30,5.0,Great stay at the Shangri-La Singapore. Met coming off the coach and everything went well regarding Covid restrictions. Given key to room following a brief meeting with the hotel staff. Stayed on the 14th floor. Meals were 3x a day delivered. Also had the option to get meals delivered in via apps on your phone. This worked well. Staff very attentive and printed out documents and delivered to the room. My room was at the front of the hotel so had great views.,"Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
31,3.0,"Check In - I arrived on a Thursday 1230pm and there was no other guests at the lobby. The strange thing is, the doorman came to open the car door for me as I alighted my Tada and then...... immediately turned around to walk away without offering any assistance with my luggage and laptop. A rather patchy service startMy room was ready, and I was given my welcome letter stating the Valley Wing benefits. I was also given a late(r) check out of 1pm from the original 12pm. My other letter explaining the USD100 dining credit was later slipped under my door.Room - I am all for modern luxury than old school opulence but I really liked my Valley Wing Deluxe King (57SqM)! Although I've seen multiple reviews of the space, nothing beats seeing it in person and I liked it much better than I thought I would. Although dated, the room was spotless and the multiple pockets of space were very well-designed too: the sofas, the work desk, the vanity area, the mini bar, the dressing area. The massive king bed was super comfy too! Welcome amenity was a fruit basket as well as a box of well made chocolates.The bathroom were stocked with L'Occitane toiletries, had a bathtub (have bath salts!), and the double sinks equipped with a set of amenities more than you would ever use for a 2D1N staycation. I liked having the shower and toilet separate for multi-tasking purposes.Afternoon Tea - served from 2-5pm in a set which contains your typical sandwiches, an outstanding chicken ngoh hiang, and desserts which were cloyingly sweet. Scones were also served and they were at most passable. But nothing that a glass of champagne (or four) can't save!Evening Canapés - served from 5-7pm, this comes in a form of a small platter of 4 types of small bites: I saw popcorn chicken (the best), salami squares (okay), brie cheese on crackers (not bad), and mushroom puff (stale). A selection of gin cocktails during this time and because I was tired of champagne at this point, I tried my best to make the best value out of my stay by ordering a compilation of random alcohol. I tried to ask for a second serving of only selected canape items but was told the chef does not allow such mix and match and he 'will not be happy' about it.Breakfast (Summit Room) - We were the 2nd table to be occupied on a Fri morning 8am and service was barely functional. A small buffet of continental items (think cold cuts, cheese, cereal, yoghurt etc) were laid out but you need to approach a staff to take items for you due to COVID measures. Otherwise, you may pick 2 items from the breakfast menu which offers some seasonal items. The Bak Kwa and Char Siew was honestly terrible - rubberized tough cuts of what could have been mystery meat for all I know. Thankfully, the Crispy Egg Confit and Egg Benedict made up for it.Service Issues - Here's the thing. While I do not expect to be fawned over like a VIP, it is still reasonable to expect good service from a Shangri-La, especially at Valley Wing. But apart from 4 individuals who stood out, most times what I saw was really disinterest and unprofessionalism. The doorman was a patchy start. And when we moved our car from the main wings' carpark to one of the Valley Wing lots located in front of the lobby (as advised that we could by one of the staff), we got a semi lecture from the doorman who saw us park - he simply told us that parking lots at the Valley Wing are limited, that they are mostly reserved for long-stay guests, and perhaps next time we can consider parking at the main wing instead. Service was slow at the Valley Wing lobby and it was difficult to get attention at times. During evening cocktails, a staff served us an order and walked away without clearing the soiled plates on the table.Check Out - I got a 2pm check out on the day itself which was nice of them.I'm glad to have experienced the Valley Wing and check this off my list but perhaps unlucky with service this time round.Complete review on Satu Kosong's Travel Blog on wordpress. [Update]: After submitting the post-stay survey, I received a call almost immediately from the Duty Manager who was very concerned about the multiple service issues I highlighted and promised to follow up with an email addressing them. He also said to let him know when I will be next back so he can make sure I get the proper Valley Wing experience. Kudos to them for taking feedback seriously!","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

From check in, we received goody bags for the children and a warm greeting not only for the parents but the tiny ones who are usually ignored. As we walked into our room, we were greeted with a beautiful display of balloons, a cake and a personalised card! During the stay, we were given access to Bud's and Splashzone for each night we were there. Our boys, thoroughly enjoyed the facilities and the staff at each station were friendly and encouraging. We would like to give a special thanks to Hafiz who was always at the door during our stay and greeted us with warmth every time.

Although im doubting if there should be 2 tables in the room. 1 coffee table just by the sofa and another dining table(i assume) just in front of it. The bed however was a totally different story. It was hard as a rock and the pillows, while they looked super fluffy, were almost flat upon lying your head on them. The sleep quality could have been better. The hotel is indeed family friendly with loads of facilities catered to kids like buds, splash zone and even a section of the swimming pool catering to kids. Check in and check out were a breeze.

38,4.0,"I had a good 1 night staycation at the Valley Wing of the Shangri-La Singapore. The most premium wing of the 3 towers; had lived up to its reputation; but with a few reservations. But let’s focus on the positives first. The deluxe room was clean & very spacious. A bit dated but still acceptable for those of a more matured generation. A bottle of red wine, assorted box of chocolates & a platter of fresh fruit was appreciated as with their luxury L’Occitane toiletries. The service button was always promptly answered; despite The Valley Wing being 70% occupied. The legendary ala carte breakfast was the highlight. It certainly failed not; particularly as my expectations were already very high. Special thanks to Butler Jega where his service at the Summit Room for breakfast was meticulous.  Also special thanks to Samuel the Assistant Rooms Director & to his colleague Nora the Front Desk Manager. Both granted me a very personalised attentive service. Other highlights were the all day champagne & other alcoholic drinks.But I stuck with champagne which was the respectable Veuve Clicquot. Now for the negative aspects. The premium Valley Room was not sound proof where I had difficulties sleeping; with chatter from the adjoining room. There has been no serious renovation since 2003. This is unacceptable ! There are no excuses. The plumbing in the bathroom had issues where the temperature regulator in the shower was very temperamental. With regards to the gym changing room, sauna, steam & jacuzzi in the original Tower Wing;  well it certainly has seen better days, perhaps during the 1980s ! Noted it’s partly closed now but it’s very apparent there has been no major upgrade since. The hotel should take the current lull during this pandemic to undertake major renovations. There are now so many luxe competitors & the esteem asset should not rely upon past glories. On another matter; perhaps beyond the control of the hotel. The Valley Wing is designed to cater for the more discriminating clientele. I noticed some guests have not observed the strict dress code, where some were allowed to dress too causally that would render the esteemed wing to a mere country or resort club. Please try to enforce your dress code more firmly. The exclusivity needs to be upheld for all to enjoy. The quality of the food items during the evening cocktails needs to significantly improve.  Noted dinner is not on offer, the evening cocktail food spread in the club lounges amongst your deluxe competition in Singapore; far exceeds the Valley Wing in terms of quality & range.To end on a more positive note; my stay ended with the most amazing Asian massage by Ms Kris Sriwan. Being a global spa enthusiast; I can qualify that Kris was super exceptional ! Well done. Despite my critique; I look forward to my next staycation at the Valley Wing.Best wishes Alan LeongSingapore TripAdvisor level 6 ","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

We were greeted with the usual Shangri-la politeness and efficiency despite the many changes in place due to Covid. Social distancing and cleanliness were well executed and we always felt comfortable in our surroundings.  The room was lovely and spacious and I appreciated all the outlets for charging phones and other gadgets. You'd be surprised how many rooms I've come across with very few and oddly placed outlets.  With the 1 bedroom suite we were supposed to have access to the Tower Wing lounge, however, due to SHN guests in that area of the hotel, we were able to use The Summit Lounge instead. We enjoyed spending time here in the afternoons and The Valley Wing breakfast was outstanding. We were especially impressed with the friendly and service oriented staff. Room service food was also delicious and we were all happy with our orders.  We had the antipasti lunch buffet at The Waterfall restaurant one day and a few items stood out as very good but the others were just average. Our visit was such a nice change of scenery and we enjoyed our stay so much that we will be back in March. Thank you for a wonderful staycation especially during such an unusual and difficult time.

40,2.0,"DISCLAIMER: Not to promote or have bias opinions regarding male or female, purely written based on whatever I experienced during the stay.Staycation Review (28/29 Jan 2021) - 2 male mid-20sShangri-La Valley Wing(Lobby Lounge)Afternoon Tea:Female Attendants were very friendly, drinks served promptly. One of them remembered our special order for the food when we requested a refill. (Rmbing we did not need additional scones portion)Overall, enjoyable afternoon tea time.Evening canapes:We were seated at the single table at the corner and it's just beside the bar. But we were given little to no attention regardless to refilling our drinks or canapes. The most degraded response we got from was when our last serving of canapes came, the attendant serves us while saying its the kitchen's fault since they are closing already (we ordered at 6.30pm but it came at 7pm),left the plate and rolled-back his eyes when we said sorry for the trouble, giving us the feeling of ""looking down at us"" or ""tsk"". I saw it and when he noticed that I saw it, he immediately left after saying ""enjoy"".I certainly did not enjoy the last hot serving of canapes with the drinks.The Summit Room (Breakfast):My partner and I both ordered the Steak & Egg, while he ordered rare for his, I ordered medium-rare. But when it came, my steak was too fresh to be what I ordered and nearer to the rare side.As for the eggs, we both chose the soft boiled eggs, the male attendant asked for my partner's choice of sides but when it came to mine, he didn't remind or ask. (My partner ordered first then it was my turn, I was overwhelmed by selections so forgotten about the sides part.)Only when we were dining halfway through then he ask me, ""eh why you never request for sides"", then I realized. On the other hand, the female attendant was more attentive and even went to get answers to my inquiry as she wasn't familiar with the ingredient of the yogurt.Origin Grill (Lunch):We were seated down with the question of still or sparkling water, we went with still and was served refreshing Evian ($9++). We ordered the SAUTÉED CLAMS IN WINE, PAN-SEARED HOKKAIDO SCALLOPS WITH COCONUT CHILLI JAM, ACQUERELLO AGED ITALIAN RISOTTO and THREE PREPARATIONS OF PORK.I highly recommend the first 3 dishes, the pork dish was underwhelming compared to the 3. But overall the service was good, waitress name Eun Ji was attentive and interactive with us making it a very pleasant lunch experience.Checking out:We proceed to the counter but both were busy attending so we stood there for around 3-4 mins until one of the female attendant came over to seat us down at the lounge while she handed over our room cards to the front desk to help us process.(The whole duration of us standing in front of the counter while waiting, many attendants (3M2F) walked past and made eye contact with me but just turned their heads pretending/looking for guests at the lounge to serve. The female attendant that sat us down wasn't there the whole time we were standing until 3-4mins later, coming in from the Patio seating area entrance)We seated there waiting for our ride to come while seating down, no one bothered to even offer us water, etc. When we stood up and head to the entrance, I can see that the attendants saw us, but chose to ignore our presences I presumed, so we exited the hotel with no greetings and any potential positive remembrance.SUMMARY: The stay's most memorable will be the lounge's drinks and snacks, Origin Grill lunch, and Summit Room's food quality. The service was definitely disappointing with the extra help of ""looking down on you"" or ""you don't belong/fit in here"" vibes.  Maybe we were too young for them to take us seriously, I guessed.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Full of rave reviews here about great service and how kids are so happy here. I wish to cover something more basic or what a traveler is looking for.The bed is firm and it’s totally reminds me of hotel beds in China hotels. The interior is old whole grandeur / resort which also is a very popular interior choice of Chinese hotels in China. Maybe because I usually book newly build hotels that are modern, edgy and hip so that I can observe new interior trends, materials and new design. This totally feels like the type of hotel my China suppliers will book for us. Feels very on the road for me.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Also the lobby lounge is luxurious and the service was stunning. They offer wide selection of drink menu, including champagne, cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages.

47,5.0,"Our 1st staycation since the C-virus reached the shores of S'pore, in 23 Jan. 2020.Now I understand why this hotel is a hot favorite with locals and tourists.The exceptional level of customer service was experienced when I stepped into the lobby.Mr Ono noticed me standing in queue and offered his assistance. He explained why it seemed crowded, how long the wait might be and suggested we wait in the nearby lounge.I was grateful that although all the parking lots beside the building were occupied, he moved aside a signboard and guided me as I reversed my car into the space he created.Ms Noara put a smile on my kids' faces when she offered 2 squirrels (soft toys). Realizing that I would like a new view from the room-window, she reserved a room on a high floor, with a great view.The hotel room and bathroom were very spacious and room attendant Yan Hong, made sure it was in pristine condition.We appreciate the extra amenities - kids' toiletries, bathrobe, slippers. We used the 'clean' gift pack of face masks and hand sanitizer.It was a pleasant surprise to see a wifi-enabled color printer with good quality paper, under the spacious desk.The good size swimming pool was clean and surrounded by tress. It was patrolled by very focused lifeguards. One of the lifeguards apologized for asking guests to leave the pool because of the risk of lightning. Another, advised my kid to wear the life vest, because he swam alone and the deepest end of the pool was 2.5 m. I noticed the pool manager Ah Chye, wrap a towel around a girl who was left unattended and shivering, beside the pool.Lunch at The Origin Grill was pleasant. Besides the delicious and well-prepared dishes, the restaurant manager was very courteous, suggested the type of dessert and checked on us a few times.We spent quite some time dining at the lobby lounge and Summit room. All the staff at the lobby, lounge and Summit room were very hospitable and made us feel at ease. When one of the chefs noticed me peering into the kitchen, he offered his assistance, to order drinks. We found ourselves taking a slower pace; walking, speaking slowly and soaked in the sights and sounds. We teased the friendly birds which gathered around our table (outdoor), took a stroll around the large garden and admired the many Orchids on display.Dinning in the Valley Wing was a lux indulgence which included silverware, Foie Gras, Caviar, Gold and Silver leaves.Burned off the calories in the sprawling, most well-equipped gym I have ever stepped foot in. It carried all my favorite exercise equipment and 40 kg dumb bells ! Shangri-la even considered the temperature of the bottled, oxygenated water in the fridge. The water was cool, but too cold, which is appropriate for gym-patrons.Mr Jega Nathan's wine-recommendation was suited our tastes perfectly. He made our day with the little ""extras"" he threw in. For example, on hearing that we liked spinach and he offered extra spinach with the dish we ordered. My kids requested for nuts and he added chips and popcorn, which they also loved. We shared that we were reluctant to check out and he offered us high tea, so we had a good ""excuse"" to spend several more, lingering minutes in Shangri-la.Mr Jimmy Xu went out of his way to organize the staycation package which was truly memorable. My kids will cherish the Shangri-la moments and requested that we return more often, soon ","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
48,5.0,"We stayed at the Valley Wing at Shangri-La over New Years and it was an amazing experience! The stay was very luxurious - the staff take note of your smallest preferences and ensure you have a pleasant stay. The room itself was huge and very comfortable. They included Mustela kids amenities for my son and even gave him a stuffed toy (squirrel) upon arrival - he loved the treatment! The splash zone is particularly fun for all - we went there every day during our stay. Our son also loves buds and we were pleased they had a drop-off option for 4 and above - it gave us some downtime as well :) And yes, we need to book time-slots for the splash zone and buds (the link is provided on arrival), but this was really easy and we always got the timings we wanted. I also loved the beautiful gardens at Shangri-La - the Orchid is a beautiful addition to their landscape!We can't wait to return again!","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
49,2.0,"Was looking to this stay as we are celebrating a special occasion with a stay at the Valley Wing. There were so many things to look forward to but to our disappointment. 1. Attention to Guest at the Champagne/Lobby LoungeThere aren’t many guests around but it is so difficult to get the attention of the wait staff on several occasions. 2. Attention to Guest at the PatioWe were relaxing at the Cabana located just at the Patio section and ordered drinks with the wait staff. After waiting for an hour, seeing them serving the Cabana beside us and not us, we were baffled and re-ordered. However, the drinks still did not reach us and we just left. 3. Food Delivery to the RoomWe ordered some takeout and the hotel reception called us to come to collect the food instead of sending up. We understand it may be due to the governmental/hotel policy so we didn’t think too much. 10 minutes after I collected the food, there was a knock on my door and to my surprise, the hotel staff was sending a takeout food to my room, though it was a wrong room number. That left one thinking why there are service differences. 4. Rooms AllocatedThe hotel was well aware that we are celebrating a special occasion, yet they assigned us to a room with a toddler. We were awoken several times in the night due to the relentless crying of the toddler. That destroyed our rest and we were just annoyed. Understand the Valley Wing maybe going through a full-capacity situation but I’m sure they would have known to reshuffle guest knowing off the “situation”. 5. Final Drinks at the Champagne Lounge As we did not get to have our cake last night, we decided to have one at the Champagne Lounge before check out. Understand it maybe the hotel policy to stop serving checking out guest but the delivery of the messages could be nicer instead of; I quote “This drinks will be complimentary and you have to pay for the next one that you order”. We don’t think the wait staff was meant to be rude but delivery does matter. It might be due to a sudden surge of guest but again, we expect a decent service standard at this hotel, especially the Valley Wing given the high praises/recommendation of many. 6.  Service at Check Out Not sure if I’m overthinking but usually at check out, the reception staff will enquire on your stay and experience. However, none of this happened and they just proceed to process the check out. They didn’t even offer complimentary car park slip and forgot all about it. Had to go back to the counter to ask again before leaving the hotel. All in all, having stayed at many hotels in the world (with or without status the chain), I find that my experience here is definitely the worst and this is not what I expect fromShang. I certainly would not come back here as the level of service is certainly appalling.The hotel management should definitely review their service standard or they might have more of such reviews in the making. Just my two cents. ","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

55,1.0,"Currently checked into the hotel this weekend, all excited for our staycation for a belated bday celebration for our baby who turned one. Came with high expectations after reading the reviews online, hence requested for early checkin at 2pm if possible for baby’s feed time. Checkin process was no issue but the person attending to us left a very sour taste in my entire experience as the first person to attend to us. JOVINN wasnt warm in her welcome, DID NOT explain about my booking and rooms to me, DID NOT explain about how i can book for Buds and Splash Zone. She did not explain about things i usually would experience. I had 2 bookings for my parents in law as well and i requested for same floor or connecting rooms if possible and i understand if we cant get it since we are only requesting for it that moment, BUT she kept emphasizing my requests are last minute (you could have just said its not available) and not keep making me feel inadequate. It was 2.30 when we checked in and although i emailed for early checkin she did not even try to fasten the process for us. no worries if its not ready but i do have a baby to care for and your hotel is supposed to be kid friendly. Jovinn did not even care to explain to me about the facilities in the hotel whilst i wait for my room. Was curt in her replies and even cut me off when i asked something.Really very disappointing that we had to miss our splash zone timing cos we only got our room after 330 and i received no call that my room was ready! Thank God for Shawn Tan for his amazing recovery skills when i check d at 320 with him if my room is ready. He gave us complimentary drinks whilst we wait and HIS SERVICE IS AMAZING really made us feel better. Travelling with a baby is no easy feat hence service really plays a huge role in ensuring that we get checked in seamlessly. Also a family who chrcked in 45 mins after us got their room upgraded. Really didnt enjoy our stay here although the amenities are amazing.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Could the management seriously look into Zilas conduct as she totally ruined my staycation and this has never happened before for shangri la. Intend to also report her conduct to management too.

We proceeded straight to splash zone after changing and it was very fun except that there were many leaves in the water. One thing to mention is that the lady at the Splash zone (sorry didn’t get her name) is very helpful and friendly. When I went back to the locker to get my phone, she approached me and let me know how I could use back the existing locker without moving my things to another locker. I find it a very nice gesture with initiative. :)The hotel is also surrounded by nice greenery and beautiful koi fishes and waterfall which is soothing and relaxing. Overall we love the environment very much! We also had ice cream at the waterfall kiosk beside the pool and then had our dinner at The Line. Food was great and serving is very fast.We visited Buds the next morning where we have to pay $18 for a child (except if you are in family theme rooms). Oh ya please bring socks along otherwise it’s chargeable at $5/pair. It’s pretty fun for the kids! I think my daughter enjoyed it very much! They even made a badge for her birthday!The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bed is not very comfortable. It is too hard and the 2 pillows provided are too soft. We didn’t sleep well at all and unfortunately woke up with aches.. we were also rejected for an hour longer check out so we missed the hotel’s pool. But we will still be back to explore!

60,5.0,"In my last review I shared about the lesser-than-stellar service experience that we had during our stay at Valley Wing about 5  months ago. In response to my review, the General Manager hoped to welcome us back for a renewed experience again at the hotel. Well, we were back again, to spend our New Year at Valley Wing.The very moment I stepped out of the car at Valley Wing entrance, I could sense the difference. I was readily greeted by friendly and helpful doorman Ryan who immediately came forward to help me with my bag and opened the entrance door for me. He also offered to keep our bags to be sent up to our room later (yes, our bags were already in our room when we went up an hour later). As both front desk counters were occupied, a staff by the name of Noel immediately attended to us by ushering us to the Lobby Lounge and gave us a personalised check-in. We sat comfortably on the sofa, sipping champagne while Noel went through the check-in process with us. Such warm hospitality didn’t exist 5 months ago when the hotel had just started to accept staycations. I must say my impression which still stood till at 5 months ago changed at that very moment.Another pleasant surprise was that afternoon tea and evening cocktails were now served at the Summit Room, buffet style with wider varieties and the guests could choose and pick (with the help of the staffs) the food items that they like. The experience was definitely more enjoyable than the previous standard two-tiers afternoon tea set and 5 finger food items served on a plate during evening cocktails. During that time, guests were not allowed to have a refill of certain food item without having the whole set. With the new system in place, guests could now have unlimited servings of their desired food item.The biggest improvement was that the staffs were now very attentive and their service was definitely impeccable. Despite being full occupancy, the service rendered by the Valley Wing team was not compromised. Friendly staffs would constantly go around tables attending to guests’ needs. Flowrence always swung by our table to ensure that our glasses were filled and checked on our needs. Used plates were also cleared away quickly. Compared to our previous stay whereby it was a mission impossible to get the staffs’ attention for anything and everything, I was truly impressed with the great effort that the Valley Wing team had put together for the excellent service experience that we had during our recent stay.I reviewed that the staffs were not ready to serve 5 months ago, but now,  Shangri-La Hotel definitely lives up to her reputation of being a luxury hotel with top notch service. A renewed experience indeed. ","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
61,2.0,"I have had 4 staycations at different five-star hotels recently and this was the most disappointing out of the lot.  Stayed for a night on a Sunday. We only managed to check in past 4pm as our room wasn't ready - we were given two coupons for complimentary welcome drinks while waiting, and the reception was extremely polite, so that was fine. We were initially allocated a room on the 4th floor with a pool view (which I would recommend that you avoid; the lobby is on the 3rd floor), but to our horror, there was a trail of ants on the table after we came back from dinner (I have photos and a video) - we didn't eat in the room and had only made coffee. We called them immediately and they suggested getting housekeeping to do some cleaning - I insisted on a change of room as having ants in the room was rather unbearable for me. We got a room on the 9th floor, and apart from very slow drainage in the shower, there were no other issues. It was also a rather unpleasant surprise to find out that Shangri-la houses people serving SHNs at the Garden Wing - we only realised it when we were moved to the 9th floor - looking down, you could see chairs draped with black cloth lined outside each door on the 8th and 7th floor. I had thought that they house people serving SHNs in the Tower Wing, since the Garden Wing was open to families and those on staycations, and thought that if that were the case, guests should be informed in advance.Would expect them to at least allow us to extend the check out timing by an hour or so given the late check in, but they rejected our request outright citing full occupancy on a Monday. Also, they called at around 12.15pm to hurry us to check out.All these were communicated to the staff who attended to us upon checking out, and she assured us that the feedback will be passed on to the management. All in all, would expect more from Shangri-la.These aside, Shangri-la is rather self-contained with many facilities and you do get the ""resort"" feel if you stay at the Garden Wing - room was also spacious. The pool and gym are huge. It is a 10 to 15 minutes' walk to Orchard Road (not really convenient if you intend to take public transport), and breakfast was very average (tried the scrambled eggs, nasi lemak and chicken congee; no freshly squeezed juices as well) - they cut off orders at 10.30am sharp so be sure to arrive early.Given our experience, Shangri-la will not be our first choice for staycations in future.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Breakfast laksa is great, but the letdown was the cleaning cloth left in the room - apparently housekeeping was in a bit of hurry! Big no no especially for a world-class hospitality brand, and haste in cleaning a room is the last thing you want especially in covid times. Otherwise it would have been a pretty good experience.

63,5.0,"Had a 3D2N staycation to usher in 2021 from our room at the fabulous Valley Wing.We were impressed with the vast improvement as compared to our experience of last staycation in July 2020.  We were happy that the hotel has beefed up their staffing to ensure prompt and attentive service at all times.  Despite it was a super peak period during the year end, we did not feel that the service was compromised in any way.  The other major improvement was the variety and quality of the food offered during afternoon tea and the happy hours.  Guests now are able to enjoy them inside Summit Room with the team of friendly staff from Valley Wing helping to deliver the food items selected by the guests.  The only disappointment was that our favourite Japanese set was removed from the Summit Room's breakfast menu and there wasn't any offering on noodles which is a common local breakfast item though it's available at the Line. It was unfortunate that we could not enjoy the pool as much as we could too due to the exceptional wet weather.It was remarkable that the whole team at Valley Wing had worked cohesively from the top to the bottom, helping each other out during the busy period to ensure quality service being rendered to the guests at all times. We had an enjoyable and comfortable stay and we look forward in going back again soon.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
64,5.0,"Shangri-La hotels are best known for luxury and their well appointed amenities. I stayed at the one located at Orchard for a good period of 10 days. It is as beautiful from inside as it is from outside. The balconies adorned with flowers all over, looked straight out of a movie. Indeed a picturesque property it is.I had booked a 1 BHK apartment there. It was a spacious one BHK ever. A large dining space, an enclosed kitchenette with all necessary vessels in place, a large bedroom with a king size bed and a bathroom. Although we didn’t get the balcony, but the space was large enough for a family to survive. The housekeeping service is superb, they try to serve you at the earliest. There was only one thing that bothered me and that was the washer/dryer which was common for the floor. So, there is a possibility that one has to wait for their turn and this happened with me twice. The property has facilities like swimming pool and a tennis court. One can access their hotel services too like gymnasium etc. The staff is very cordial and nice. They offer great dining options as well.So, if you are looking for a great serviced apartment at a great location with all the amenities, this one makes for a great deal, though it’s on an expensive side. But, try booking this in advance coz this one is usually fully booked.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

69,3.0,"My wife and I booked the couples retreat staycation package for stay during the Christmas weekend. While the hardware was good, we were disappointed and felt that the package was not fulfilled. Under the package, we were entitled to 50% off for couples massage. However, the spa was fully booked during our stay. We were given $50 dining credit, and additional 20% discount off food. However, the Waterfall Italian restaurant was fully booked during our stay. In the end, we redeemed a bottle of wine instead. In the Expedia booking, one of the features stated was early in at 10am and late check out at 2pm, subject to availability. Needless to say, the hotel was fully booked and no early check in nor late check out was allowed. During the stay, we requested daily newspapers but were informed to download an app which would provide online access to the papers. As it turned out, the app seemed to only have one local newspaper, which is already available online without any subscription required. The rest of the magazines in the app were mostly outdated, with one that I picked dated 2017. All in all, it is probably better to just book a standard room without the couples retreat package. Although the hotel did send me a message 2 weeks before check in to consider making spa and dining reservations, we did not do so as we preferred a rest and relax break without planning a program well in advance. We had assumed that given we had booked a  couples retreat package, the hotel would ensure that guests would be able to enjoy what is provided for in the package. We gave feedback to the staff during our stay and checkout. The staff was apologetic but that was it. Not what I expected from a Shangri la. ","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

However, though nice, we did not get the wow feeling that we got from our staycations at Fullerton and Andaz, both of which were equally great and wonderful!We stayed for 1 night in the Garden Wing.  Room was spacious, very well maintained, but dated.  And there was not much of a garden view from our room.  Thanks for the nice cake for our anniversary delivered to our room!Hotel has a nice grand lobby.  Breakfast at The Line was sumptuous.  Staff there were attentive and service was prompt. Gym and pool were great.We had lunch at the Waterfall Restaurant which turned out to be disappointing.  The hotel also messed up the bill, and added the dining credit to the bill, instead of subtracting from it.  Although this was finally settled by the duty manager, it left a bad after-taste.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

And when I was worried that they wouldn’t be ready.. they told me that they were all long prepared and ready so that I’d be sure to get the baskets even if I move the pick up date forward!

74,5.0,"I booked a 3D2N family playcation package at the hotel and stayed at the garden wing. Check in was a pleasant experience- despite there being a crowd, a staff attended to me and ushered me to the next available receptionist. Grace, the receptionist recognized that we were celebrating my wife's birthday during the stay and wished her promptly. There was a birthday amenity placed in the room along with a personalized birthday card which made for a great start to the staycation.Everything great about this hotel(amenities, friendly staff, great dining options) has been mentioned so i won't elaborate on that here. What I wish to highlight is the level of hospitality that the shangri la strives to achieve. From addressing me by name with each phone call, to their attentiveness to the needs of the children, i was blown away by the level of service shown by all the staff. It's apparent that the staff have been trained to relate to guests and i enjoyed the little conversations that i had with each staff from check in to check out. The cherry on the cake for me was when the guest relations manager called to wish my wife happy birthday. This gesture was significant as it was an effort by the hotel to recognize that this stay carried with it a symbolic meaning of a celebratory event. And for that, shangrila has earned another fan. I will certainly be back.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
75,5.0,"This is my third staycation in singapore in the last 6 months and was definitely the best by a long shot.  I stayed 2 nights /  3 days at the Shangri la - Orchard , with my wife and 8 year old daughter.  I initially booked the garden wing suite but was upgraded to the valley wing suite , which was much better.  The valley wing rooms are more modern and equipped that the garden wing rooms.  The valley wing suite was very spacious, luxurious and comfortable. We also really enjoyed the valley wing lounge access which had free flowing drinks including champagne all day and canapes in the afternoon and evening.  The Shangri la is amazing for families with young kids.  My daughter enjoyed the splash zone , ginger bread decorating class, buds, the pool etc.  One recommendation is to do the bookings of these kids places immediately upon check in as they get filled really fast.Breakfast options are good and service was fast.  We ate at the waterfall Italian restaurant and the lobby lounge,  both of which were good and reasonable.  One thing that stands out about Shangri la- Orchard , is the very helpful and customer oriented staff . One staff to call out was Asst mgr - Mica , who made our stay extremely pleasant and pro-actively responded to all our queries/ requests.   I did have an issue during check in but once it was escalated to Mica , it was resolved very professionally and amicably.We all thoroughly enjoyed our staycation at Shangri la orchard and look forward to planning another one in the next few months.

Seriously, I thought 2 nights were long but I kinda regret now - should've booked more nights!!! The staff were warm, friendly - made me felt really like I was on a vacation and with the poolside drinks & food, time really flew past while we were all relaxing around and in pool. Activities scheduled by Buds team were also fun - my kids are tweens so they didn't like the kiddish stuff but Buds had activities like Tie-Dye shirt & baking to keep them entertained for a while. :) We'll be back in Mar next year - I will definitely book more nights then!

Although we couldn’t choose what to eat but it was sufficient as we couldn’t ask for me. This is customer service at its best! NB: There were a few staff that simply ignored us. Worst, there was one that pretend that we are invisible despite waving our hand at him. Ask for Mr Manoj! Thanks for going for the extra mile.

They have all made our stay in Shangri-la an enjoyable and pleasant experience! Kudos to the receptionist whom attended to us when we came earlier for check in and the staff arranged for an upgrade to a bigger room for us (with no extra charge). She made this special arrangement so that we won’t have to wait too long (originally we booked Garden view) for the room to be ready and hence we were able to go into our upgraded room right away. On top of that, the staff also arranged for us to have complimentary drink at The Line. Staff Nicholas from The Line served us with warm welcome and provided my kids with colouring activity while we enjoy our drink! He also served us during our Breakfast and recommended very nice Teh Tarik to us. He came to check of us occasionally and once again making sure my kids are occupied with activities while we’re enjoying our food! Many thanks to him for leaving a good impression. We would like to compliment him for his excellent service. Another staff that we would like to compliment is Staff Chew from the Line too. She was the one who served us most of the time and checking on our needs and recommended the signatures that we should not miss.

Staff happily and patiently answered our questions. Our bags made it to our rooms even faster than us. Meals arrived on time as scheduled. They were generally nice, with some tasted better than others. I ordered some food from Grab and another delivery company and they were promptly delivered to the room by the concierge.

84,5.0,"We just completed a 3 night family staycation at the hotel and all I can say is superb on every level. The standout was the staff. Every single staff member we engaged with was happy, polite, friendly and helpful. They knew their job, they helped solve, they asked if we were okay. It was service at a level that justifies the cost and the experience. We stayed in the valley wing, highly recommended for all the extras. The family play cation package added to the experience for our 7 and 9 year old boys. Pool access was well managed, and despite it being busy and only a 3 minute taxi drive from our house it felt like we had got on a plane and flown off to somewhere exotic, fun and fabulous. This is our second staycation post circuit breaker, and as a family we cannot fault the experience. Special shout out to zila at the check in desk, and the lovely gentleman who was working in the summit room who talked about how he had worked for shangri-la for 20 years. Both of them, and all of their colleagues, are a shining example of great people doing great things in tough times. Really really well played and worth it. ","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
85,5.0,"It was a lovely experience staycationing in the Shangri-la's Valley Wing. Upon arrival, you feel like you have returned to your luxurious home. The reception by the old Japanese bellman was so professionally done. You may forget that you are in Japan. The check-in by the manager, Nora, was again done so professionally. It was like talking to a friend. Our luggage was all ready in our room when we entered. There was a quiet element of WOW FACTOR. The view was great and the room was wonderful. Spacious and well planned room with an equally spacious and exceptionally functional bathroom, with all its defined spaces.Perks of staying at the Valley Wing ... many! An exclusively peaceful and quiet sanctuary !You can choose to sip your champagne or Singapore Sling and more from anytime between 11 am till 10 pm in the lobby lounge. Drinkers - take note! You can indulge in more food in the Summit Room next to the lobby. There's high tea included (2-5 pm) and evening canapés (5-7 pm) too. However, there is room for improvement for the food served during tea and evening canapés.After which, you can continue to enjoy more drinks... from hard liquor to cocktail and mocktail, Irish whisky, rose wine, reisling, ...The breakfast selection was the best. They even offered steak and egg... It was delicious! The breakfast selection was wide and well thought of, serving both western and Asian choices. They even have our local popular dish - Nasi lemak (a coconut rice dish with spicy ingredients on the side : otah, chicken curry, fried ikan bilis with peanuts, fried egg, sambal chilli on the side). We had double portion of steak and egg and an egg Benedict. The fruit selection was amazing... all types of berries (blue berries, raspberries, black berries, strawberries) and an array of other fruits! They served a small but good range of pastries which keep both adults and kids happy. The roasted turkey breast was smokey and nice. The smoked salmon was a tad too salty.The theme in the hotel lobby and Summit Room is especially beautiful with the advent of Christmas. There are beautifully adorned Christmas trees of all sizes, with beautiful decorations of Tin Soldiers, both big and small everywhere! It's super relaxing to laze around the lobby for a sip or two ... then return to your own sanctuary for a hot dip ... and finally slip into your soft plushy bed for a good snooze.

87,1.0,"The initial warmth and speedy service soon faded away as I checked-in to my room with them. The food was grotesque. Would you ever eat quinoa with raisins paired with beansprouts and tofu? I mean the chef seems like a very confused person and shouldn't a trained chef in a supposed 5 star hotel know the difference on how western and asian food hits your taste palette. I'm not suggesting fine dining but if you can't do fusion, stick to the basics, possibly cheaper too. On top of that, I was told that your pastry was made the night before and sent out to the rest of the Shangri-La group hotels and thus the extremely bad pastry. It's soggy and disgusting, being in the F&B business you'd know to eat pastry fresh or even hours of making of making it. Simple guys, think simple. Apparently, the water you get at almost all SHN facilities isn't part of this package. We have to boil the water from the toilet and drink it... You wouldn't serve that to your family at home now would you? This experience has shown me that you don't value people serving their SHN with you. Like honestly, if you guys are going to do a half arse job about this and not even provide water or even get the basics in catering right don't don't sign up as a SHN facility. Do the people that will potentially serve their SHN a favour, give them a chance to stay somewhere better than here where they are valued. Seems like your food will get me ill not Rona. Kuok family really ain't running this place well.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5
88,4.0,"While I have been to this hotel for a number of times, this visit was my first staycation here. We were here primarily for the Buds and Splashzone. Else we are more likely found in the main Orchard road hotels for a shopping staycation or Sofitel Sentosa for a relaxing stay.One day prior to the check-in, I received an online check-in notification through their app and what surprised me was the incidental deposit the hotel has requested. For a 2 nites stay, I was asked to put up a $1.5+k deposit for incidental charges and this amount also included the room rate. Issue here is that I have already fully paid for the room rate a few months back and thus, why are they charging me for the room rate again? Nonetheless, I proceed to make the payment to facilitate the online check-in.Upon arrival, the lobby was grand for a hotel of this status but the check-in was rather rushed, probably due to an influx of guests. Room, while old, was reasonably maintained and cleanliness was top notch. The room has a lovely balcony for those who like to sip some wine while having a chat.Shang has set up a roll-away bed for my toddler though we didn’t request for it as he will sleep with us on the king sized bed. What initially impressed me subsequently turned into a billing nightmare, where I noted from the app that I was being charged for this roll-away bed. While this issue was resolved with a phone call to the front desk, it leaves a sour taste especially when it happens at Shang, which is a huge disappointment. Coupled with the initial online check-in incidental charges requested for (which included another round of room charges), I lost confidence in their billing system.Having said that I will like to commend Lynn, from the front desk, which I thot did a great job in reassuring me during our phone conversation and while most people will have stop after the phone conversation, she followed up with an email. She has salvaged the rating for Shang.When it comes to meals time Shang probably has the largest number of restaurants among its peers, offering a few types of cuisines for selection.We had 2 tea breaks during our stay at the Lobby Lounge and it offers a cosy environment for a relaxing moment. The first round, as we were rushing for Buds, we did not stay long to enjoy the tranquility. During the second visit, we were able to better enjoy the experience.Dinner was at the Line during our first nite and I deemed that they are not ready or reasonably trained to handle ala-Carte buffet. My first order of the seafood platter took more than half an hour to arrive and they only arrived after I checked with them. Will deemed this to be a missed order as seafood platter are already pre-cooked and to plate them takes no longer than a minute. The same thing happened to the sashimi. In my review this lapse was not faulted as based on my experience, Singapore hotels are now ready for ala-carte buffet.It was noted that some guests were given a log cake to bring home, so likely the Line offers a complimentary cake for guests who celebrate their birthdays there, which is a nice gesture of the restaurant.During our time at the swimming pool we ordered some snacks and we had a great experience with the pool bar service staff.Room service- While we did not ordered room service, we noted that the neighbouring guests did as a room service cart with empty plates and food remnants was placed outside the corridor. I first saw it at 2+pm when I checked in and after I finished my dinner, which was near 9pm, the cart was still there. It could be a case whereby guests did not inform the room service team to clear it. Conversely it also meant that no hotel staff pass by the corridor nor CCTV picking this up throughout these 7hrs which is a lengthy period when it comes to hygiene, especially when the corridor is next to an open garden.Next, the stars of this staycation, the Buds and the Splashzone. The Buds did not disappoint and while not large, it has a nice mixture of indoor playground and painting fun. My kiddo has a great time there. The Splashzone is another great addition into Shang and it provides another venue for kiddo to drain their energy and have fun.However it appeared that Shang has cut the visit time for both these venues from 90 till 60 minutes though.Collating the above experience, this hotel would have been rated 3.5 stars but given that Lyn has done a great recovery, she salvaged half a star for Shang. As such, I will be rating it 4 stars.Will I stay again? Probably yes, only for the Buds and Splashzone.","Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",4.5

We really appreciated the outstanding service and Le Yi who served us in the lounge was particularly friendly. The massages we had with our package massages were very good.  We are vegetarian and although they had options in the lounge, it was a bit limited and they did not create additional dishes to compensate for this (as they did at the Ritz), which would have been appreciated.

But at shangri la there are lots of activities for the little ones so would strongly recommend to families with young kids. special thanks to haliz, iflah, hyen yen. there was a filipino male staff at buds who was so nice too but i didnt manage to get his name. he was giving me advice on how to change my splashzone resevation due to the rain. my 6 yr old boy enjoyed his stay there. He got to do gingerbread cookies, play at the buds indoor playgrd and the splashzone. My son had such a great time. My husband felt the room was too dim. I also felt cleanliness was acceptable but could be improved given the high standards of shangrila. chairs and corners were slightly dusty. location wasnt the most ideal for me as they only have a shuttle daytime mon-fri currently and its a walk to the main town area (ie takashimaya). Given that its the rainy season, it makes it even less convienient. so, I would adults would probably prefer fullerton a tad more. also, do make a reservation at the line if you are planning for a meal.

Check-in staff Miss  Jovinn for making the additional arrangements on top of what I believed had already been pre-arranged. She is detailed and is knowledgeable to address me queries. Her sweet and warm disposition really made our check-in enjoyable and delightful. 2. Mdm. Jenny, our room attendant. She made a point to pause her work when she saw us leaving our room to greet us and to find out if there is anything she could help while we are away. We are happy with the level of cleanliness in our room. 3. To the staff whom did the shoe-shine for us. Whoever you are, Thank you so much. We can see the effort you put into making our shoes shine. 4. We really appreciate the promptness of all other staff whom attended to our room service requests. It was executed according to the time as per our instructions. Swift, enthusiastic and warm. We cannot be more than amazed. Thank you. 5. Pool. This perhaps is the only place I have to be proactive to find out what are the phase 2 safety measures in place. We were there mid afternoon, The pool was not crowded. There were less than 5 small groups of guests. No staff came forward to welcome and provide advisory. We do feel neglected. The staff cluttered around the main tent. When we settled down on our own at our tanning decks, one man came over and asked if I like to have foot massage. This came pretty abruptly and I am kind of clueless what to expect from him. I didn't probe further after declining him. We had also enjoyed our complimentary bespoke cocktails at the lounge. The fine men and women there sure were friendly and make sure we are having a great time despite they were so busy relocating the Christmas decorations.

We decided to upgrade to the Valley Wing Indulgence package a few days before arrival and the reservation team was happy to help with this no problems. What an indulgence it was - we had access to the lounge with daily afternoon tea and evening canapés along with UNLIMITED Moet champagne and cocktails. In addition it included a 90 minute massage at the Chi Spa. I would say go ahead pay that extra $200 per room just to upgrade, it’s so worth it! The rooms were spacious and clean. Bathroom was huge and plenty of wardrobe space. They had set up balloons and cake for my friend which was a lovely touch. The only improvement I would say is that the rooms were a little dated and in need of more charging points. Plus Bluetooth connected speaker would have been nice.

Rooms are quite small but comfortable, more suitable for staycay people who don’t need much space or don’t stay indoors all the time. Be careful when taking up their early check in request as encountered their staff biting back at me for checking in early when I requested for late check out as my family and I are heading out on check out day and was afraid might not come back in time to check out so asked as a precaution.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

7,5.0,"Booked this hotel after reading the many good reviews left by guests. Many thanks to the hotel to accommodate our request for adjoining rooms, the early check-in, and the birthday surprise delivered by Yolanda.Many thanks also to Eswari and Aldrina for the patience shown in clarifying the parking charges. S$21.40 for a single-use exit pass regardless of the number of hours/days stayed. The location of this hotel is very good. There are many big shopping malls and food establishments right beside it. The MRT is very nearby too. The room layout is somewhat unconventional with the bathroom located right against the exterior windows. This means guests have to choose between privacy or good view and natural light.  It also means lots of curtains up/down. It will take some getting used to by some.Our family has enjoyed our staycation with this hotel. Despite the abovementioned layout, the rooms are very cozy. The Komyuniti Restaurant located at Level 10 is a good place to dine in also. It is doing relatively well despite the many Covid-19 restrictions in place. Their prices are reasonable.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

You can ask for extra towel, mineral water, shaving kit again. Reception lobby and drop off area is located at level 2. During check in you have to scan the qr code. Then the staff would direct you to the counter and assist you to check in. Need to fill up form and write in your full nric number (not last 4 digits) and date of birth. This is for all guests and visitors. Room floor and room number is already assigned to you. Similar to airline self check in system where you can't choose the floor or room. The lobby is like a touch and go station. No seat or sofa like other 4* and 5* hotels in Singapore. Seems like a ""budget check-in station"".If you have used your credit card as deposit during the check in, they would deduct $50 from you card. If no extra cost incurred, they would refund you within the next 7 days. If you use credit card for deposit, you can check out using the machine.

A robot- Yolanda came up to sing my partner a birthday song with macarons and card signed by the staff.  The gym experience was just good as well. It was an enjoyable stay and we wouldlove to come back again next time. We love the robot too. :) ,YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5
27,4.0,Quite as okay hotel for its price. But the shower is not suitable for 3 people. Should at least provide an extra blind outside the toilet to prevent others from looking inside while others are showering. As people may mistake this as a hotel made for couples for other purposes.,YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

There is also a HDMI port on the wall beside the bed though I did not try it. A number of power points and USB power ports provided around the room.Front desk staff approachable and knowledgeableI chose the Premium Queen View and was given a high floor looking towards Newton area.

35,4.0,"Wanted to simply stay here due to the robots. Specially called to request for some small items to be delivered to us and I can say definitely the highlight of our trip. Room wise-we know it is small. 3 adults to move around, it is a squeeze...but can’t complain as we know that’s what we have signed up for. Bathroom was okie, just that I think you need to be highly comfortable with one another as somehow, you would be able to the a bit of the silhouette of the person in the bathroom. At least it wasn’t an issue for us. Bed was very soft. Need to find spots with not so soft bed. But number of pillows was definitely enough. Highly recommended if you only need the hotel to sleep and rest. If you want to just stay in the hotel to enjoy the facilities...then I would choose other options. ",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5
36,4.0,"Since we have not utilize the SRV vouchers, we thought it would be nice to book a short staycation before the school reopen. I came across Yotel Orchard, which is in a nice location in Orchard, and it seems like a cool hotel, with the futuristic theme. The price was reasonable considering, it can sleep 3 persons and come with breakfast as well. We arrive slightly later at 3pm to check in, and there was no crowd in the lobby. We used the mission-control (manned counter) to check in, and pay an additional top up for the overnight parking which came up to be $21.40.After checking in, we went to the 10th floor to book the time slot for the swimming pool. The pool is quite small, and with children playing in it, you have to watch where you swim.The room was nice and clean, everything looks well maintained, and my son loves the bunkbed. The queen size bed was alright, a bit too soft and my husband did not really enjoy it, but I am fine with it. The real issue came at night, when my son started moving around while he sleeps and this generating squeaking sound, that woke us up multiple times. So it may be a good idea to put someone that does not move in his/her sleep in the top bunk bed.During check in, we also reserve our slot at breakfast. We order breakfast from a checklist, and each person is entitled to 1 set of breakfast, it includes some pastry, salad, yogurt and yogurt to start, the main course can be chosen from a choice of Western, Congee or Noodles. The Western was the nicest of the 3 options. For the drinks, you have a choice of coffee/tea, fruit juice or milk, you can top up the drinks if required. Overall, the pastries and breakfast is pretty decent and filling.It is a good stay with no frills at a convenient location.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

75,4.0,"Choosing a hotel has always been according to what you need for that specific period of stay. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were welcomed by a clean, quiet and sleek view of the lobby - self service kiosks on the left, robots on the right and service counters in front of us. The premium view bunk room is an experience, but slightly small for a 3 pax. Nonetheless, the high floor view on beside the bathroom/ toilet is certainly pleasing and satisfying. Don't forget to close the blinds before using though ",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

77,5.0,"This was our first staycation since the pandemic started. We enjoyed our stay. The location is conveniently located just a stone's throw from Orchard MRT and the major shopping malls which line the area. I loved how simple the concept is. We felt safe throughout the check-in process. We loved the robots that delivered water to the room. It was my partner's birthday so it was a surprise when a robot delivered a birthday card for him. Absolutely would love to stay here again for a budget staycation in the Orchard area. Shop 'til you drop... into one of the rooms. Also, Komyuniti is a welcome surprise. Quiet ambiance. Great for a quiet date night. Kudos to the staff Vivian and those on their shift in early February... who were super friendly. Kudos to Yoshi and Yolanda, the robots... don't forget to thank them too.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5
78,5.0,I really like the adjustable bed and how comfortable it is. The view from the shower was nice too. Just that the aircon is not cold enough when we are sleeping and the swimming pool water is icy cold for me.,YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5
79,3.0,"With the floor to ceiling bathroom windows in their cabins, the shower experience at Yotel was probably the most memorable. Their cabins were very simple, functional and fulfil their brand promise of only focusing on providing the essentials. I slept well on their mattress. Though I have to say that service standards here are rather unremarkable. The purple lighting used around the property serves as quite a backdrop for the now necessary Instagram shot when on staycation. Check-in and out was quick and smooth without much hassle. Recommended if you are just looking for a self-sufficient, simple and value for money staycation experience in a time when leisure overseas travel is practically not possible.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

82,4.0,"For 3 guests, you couldn’t find a better hotel at this price for such a fantastic location. Right next door is the start of the shopping belt Orchard Road. However, bear in mind that the rooms are really small. The so-called room with a view is when you have to keep the toilet door opened then you are able to have a view. Once the toilet door is closed, it is really that’s it! A cabin! ",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

85,4.0,"This is the 2nd hotel in Orchard Road that i have tried in 2021 and is newer than the other one i have tried. Was given Room#2814. Despite room size is small, everything in the room is neat and tidy.  Given a nice city view in the toilet but don't forget to bring down the bind before you do your business. Room door is thick thus i did not hear any noise from the hotel corridor. Nice smart bed that you can adjust the angle while watching TV on bed. Water pressure from shower head is good but the only issue i have is the glass toilet door. If you are staying with another person you be able to see him/her sitting on toilet bowl, as the toilet door cannot be closed fully. There are gym and swimming pool at Level 10 but did not book any slot to try them.Did not opt for breakfast as there are many eateries within walking distance from the hotel.  Received a surprise msg from Yotel a day prior to check-in offering me complimentary early check-in. Took the 10am slot and check-in process was done within 5mins on Saturday. Overall enjoyed my short stay in Yotel, and i would recommend this hotel to traveller who prefer to spend most of the time out for sightseeing rather than staying in the room.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

I would recommend friends to try Yotel for a staycation.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5
88,5.0,My kids loved Yoshi and Yolanda very much. Only thing is that Yolanda sings a goodbye tune but Yoshi just say good bye. Thus its better to get the female robot to deliver items to the room. It was raining in the 3 days we stayed there thus the water in the swimming pool was cold. But that did not stop the kids from going into the pool when the rain stopped for a while. Overall the kids enjoyed themselves. ,YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5
89,4.0,"Room was small upon first impression but the futuristic interior design was thought through, having smartbeds/tv to utilizing space very well (that a full-length ironing board could fit in without cramming the place).Full bottles of shampoo/conditioner etc were surprisingly provided instead of your typical small samples, and the toilet was so clean and cosy w a view of the cityscape and hot water (don't worry you can pull the blinds down for privacy when taking a dump). YOSHI the robot was so cute and had a personality: It went, ""May the force be with you"" and ""Hasta La Vista, baby"". Didn't manage to meet YOLANDA though :(We had trouble trying to connect our device to the tv (it only streamed music and not videos??) so would be useful to have a thorough guide somewhere.Overall, we'd definitely come back and this experience is for people who are open to a concept-based room since roomspace is small.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

96,3.0,"I love the view, style and amenities of Yotel. Great location to access Orchard and train stations. When the hotel first opened the beds were in great condition, but recent visits shows the bed have sunken quite a bit. They missed out to replenish some amenities but were quick to recover after a call. As for their front liners, service seriously varies greatly from one another. The way they communicate COVID measures were not the most tactful. They have self-automated machines but at the end still require a staff to assist you or else end up diverting you to the counters, not a very smart check in after all.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5
97,2.0,"My husband and I booked a 3d2n stay to celebrate the New Year countdown to 2021. The room was very clean and I really liked the retractable bed. We had a high floor hence we had a good view of the orchard area surroundings. However, I think the design of the room is very bad/not soundproof as I could hear water flushing down the pipe whenever the guests above uses the toilet/bathe. It happened in the day and we thought nothing of it. However, we didn’t realised how loud it was that we got awaken up at 3am by the water flowing through the pipes and it lasted about an hour! (Like who bathes at 3am?!) We called the guest services and the technician came down to explain they couldn’t do anything about it but thankfully enough they allowed us to have a late checkout since it disrupted our sleep. The bfast “buffet” was bad as it was only a one time selection of breakfast which consists of just 2 mini pastry, 2 slices of bread, a small meiji yoghurt, and either a sandwich or a few pieces of dimsum. Not exactly worth it to wake up early for. And for guests who expect the usual buffet spreads like omelette or noodles, you may not find it here. This is probably due to Covid but selection of food spread could be improved and probably have a staggered timing as there were a long queue forming when I collected my breakfast.Other than the nice polite service staffs and clean rooms, I don’t think I will book a stay here again.",YOTEL Singapore Hotel,4.5

It would be great if they included a small guide on how to connect.There is a nespresso machine for coffeeholics like myself. The shower and bathtub are separate and it is great. Water pressure and rain shower are OK. Bathtub cleanliness could be improved further. There are 2 toilet bowls I’m not really sure why. I stayed at the signature Marina Bay room and enjoyed the view of blue sky and MBS. There is also a room balcony that you can go out to take pictures. Do note if you didn’t lock the balcony, aircon will turn off. Aircon can be controlled from 20-25 degrees celcius. Top floors and rooftop swimming pool seem to be still under renovation. Gym has a variety of equipment. Inner Decoration is garden oasis, quite nice. Location is in Marina Square so you can go shopping and chill and eat as well. Peppermint restaurant breakfast is local, just wondering why as we go staycation we prefer to eat seasonal specialty from other countries and other local food(again). Dinner was full due to Ramadan. Do check for happy hour at the atrium lounge if you like to drink. Overall, Prem and Doris were very attentive, polite for left and helpful in resolving my issues, malign sure that the staycation was great. Thank you for your great hospitality.

10,1.0,"Is a birthday staycation for my hubby and kids but things doesn’t goes well at all. 1. Check in waited for awhile coz priority was given to those people who wanted to check out. After we check in they informed us they are having a soft launch. ( for this I still can accept even though they should email us way before our check in date which we book this at least 3 month ago)2. After we went in to our room, the room is nice. Kids wanted to soak in the bath tub. The moment I went in the bathroom, i saw hairs in the bath tub but the best part is along the ream of the tub there is tissue wrap with hair laying at the corner of the tub ( that really gross me up) so I tell myself is okie as long as I don’t use the bathtub it will be fine. Even though the 2nd day I ask for housekeeping the hair and tissue is still there. They just empty the dustbin the made the bed.3. Here come the swimming pool. I’m surprised when we walk to the pool there is no staff to check the timing. Then whoever go in there who knows they have book for the swimming pool. So what is the purpose of booking the timing. Defeat the purpose of doing that.4. 1st Night comes, around midnight aircon start to stop and I wake up the whole night just to on the aircon in order to to let my kids sleep better if not the whole room is going to be stuffy.5. The 2nd night comes again( which is the last night of the stay) I approach the counter and told them what happened to the room aircon which I expected or hopefully they will send us a technician to check on the aircon for us. First thing she did apologise then she ask us to try it again one more night which we only stay there for 3d2n. We went back to our room same thing happened all over again.6. Next day I checked out early morning ( can’t wait to go home to enjoy my own aircon without any hassle) as usual they will ask us how was the stay? I told them what happened. The only things they do is to say ( oh I’m so sorry to hear that) then they just proceed to check us out QUICKLY.Lastly but surely I have a small issue that about the concierge. I ask for a carpark coupon during the stay but I was told by them that the coupon is only valid for 30min once we collected it from them. Im curious and stunt. Is there such things going on?That’s is my whole 3d2n super horrific and terrible experience from ParkRoyal collection Marine Bay.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

12,5.0,"We held our wedding banquet at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay in Mar 2021. The exceptional service that was delivered by the hotel staff allowed us to enjoy ourselves largely stress-free throughout this entire process. The Garden Ballroom is definitely one of the most modern and beautiful ballroom in Singapore as of now after the major facelift that was completed at the start of 2021. In addition, food was delicious and the portion was huge. The team that was led by the experienced Banquet Manager, Kelvin, and proficient AV Lead, Tarmizi, ensured that everything was executed smoothly and on point during the banquet. Last but not least, the impeccable service that was provided by Assistant Catering Sales Manager, Xina, was highly commendable. She ensured that the transition due to the change in ownership of hotel in early 2020, and the planning and execution of the banquet during this COVID-19 period were as seamless as they could get. She was also very professional and knew her stuff well (e.g. safe management measures and regulations for wedding receptions). Despite the additional workload due to COVID-19 (e.g. massive rescheduling of banquets and revision of contracts, enforcing safe management measures, etc.), she was extremely prompt at assisting us in our planning and answering to our queries. She had never said no upfront to our requests, and she genuinely tried her best to accede to them. We could tell that this was all made possible through her positive attitude and hard work to the extent of staying up late, and by going the extra mile for her clients.When we signed the wedding banquet package in mid-2019 (when the hotel was still known as Marina Mandarin), she assured us that we will be in her good hands. She had definitely delivered beyond what she had promised, and exceeded our expectations on all fronts.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

16,3.0,"Big difference from the previously Marina Mandarin Hotel. Interior at the reception was amazing. Beautiful... Garden in a Hotel.Staff were very friendly. Queue was pretty long at check-in but i was glad that there were 6 staff handling the process and beverages were offered to guests in the queue.Fitness Centre was chic. Love the concept. The machines were among the latest, very user friendly. Room was chic. Quite modern and pleasing to the eyes. The closet and minibar very nicely hidden. The shower cubicle was a bit too small. It fits 1 person. Bathtub was pretty shallow but was good. There is a water dispenser beside the tap. Great idea but.. you can't fill up your bottle or the one provided in the room because, the dispenser was short. You can use the glasses provided on top of the minibar.The coffee table in the room was nice. However, the chair was super uncomfortable. There is no work or business table / chair so the same chair had to be carried to the TV console to do work. Very uncomfortable. I am short at 1.63m in height and i guess someone taller might be in a worse state.Air-con was great. Can be controlled and stayed at the desired climate.Wifi was good.The power plug by the bed was not working. The power from the USB port at the same point was pretty slow. I waa lucky that i brought my travel charger and charged my mobile at the tv console area.Balcony was great by no shelter so it does get wet when it rained.TV channels were... so-so. I was quite surprised at the number of channels. Not impressed.I looked through the in-room dining as i wanted to get some cakes. No desserts in the menu.Overall, i thought more could have been expected for the price the hotel charges. I get more for the same price at a nearby premise.

22,4.0,"We last stayed here in 2014, I remember it looked dated even back then so this revamp is very much needed.The atrium on the 4th floor is beautiful, certainly evokes a feeling of calmness and tranquility compared to the concrete jungle just outside the doors. Check in was fast and effortless, we bought our package on KLOOK with our SGRV which came with a room upgrade and 2pm check-out. As we needed 2 rooms, we got 2 adjoining rooms on the 14th floor, with a view of the Fountain of Wealth and the Marina Reservoir off to the side. Rooms are newly furbished, with laminate flooring and a modern look. Functional and neat. Our rooms also had a little daybed and the balcony is accessible. The bathroom has a tub, separate standing shower, a bidet seat and an old timey bidet washbasin (why??). No bottled water but each room came with glass bottles that you can refill from the filtered water tap in the bathroom. Also included is a care pack with 2 pcs of disposable masks, alcohol wipes and hand sanitizer.The hotel is still undergoing renovation. The area leading to the pool still has hoarding, and access from the carpark or Marina Square shopping center is not straightforward (don’t follow the signages in the mall). We also heard some drilling and knocking on Sat afternoon.If you are light sleepers, Temasek Boulevard is popular with speedsters who want to show off their engines. Daytime traffic noise is barely discernible but at night we could hear the roaring engines quite clearly.There are 3 seatings for breakfast at Peppermint. As we are early risers, we booked the 7am session. We requested to be seated in the pavilions but was directed inside. Scanned the QR code for the menu but orders were still being taken F2F by wait staff with pen and paper. Personally, the food was nothing to write about. Standard fare, ala carte buffet style. Service was busy but efficient. They could have been more regular with the drinks. The restaurant interior is beautiful and we took a walk through their rooftop vegetable garden.When we left the restaurant at 8+am, there was a queue about 15-20 pax waiting to be seated. And there were people who got to sit in the pavilions. Maybe they ordered ala carte or made reservations earlier. The gym has a fair range of equipment but it definitely needs a larger dustbin. When we were there, there were children eating snacks inside. The pool itself is not bad, ranging from 0.8-1.2m in depth. Pool towels are available and there was enough space and depth for a decent swim. Due to the construction, there is no view. Booking of facilities like the gym and pool are done through scanning the QR code in the room.Overall, it was a simple, no frills staycation. Looking forward to when the hotel completes its renovations. ","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

This was the case even so for our guests during the wedding!The food here is really good as well. Many of our guests told us that the menu was very creative and absolutely delicious. Totally not what they expected from a hotel reception. The hotel was recently renovated as well so the overall aesthetic is very modern and akin to an indoor garden.

We received a  lot of complements from our guest regarding the food. The bridal suite was clean and spacious. The Atrium Ballroom was also just the right size for our 100 pax dinner.

Best part is the toilets had bidets so yeah, major plus points. The only thing that we missed out is that we did not get the chance to use the pools coz it was already fully booked when we checked in. So yeah, can just imagine the disappointment on my kids' faces. We did not take breakfast at the hotel coz the hotel is surrounded by malls and there are restaurants nearby too.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

Will definitely come the third time.Truelly recommended.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0
29,5.0,"My review will be split to 2 parts. Firstly, the stay at the hotel and secondly, the wedding experience.-Stay at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay-The hotel is newly renovated at our time of visit. The urban rooms were nice and cosy and we had an unblocked view of MBS. The amenities provided in the room was sufficient and most of the housekeeping/ room service requests can be done via a QR Code by the bedside. The bridal suite was equally good and equipped with 2 bathrooms, one in the main bedroom (with bathtub) and another in the living room area (no bathtub). Only feedback is that the wardrobe is too small for the amount of attires we had (3x wedding dress + 1 gua). Sunlight was good for make up. There were bird cages hung along the walkway on level 4 with real birds chirping, just a small detail which really added to the atmosphere and theme of the hotel.There was an issue with the VIP Parking. Apparently some of the VIP lots belongs to the club beside the hotel, leaving limited lots. Although we were allocated 2 VIP lots, all the lots were full when we came back from running errands and had to park at the roadside (within the compound but not in a proper parking space) until a lot was available. However they did offer valet service and would deliver the keys to your room once done. -The Wedding Experience-My wife and I held our wedding in the newly renovated Atrium Ballroom on 19th March 2021. The ballroom is nice and spacious with a huge LED screen at the stage area and two large TVs at the sides to display your videos/ photos montages. The reception area immediately outside the ballroom is nice. Although it's a bit dark, it was easily solved by the spotlights provided by the staff.The food was amazing and we received only positive feedback from our guests regarding the food especially the chicken satay lollipop and golden mantou with chilli crab sauce. The wedding team was well organised and very on the ball during the banquet. I am impressed by the team's co-ordination and execution.Thank you wedding team, especially Fiona and Kelvin. You guys were very professional, accommodating and prompt with your replies. The dinner would not have been a success without you. Recommendation:1. Put room number on access cards especially for bridal suites (or distinguish the card for bridal suites) so it does not get mixed up with other room cards as bridesmaids and groomsmen will be going around the rooms to run errands2. Allocate a preparation room on the same level for wedding entourage so we do not have to go up and down  (plus we stay different floors so have to trial and error the many various room cards to tap in the lift and room door. It's quite messy on the day and post wedding).","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0
30,4.0,"Organised  a family staycation for the children. The hotel recently opened in Dec 2020 and parts of the hotel was still under renovation. The parking leading up to the carpark was partly closed so the initial track up to the hotel was quite challenging. However, the concierge staff was kind enough to let us park in front of the hotel for the duration of our stay. The room was very new and recently renovation. But the beds were really single size. so it was quite a squeeze for the 4 of us and then I had asked for an extra bed in the end which proved very helpful for my quality of sleep. Service staff was also really helpful and prompt answering the call and attending to our needs. Overall, it was quite a positive experience and would recommend the hotel once the renovations are completely done.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0
31,3.0,"The newly renovated atrium was nice with the garden setting. It gave sense of place and welcoming. However, management and maintenance side I think require more attention for improvement:1. Upon check-in , we appreciate to let us have early check-in. But when we asked to give us the nicest room upon the room category that we booked, ended up to our dismay , the room given was totally not yet tidied up and seems like just left by previous guest. Isn’t during this Covid period they should alternate the guest’s stay? Also we checked the room view and it is not the Marina bay view that we have booked. So-call Marina bay view is you need to go to the corner or out to balcony then can see Marina bay view. Totally deviate from the photo shown in website for this particular room category 2. After the bad impression, we emphasized again to change to room with best direct view to Marina as shown in website. Duty manager changed for us to another room, not really to our expectation, the room again not directly facing Marina bay as per the website photo shown. We need to stand near the window at one side then only can see the “direct” Marina bay view. We called duty manager again but he said that is the best room with the view already. Sigh ...3. Aside from these, we found the room window glass  was not clean and have quite a few patches of  finger prints, drinking glass having stains and the handle of coffee machine was with oily stain. Need to call the house keeping staff to clean. 4. For the pool, you only can call to make reservations after check-in. Since we early checked-in, it is hard to believe the swimming pool slots left only at the evening  and night time. We quickly checked also the next day the pool slot either left only 6 am or 12 noon which at check out time! We checked-in  in Monday and it should not be peak timing! Called duty manager and he simply explained due to school holiday and people extended stay so have booked most the slots.. sigh again we was not  convinced by the explanation. And we tried to check during the next day morning whether was really peak time for the pool, to our surprise actually the pool was under maintenance from 9am to 12noon. If the pool not ready then please do not use the excuse like peak period and already booked by others guest already. They should inform in advanced prior to our check-in.The whole above experienced was time wasted and felt like we being “fooled”. Nevertheless, we did appreciate they allowed early check in and late check out since they  tried to compensate us the pool time during check out time at noon. Also we managed to use the dining credits for two lunches and one dining . I must said the food for the restaurants are nice. Especially the Peppermint Restaurant, the buffet dinner food were very fresh. Thumbs up for that and we also enjoyed their ala carte lunch the next day with free prawn crackers. Thumbs up for Peppermint Restaurant. ","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

Due to covid, the hotel also opened the ballroom to cater for breakfast guests.

43,4.0,"Parkroyal collection Marina Bay is still going through some renovation with a little hammering, drilling and fumes of glue on the upper floors. If you are not sensitive to those, then go ahead to book your staycation now with its current low rates. We did request for a change of room and the noise did subside. The design of the lobby garden in the hotel’ is beautiful with real chirping birds and the sculpture of wind chimes waves hanging at the lobby as a feature is indeed charming. But again if you are sensitive to noise, then you maybe disturbed by it as the birds sing as early as 8am.....Or charmed by it by waking you up gently...Combined with the lobby music, it tend to become quite loud. Not for everyone but it is certainly unique. I am told the pool is a mineral pool but it is still heavily hoarded up with renovation happening at the restaurant nearby. Not great. The cleaner in the changing room gave me stares when I walked in with dust coming from the pool. He is obviously upset as he is doing a fantastic job in up-keeping the cleanliness. The gym is quite impressive with state of the art latest equipment. As soon as the renovation is done, this hotel will be something. Note to hotel: the room door bell is too soft and almost non-existent. What is the role of the angmoh trainer at the gym? Training? Cleaning? Because he left when I am working out and came back only when I left. I do not have a chance to check with him on the new complex equipment there. If that is the case of not infecting guest with safe distancing, then you may be better off with a local cleaner. ","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

It was an absolute delight and joy to have stayed at ParkRoyal Marina Bay on 20th – 22nd Feb 2021.As we had a wedding to attend at the Singapore Flyer, ParkRoyal Marina Bay was the first hotel we thought of, due to the convenience. The check-in process was very smooth and we were assisted by Mr Prem who was on duty that Saturday afternoon.Mr Prem was very courteous and helpful. He even upgraded the room for us, from Urban to Lifestyle King, Room 1237, offered a late check out and even went the extra mile to give us a courtesy call to make sure that the room we stayed in was spacious and that the view was gorgeous. Indeed it was!We applaud Mr Prem for his attentiveness and professionalism and every staff member with whom we came in contact with was kind and approachable too! All ParkRoyal Marina Bay’s staff is very helpful and we can see their sincerity too. Starting from the bellboy, concierge staff all the way to housekeeping staff. We’re appreciative of how ParkRoyal Marina Bay treat their guests as family. I must say, our 3 days and 2 nights there was amazing. We loved the ambience, how peaceful and clean the hotel is and how convenient it is to nearby shopping malls.

52,4.0,"stayed two nights here during Valentine's Day. previously known as Marina Mandarin, the hotel underwent reno works and now has a garden themed architecture in its lobby atrium. that alone is worth the visit and there are interesting perspectives to look at from different angles. our room was huge and spacious, decor stylish and cosy. however, the bathroom has not undergone reno yet and thus maintains an old school feel. the shower head connected to the tub was leaking water at the sides and we had to inform the recep to send someone to fix. the hinges of the bathroom door were rusty and old. if you are looking for a pool staycay, then most likely you'll be disappointed. i had set my expectations of the pool low prior to the stay after seeing some photos online. the pool area is pretty run down, some of the sun beds stained and there's not much of an ambience to begin with. the view of the skyscrapers in the vicinity are mostly obstructed too. on a positive note, they will be refurbishing the area and should complete by Jun/ Jul this year.from time to time, you can hear some slight noise disturbances from the room due to the ongoing reno works but that is still bearable. at night, the hotel is very quiet and peaceful. overall, we definitely enjoyed our stay at Park Royal and managed to spend quality time together during our 2 nights there. if you are looking for a unique hotel experience and not nitty gritty with its imperfections then you should give it a try!i would also like to compliment Kimmy from the reception for her friendly and approachable disposition and great service! looking forward to our next stay at Park Royal Collection again.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

55,5.0,"Stayed at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay over the Chinese New Year long weekend with my family of 7 which included my aged parents. Requested for connecting rooms which was acceded to and checking in was a breeze. This is my second stay here after my short staycay honeymoon with my wife on her birthday in Dec 2020. As expected, the rooms were clean and spacious. The bed and pillows were just right for us, offering great comfort. We just love the day bed in the lifestyle rooms, looking out to the balcony which overlook the Suntec City skyline. It is long enough for a 1.8m man to sleep on.The hotel also does not hold back in satisfying its guests. When we noticed the nespresso capsules were lesser than the last time we came, we just gave a call through the one connect number at the phone. Soon enough, a Nespresso staff came over to ask if we needed help with the machine. When we told him that the capsules were not refilled, he explained that they now only put 1 of each kind and we can call them for more capsules if we needed them. That's great as not many guests may use them and those who do, need not face with stale capsules.I also asked for late checkout during the check-in but was told this was subject to the hotel's occupancy on my day of check out. During one of the days, I chatted with a concierge staff, Mr Alfyro Ozaer and shared about my request for late checkout as I had to attend to some matter in the morning of the check out day. He assured me he will assist and true enough, on the evening of the day of my checkout, I bumped into him and he confirmed with me that the request for late checkout for both rooms has been arranged. I am very thankful for the arrangement.I will definitely stay here again for the clean room, friendly staff and convenient location for many heritage walkabouts around the area!","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

80,5.0,"Firstly, we are appreciative towards ParkRoyal for their generous “thank you” offer in rewarding Singapore healthcare worker with free complimentary stays. Being fortunate to receive it, we’ll like to thank you for the lovely stay.ReviewAlthough the hotel isn’t eye catching from the exterior, upon entering, one is greeted with a spacious grand atrium that is accented with lots of greens, wood and natural light. Taking the stunning glass elevators to our floor, you get to take it the beautiful, enclosed paradise-like spirit of the atrium.The room is simple yet elegant. All the furnishings seem fresh (newly renovated) with a charming balcony that has a picturesque view of the city. Being honest, the main highlight of the room was the bed. I have stayed in many hotels through my travels but never have a bed felt so comfortable. The moment I checked in and laid on it at 2pm, I ended up sleeping till 7pm. (Could also be from the long hours working nights in the hospital recently). The most innovative part of the hotel will have to be the integrated hotel chatbot assistant. Ordering in-room services, booking of facilities, checking in-house restaurants etc. All of these could be done effortlessly in the chatbot app.There is a lot to write about especially the gym, swimming pool, the delicious food in the Peppermint restaurant etc but for the sake of concision, I will have to end with the most important factor that makes or breaks a hotel. The staff.The hotel, restaurant and concierge staffs were incredibly professional. Well dressed and courteous, their hospitality exceeds SIA’s “for looks only” stewardesses and it is what I feel makes the hotel such a delight to stay in. A short story, as we were checking out, concierge and security staffs, Ravi and Hussein, had a lovely chat with us. As we were pushing our luggage out to the carpark, they called another staff to assist us. The luggage was light having only one day worth of clothes, so we naturally refused the help. They were adamant and refused our No, saying that he needs to escort us down to the carpark so we could “leave in style”. This was just one of the many lovely encounters with the hotel staffs.If I could give some areas to improve on, It will the “capped volume” of the Chromecast TV feature and the lack of sun shading umbrellas for the seats by the pool. Overall, I had an awesome stay with ParkRoyal and I’m dying to plan another stay with them in the future.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

But to my disappointment, I receive a call back from them and they said that their housekeeping claims that they DIDN’T SEE and jeans hanging in the wardrobe while they were clearing the room. Its really unbelievable how can they claim that they do not see it when i clearly remember that i hang it in the wardrobe and its not even a week after my checkout that i called and enquired.

In the room, I loved the cupboard design, awesome views with the balcony of the bay, full transparent panels facing the balcony allowing full view outside from inside, lots of huge full length mirror in the room. Customer service was great, reception was welcoming and friendly. She addressed my requests that I had on my reservation and explained most of the things well. Restaurant staff at breakfast was also friendly. Tv was big and great. QR codes and chatbot for booking of facilities was easy to use. Loved the filtered water tap.Can be improvedRoom had some empty space that could be filled up with either a sofa or a table. Though the sg clean label was hanged on the door, housekeeping can be improved. When I first entered, room floor was dusty, corners of the bathtub had some dirt and tub was not wiped dry. Inner white walls of balcony paint was already dirty, could review and feedback to the design team and contractors regarding type of paint or darker colour since renovations are still ongoing on the upper floors. Tried chromecast for the tv and it was not working. Pool area was plain and felt disengaged from the garden vibe of the hotel, adding more green pieces would help. A jacuzzi pool would be nice.

86,5.0,"*5-star stay at the newly renovated Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay*Was looking forward to the staycation at Parkroyal Marina Bay as it was recently rebranded from Marina Mandarin, with newly renovated lobby, restaurant and rooms. The stay was absolutely lovely. Room is fresh-smelling and clean, and love the non-carpeted floor now as it seems much cleaner than carpets. Room is well equipped with all the necessary amenities, if you need extra items (and to book pool/gym slots) you will just need to scan the QR code on the night stand. Service was wonderful throughout the hotel. Thank you Kimmy, Hailey from Front Office and also Bowie from Peach Blossoms (Chinese restaurant). We had an awesome dinner at Peach Blossoms, quality Cantonese cuisine and wonderful service. Very quick in-room service too - and when we asked for wine glasses and ice to chill wine, they're the first hotel that we've experience that gives ice+water, which makes wine-chilling so much easier. Excellent service to anticipate guest needs! Breakfast was very good as well. Experienced a short queue upon arriving the restaurant but that's because all the guests came at the same time. We were quickly ushered to our seats within 2 mins. Alvin was an excellent host and explained the breakfast process. We could also see staff from administration departments helping out (people in black jackets I'm guessing?). Really great teamwork from everybody. Great job to the hotel team, highly recommended for Singaporeans to have a staycation here soon!As much as it was wonderful for us as a couple staycation, the next day business lunch at peppermint restaurant ala carte buffet was a little disappointing as the restaurant was abit short staffed (understandable during this period) and food delivery to the tables slow. Restaurant also ran out of my client's favorite nonya kueh and didn't have jasmine green tea. Hopefully they will improve over the next few weeks.All in all a great stay and highly recommended.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

Don't think they actually renovated the toilet. there were also some bugs (not alot) on the floor. i don't know what bug that was but i reckoned it's from the wood. Would i recommend the hotel?

We called back, and managed to contact Jackie from the restaurant. Personally, I am really heartened by Jackie’s quick and reassuring responses. She helped look for the wallet and got back to us double quick time (it was already late and probably near to the close of business for the day; if not past her working hours). She even offered to arrange for a team member to send the wallet to our residence, which we declined trying not to impose too much of a hassle to the team (instead we opted to collect on the next working day). Alvin from the restaurant also helped a lot. Thanks to him too!On next day, I linked up with Peter, who is the security executive. He helped safe-keep the wallet overnight. Very happy to see him and grateful for his help!In all, I feel that Jackie, Alvin, Peter and team are responsible and helpful. Definitely, commendable team from the restaurant and the hotel.Food at the restaurant was great too. We placed orders using an app and the delivery of food was quick, even during the peak period. The personnel were generally friendly too!To be fair and to bring a balanced view, there were some minor lapses, such as the restaurant not being able to find our reservation record. Also, the staff at the entrance was a tad slow to bring us in to our seats (no one was stationed at the entrance at our point of arrival for approximately 10mins). All in all, we suspect that it may due to the restaurant being understaffed, and december is no doubt one of the busiest period of time.Especially so, this whole incident showed that despite the challenges, most of the ground staff are trying their best to overcome these limitations. Again, grateful for Jackie, Alvin and Peter (and team who had helped us behind the scenes but we did not manage to get their names). :)","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Singapore Hotel",4.0

The staff was quite attentive and explained to me that they need to clear the check out guests so that there will be rooms for check in guest. When my child got cranky, they offered me a room instead of having to wait till check in time. Grateful for that... kids were often given snacks and we also got a nice xmas biscuits.Rooms were spacious to fit 3 adults and 2 kids. We had to request for an extra bed cos the twin beds were not available and that’s an additional cost of $80 per night. Wished they could be more accommodating to families it’s like everything extra u need is chargeable... No late check out as well, not even 1pm. When you call the operator you will be put on hold for awhile. There’s no connection to Marina Square yet. If it rains, you need to walk via the carpark. Take the escalator down from Burger King.

There is a filter tap and more wood and glasses in the room. Excepting for guests walking on the rooms above you on the laminated floorboards which can get to you sometimes. Probably I got someone heavy up above me.Gone are the booklet for room service and other services in the hotel. It’s QR code all the way. Cool!One thing irks me. With all these gadgets you lose the human touch. Not all is lost it’s take a few minutes to tap in your housekeeping requirements or any other needs. The response is immediate, suppose AI responding to our queries. But execution  could be better. Like I requested for body cleanser that’s your shower gel tube. It didn’t come. Got to call the operator and in a few minutes the required item came in a jiffy.The concierge staff were attentive and were always there to assist you in the directions to take to navigate Suntec Millenia Walk and next door Marina Sq.

I had also stayed at the nearby Pan Pacific a few times, and always enjoyed my stay there. I was keen to see how the newly renovated hotel is going to look like. I’m not disappointed at all . Checkin was smooth. I was allowed an early checkin . The lobby, which was my fav part of the hotel during the marina mandarin days, is now even mote stunning. The greeneries that surrounds the lobby is just beautiful. The room is simple and along the trend of the Parkroyal Pickering. Lots of natural light and simplistic in design. I like it. Renovation is still on going in some parts of the hotel. But I never felt disturbed by that. Service at concierge was very attentive and friendly . Service at the Atrium bar and checkin is not bad , but you just felt they are still ironing out some hiccups and things should get better as they start to really get back into the swing of things.

The room light switch is not a dimmer switch, hence you cannot control the light brightness.If you switch off the light, the room would be dark to watch the TV. Due to Covid-19, going to the Gym need to made booking, I called the reception to make a booking and was told gym was full, so I need to wait for 1hr.I agreed, but I went down to 5 floor to take a look at the gym. No one was in the Gym !!! In the toilet, there is a bidet bowl. while I was using it, I turn on the tap, yellowish water came out for few second then the comes the clean running water. This makes me think, did the chamber maid clean the bidet bowl? There are some TV channel one of my favorite is History, but it was ""hang"" I can't watch at all. I have to watch other channel.This hotel was Marina Mandarin, in the past the room was carpeted flooring.

The hotel did not allow us to go up to the room because we had 3 adults and 2 kids (2 years old and 8 months old). Please note that we were told that we can have 3 adults and 2 kids in the room. They made them stood in the lobby waiting for the manager to come over to resolve this issue. They had to wait there with the kids who were very tired at that point. And even after 3 managers came the issue was not resolved. On the second day, they did not allow the kids to go up to the room in the afternoon for a nap coz apparently they were not registered. But somehow on the first day they had no issue. I have no idea what the hotel staff is doing. Anyone with young kids would know how frustrating this would be.

6,2.0,"The recent COVID pandemic has given a chance to try out several hotels in Singapore for staycaytion and a short getaway from the hectic worklife. After staying in 70% of the hotels that are opened in Singapore during this pandemic, I conclude that Marina Bay Sands is one of the worst hotel offering below par service standards, rude and impatient staffs.Staffs were rude, impatient during check-ins, giving attitude and do not display any form of professionalism while they are carrying the branding of MBS. We were rejected entry at the lift lobbies as our friend swapped our key card by mistake, and we were horrified by the attitude of the staff stationed there. Instead of initiating a help to check with his/her supervisor or the staff who managed our check in, she directly rejected our entry and kept shaking her head, denying our entry. WE PAID FOR THE ROOM and you are telling us we can't enter? Instead of wasting our time (which we have wasted 45mins at the slow check in counter), we would appreciate a kind gesture to help us check on the issue, rather than a direct and insistent deny for our entry. The issue was only resolved when I decided to stop wasting time and proceeded to check with the staff that checked us in, when we knew we swapped our key cards as mistake.I was absolutely disgusted by this service standard and it had spoilt my entire experience at MBS. Please look into training your staffs basic customer service skills.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

We were happy with the service provided starting from Guest Service Officer Chihiro, she made us felt welcome upon arrival. I would like to commend the service provided by the housekeeping and express service team as they are prompt in delivering our request comparing to the other hotels we had booked previously.We stayed in Tower 2 L31, so far I can say the best among 3 towers as it have direct access to the Gym and nice pool access. As borders are still closed a getaway to MBS is definitely recommend!","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

9,5.0,"My friend,who is a regular hotel guest at MBS,recommended me to upgrade to Club 55 for a memorable staycation at MBS.The Club 55 upgrade comes with exclusive priviledges and complimentary  amenities including breakfast,afternoon tea and evening beverages and canapes for two persons.The lunch menu was not much to write about. The dinner menu was more substantive. If you enjoy alcoholic drinks in a good setting,you will enjoy Club 55. Club 55 is the main venu for the lunch and dinner treats. If the place is full when you arrive,there are alternative venues to enjoy same food.The view on Level 55 is fantastic. Add the ambience and perfect service,one will feel the cost of upgrading to Club 55 is money well spent for all the ""extras""Go for Club 55 the next time you stay at MBS.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
10,5.0,"I would like to commend the staff of MBS for a very approachable attitude. Starting from the check in, the staff gave us an electronic queue number that we can check online so we don't need to wait in line. I find it very strategic and modern. When we reached our room, we are in awe of the room's ambiance and the view in the balcony is magnificent! The room is very clean and smells nice as well. Few minutes after we reached our room, the room services knocked to deliver our extra mattress. When I examine the room I found this awesome toilet. It's very huge! We just noticed one thing, the downside is, there is no bidet present in the toilet so it's quiet hard to you know, wash after you use the toilet. I hope the management would consider adding bidet inside the toilets considering it is a must and also the hotel is a 5 star hotel without bidet. Nevertheless, we had a great dinner at Lavo, The staff there are very approachable. In the morning we did a morning exercise in the gym. The gym equipment are high-end. After we hit the gym, we planned to go for a swim but it is quiet hard to make a reservation for the pool so we had to wait for a while and wish for our luck to get a slot for the pool. Sad thing is, we can only use the pool for an hour. By the way, there is a store beside the pool and I would like to commend Ms. Lina for assisting us in buying our stuffs. She is very approachable and hands on to guests. I would like to go back again and have a stay in Marina Bay Sands, despite the minor downside, I still had an Excellent experience in Marina Bay.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
11,5.0,"stayed in MBS for 4 days — everything was great and there weren't many minus points at all! check in was great — sms booking slots, so smooth. managed to get a check in slot at 9am, and went in to my room IMMEDIATELY. I had this fear I was gonna wait till 3pm to get in my room. But thankfully it was ready. all these are thanks to Guest Check In officer - Nikkie. she is so sweet, accommodating and detailed. Rooms — got a room on the 36th floor, garden view was splendid. Was already looking forward to the morning sunrises  had a deep soaking tub which I heavily utilized for my relaxation. Thank god TV had screen mirroring and bluetooth function. Housekeeping — Special thanks to Xi Mei, for her friendliness and for attending to us all four days. She decorated my room with rose petals in the tub, although I wasnt there for a honeymoon, it's the little things that makes one enjoy even more! Thank you Xi Mei for your great hospitality.Concierge — special thanks to Brandon and Lavisha, for attending to my added guests for check in and visiting, their hospitality makes us feel more welcomed. Not awkward, although there were strict rules imposed due to covid-19, they ensured us smoothly and sweetly rather than giving us the ""no can't do"" attitude, which many places tend to do.Infinity Pool — managed to book morning slots for an early morning sunrise swim. Great thanks to Andy for being a fun-loving lifeguard. Swim times are limited to an hour, but it's great due to Covid-19 restrictions.Breakfasts @ Rise — served by Chloe, Edvick, Peter and many more whom I didn't manage to get their names. But they are really accommodating on our requests and orders. Overall, the stay was great. I would definitely come back for a stay again. Hopefully soon!!!! ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
12,5.0,"Due to Covid19 travel restrictions,i was only left with the option for a staycation as a honeymoon option. its definitely a perfect choice !let's start with check-in ; we were given timeslots (to reply via sms). we came a lil earlier than our timeslot but since it was not crowded,we managed to get our rooms in 15mins. i indicates in my booking that i was there for a honeymoon. at the last min,i asked if there were smoking rooms as we were assigned a non-smoking room. the staff was so sweet to accomodate to us by giving an upgrade and also smoking room.we had the sky view room and the view is GORGEOUS & breathtaking,making us wanna stay in the room throughout. the room is also super spacious ! minibar was complimentary,and toiletries are top-notch ones.  overall,definitely a wonderful stay !","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

So we walk to tower 1 to check in and they told us visitor cannot check in anymore even we are same family. WTH, Feeling unwelcome with their 5* hotel stupid rules... spoiled our holiday mood. Will not visit anymore!","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
14,4.0,"Pretty good experience - room was spacious and comfortable, service was good, and of course the views from the top were great.Only drawback was that this place is really busy. Feels very crowded in all the public areas. Would not be my ideal kind of place if I wanted somewhere relaxing for a weekend of peace.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
15,1.0,"From the start, it’s a disaster. My friend walked into the hotel with 2 toddlers, carrying a bag, large parcel and a cake, and although there were concierge staff standing around, I must conclude they must be visually challenged; as no one offered to assist.The check-in process is designed to make guests feel as unwelcome as possible.Take a number to check-in like you would at an emergency room, wait around like idiots waiting to be called. Check in is slow and tedious, lacking in information unless we ask for it. 2 main guests and only up to 3 visitors. Only 2 guests can stay overnite: kind of like I’m a hospital. Check in staff,Devi, refused to register our guests in during the check in process and just told us to proceed to the lifts with our keycards. When we got to the lifts, we were stopped like criminals and questioned. We were then directed to yet another counter to register our guests which took up another 20 mins just to put in names. After registering, we went to the lifts and was yet again interrogated before allowing to be let into the lobby, same process when leaving the room, exiting the lift lobby. The entire demented process just to get into our rooms took at least 1.5 hours! Is the staff that incompetent? Or who is the fool to come up with this system?? This has nothing to do with Covid rules as other established 5 star hotels do not make their guests feel so unwelcome! Seems like at MBS, unless you are a gambler or a high-roller, they do not want you there. As far as MBS is concerned, they want you to take their business somewhere else, which is exactly what I’ll be doing henceforth. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
16,5.0,"This iconic hotel sets the standard for luxury amongst Singaporean hotels. It’s where the city’s young and beautiful head after hours for classy cocktails, fine dining and gambling. Of course, plenty of tourists visit too, for the world-famous observation deck which affords stunning views of the Lion City.My room at Marina Bay Sands was huge and modern, with incredible views of the bay and the Shoppes. The bed was huge and the bathroom had a huge standalone tub that I just couldn’t wait to get in after a day of exploring the hot and humid city! The property’s pool is really something else; in fact, I believe it’s the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool. Not too shabby! Before you check in, you should note that guests are only allowed one hour of pool access per day. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed to learn this at first (the views are so amazing that you’ll never want to leave) but the policy actually makes a lot of sense. Otherwise, it would be packed with guests 24/7, which would spoil the special experience. As it was, the pool was quiet and I got to enjoy it without being jostled and splashed nonstop. Overall, Marina Bay Sands provides guests with a top shelf luxury experience. I was worried that the property might rely on its incredible views and iconic status and thus slack off on service, but not so. The staff couldn’t do enough to help and make my stay at Marina Bay Sands a totally unforgettable one.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
17,1.0,"I’m not the type to complain ever, but this whole trip, from start to finish, has been a disaster. Apparently I’m allergic to MBS because it has been a train wreck.I feel awful for the staff because they are wonderful, but their product is worse than any hotel I’ve ever been in.1) Initial booking- I spent over an hour waiting for their email that would allow me to book our pool stay and our check in time. I called after 20 min saying I had no email even though I had a booking confirmation number. They told me to wait. Called after an hour, they finally rebooked because there was “a problem” with their booking system. Great.2) They gave us an upgrade at check in from a grand club to their orchid suite (single step upgrade), probably because they could see I had 4 calls to them just during the messed up online booking process.Yay! Maybe they’re going to turn this around! 3) The suite is totally underwhelming. I can’t believe people are paying $700+/night for this. There is zero special about this room other than the views. As plain and normal as you can imagine. There is nothing 5 star about these rooms. No special bedding, or toiletries, or anything. Very, very basic interior design, nothing luxe about this place. Very minimalist, and not in the nice Scandinavian way. My bedroom at home is more comfortable (I’m not kidding). 4) no tables available at club lounge for the evening canapés. You need to get there at 5pm to get a seat. We could wait 45min (until 7.30 when it closes at 8). We went back to our room (with the same view) and paid for room service even though we paid for club lounge. What’s the point?5) The sofa bed in the suite is shockingly unacceptable. No one could ever sleep on that without getting bruises from the springs. And this is a suite!!! Truly, I’ve never seen anything like it. I thought my kids were being moody pre-teens until they made me lay on it. We had to ask for 5(!!!) comforters to put on the bed so our kids could (maybe) sleep. Do not plan on using their sofa beds. I can’t imagine any of them are decent. Totally unacceptable. Really shocking. They’ve “made a note of it”. Good luck. 6) next day they deliver 2 roll away beds that are actually ok. (They wanted to charge me for them the night before). Of course they waive the fee because the bed is unacceptable. 7) I booked Lavo for my husband’s bday dinner. Made a special note that it was his birthday, that I’d like to do something special, gave his name, everything. We had to wait for our table because the group before was still there (even though they had already paid). Great service, great food, until they stood over us to take our wine away (still plenty of time before Covid cut off) never asked if we’d like a dessert, didn’t do anything for husband’s birthday despite the special notes. Nothing. I’m done. I will never stay here again. It is not worth the money at all. Mandarin Oriental, Pan Pacific, Ritz Carlton... they all have similar views and you actually get what you pay for. This is not even airport hotel quality. I’m just shocked. We got our pictures in the pool, and that’s honestly the only reason to come here. Don’t waste your money on a “nice” room. Stay one night in the cheapest they offer if you want the “experience”. There’s no difference. The service is amazing and I feel awful for all the people who work so hard inside of systems that don’t work and rooms that are totally unacceptable.Don’t waste your money on a staycation here. If our second night wasn’t my husband’s birthday, I would have cancelled and gone home. I have NEVER even considered doing something like that. This was just SO bad. Really unbelievable. And not the staff’s fault. That’s the worst part. The people here are so nice and they’ve tried to make up for every shortcoming, but I’ve spent half my stay complaining (which is not normal for me). They’ve made concessions every time, but I don’t need (or want) free stuff. I’m happy to pay. But I expect to get what I pay for. They aren’t able to deliver on that here, unfortunately. HUGE disappointment. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
18,3.0,"Marina Bay Sands is a landmark. And somehow, it kind of just stops there.The exterior is splendid, and upon stepping into the lobby, you are greeted by a sense of modern grandeur. From here on, the hotel experience would start to appear lacklustre as compared to its glamour. Before I go on, do understand that I have very high expectations of this establishment because of its reputation and, of course, price tag.Majority of staff are well-trained and polite most of the time, but none of them displayed the intuition or sincerity that is characteristic of exceptional hospitality. My husband and I, two sleep-deprived parents carrying our 5-month old, checked in at the counter. It was all smooth-sailing, and at the end of it all, the counter staff asked if we needed anything else. We said no because we just wanted to rest. During the entire interaction, he was pleasant, but did not once ask if we needed anything for the baby, like a cot or baby bathtub, which we had forgotten to request for at check-in as we were very tired. For that matter, MBS is also the first and only five-star hotel I have been to so far that does not provide anything extra for the little ones as a welcome gift (our elder 5 year old was also staying with us). We booked a two-room suite, which, other than being very (too?) spacious, was really quite average in terms of design. This was our second time staying at the hotel, and I remember having the same feeling when I stepped into the room for the first time: very underwhelmed by both its decor and lack of personal touches. The best thing about the room was outside the room: the view was beautiful. Towards the end of our first day of stay, we ran out of bottled water in the room. I called to request for more without stating the number of bottles, just one or two more would be good as well, because we were staying with two young children and we haven’t had the time to boil a lot of water or go out to buy some. But the reply I received was “Miss, we already gave you 6 bottles of water, and that is the limit for the day. Any additional bottle will be charged at $5 per bottle.” I was both amused and bemused by her reply. Amused because it is a rather rude response delivered in a smiley, polite, well-rehearsed manner; and bemused because why would a hotel as grand and big as the MBS be haggling with me over something as small as a bottle of water? To be fair, I think the hotel is doing a fairly good job with crowd control during this difficult period, everything could be easily booked online with links and notifications provided via SMS. Also, the lady in charge of making up our room was really sweet, we left a tip for her (with the money we didn’t use to buy bottled water from the hotel ) and she responded with the kind gesture of leaving four small packs of snacks and a pile of gold coin chocolates for us and our kids. I don’t think I will stay here again, at least not in the near future. I do hope that, if I ever choose to stay at MBS again some day, this will be a true world-class 5-star hotel, as impressive on the inside as it already is on the outside.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
19,4.0,"1st time doing a staycay here. Very impressed by the staff of MBS. This is the only hotel so far ( among the rest of my 5-star hotel staycay) that I’m very impressed by the awesome customer service manned by the “express service” team. Other than being professional in the way they talk to you, they really know exactly what your requests are all done with a smile in their tone and this is done consistently among the different employees I spoke to. Other hotels in-house operator team just does not execute this type of service with the same level of professionalism. The housekeeping team too is very professional and very friendly. I just requested for a top-up of certain toiletries without room make up but the lady servicing my room took her own initiative to also do a quick clean up of the bathroom even though I said there’s no need to. Management of MBS should be proud of their training for their staff cos it really shows! ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

27,5.0,"Decided to do a staycation here with my family in celebration of their birthdays as well. It’s been 10 years since MBS were built, finally time to treat ourselves after admiring the building every time we would pass it. I would like to start by saying everything was BETTER THAN EXPECTED. My first impression was already great when I was kindly greeted at the check in counter. Handled by Mr Mark & Miss Mary Jane(I might get her name wrong)  at tower 3, both of them were very polite and explain to me everything in detail about the hotel. Where I can get my membership card, my hotel gifts, recommended me where to go and shop for better deals. That already was a very good start to my stay. Only to make things better, I actually felt almost everyone working in MBS is really well trained. They see you, they greet you with a welcoming message. Small gestures like this is what makes me really appreciative of them. It feels like everyone knew how important their role is to a guest despite where they’re stationed at. So a special thanks to everyone who made my day from people working front of desk, to housekeepers, restaurant servers, chefs, ladies working in souvenirs shop and even securities there. In time of covid now, it’s a challenge for everyone working and showing happiness yet they manage to execute things so well. We got the premier room on the 41st level and WOW oh WOW. We booked two rooms, one facing the city and one harbour. It was bigger than expected! View was MAGNIFIQUE! Room and toilet was clean. Toilet was spacious than what I thought too, with bathtub and everything you need. Infinity pool was amazing despite water pretty cold in day time and night haha. Get the laksa if you decide to room service ur meal in your hotel :P My mum actually even misplace her hotel gifts at the lobby and we were pretty bumped about losing it. But tried our luck asking before checkout to see if anyone found anything and to our surprise yes someone did!! The honesty of people working there.. Being a local, it feels wonderful that I actually felt like I was in a holiday at another country. So thank you MBS once again for making my family staycation a memorable one! Worth every single cents, didn’t disappoint at all. Definitely coming back with friends and family again. My only feedback was the carpark to hotel is quite a distance. So esp if you have elderly, I would recommend to just take the MRT/ taxi as I personally think it’s way more convenient. Alternatively, get the valet service. :)","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

All the towels are sealed for hygiene and we are assured of the cleanliness in the room.The view from the top/infinity pool is nice and even if you don’t swim, it’s recommended to go up and see the scenery.

We did not have to wait and checked in smoothly at the appointed time. This was a huge contrast to our experience a few months back at RWS. The staff were consistently very good. Clearly well trained, takes pride in their work and care for the customers.We booked two rooms - a Premier room and a deluxe room for our family, not knowing that the the different room type meant we will need to stay in different towers. Yuri who checked us in was very gracious in upgrading our deluxe room to a premier one so that our family can stay at the same tower and on the same floor. The rooms were very well appointed and clean. The towels were all shrink wrapped to better ensure hygiene and the TV remote had a cover for this purpose too - very thoughtful. The CNY chocolates and free mini bar were nice touches. Great housekeeping meant we come back to very clean well maintained rooms every evening. Throughout our stay, all the staff we engaged with were very professional and courteous. I would also like to commend Mary Jane who checked us out and Chelvi who processed our valet parking when we were leaving.Many thanks to the MBS team for the great service that made our staycation so memorable.

The food was surprisingly to my liking although sometimes it's not that good (chefs may have bad days too)But the happy part of this is the front desk staffs who deserves a pat on the back for doing a good job.,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

As it is our first time and we do not have any preference in terms on which tower, Ms Iryn told us that she selected tower 2 for us as the harbor view is nicer there. Her instructions to the various attractions were also clear and precise. Went to the sky park, infinity pool, artscience museum and gym as part of the hotel perks. Awesome stay!","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

While waiting for our reservation to call, my grandmother suddenly felt dizzy and was about to fall (as she hadn’t eaten anything yet and my mum was not around). Luckily there’s a lady walk past who saw this and quickly came over to hold on to her, as I’m was unable to lift her. Both of us hold on to her, and I quickly called my mum to come over to help us. I sincerely wish to thank that lady who came and help us. Saw her name tag as Chris. She should be one of the staff from the Giftshop (tower 2), as I saw her walked into that store after that. Once again, I would like to thank her for help and being alert at that situation.  Thank you, Chris","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Her natural warmth and accomodating gestures makes us want to come back for more. As some of us decided to fill up for a membership, the lady by the name Yico was very helpful and patient not only to us but to everyone in the queue doing some enquiries. I cant help but give credit to these service oriented ladies. May their tribe continue to grow.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Every process was arranged very well and smooth from the pre-arrival until the day of check-in. The front desk Mustika & Glady are very friendly and hospitable. Great breakfast with excellent service by Chloe from Rise restaurant. The 20 layer cake is really good from Lavo and thanks for the service by Deborah.

47,5.0,"I stayed for just a night for my solemnization celebration at RISE restaurant.  Although i had only booked a normal room, upon check in (which was really fast!) i was upgraded to a higher category with a complimentary late check out. It was a great surprise which i didn't expect.But the true surprise was in seeing the room. given the 44th floor, the room was vast and had huge panoramic window views of the Marina. Truly breathtaking! I am so devasted that in our stress to complete things prior to our solemnization, we didnt have time to take photos or to really appreciate the stunning views.We left the room for a couple of hours to attend to some errands and upon our return, we were met with another surprise, this time with a petite chocolate cake for our ""wedding"". It was simply a element of surprise taken to another level.From the huge room, to the bathtub and Roberto Cavalli amenities, we  were truly blown away. For a hotel which never sleeps, I am really intrigued and awed by the superb service levels by all members of staff. Kudos to all and special gratitude to Mr. Ramesh Govindasamy; the Manager who upgraded us!You made our stay a truly memorable one and though we regretted not booking MBS for our honeymoon, we will definitely return for another staycation!Marina Bay Sands has shown that hospitality and service is not lost in Singapore after all! well done once again and thank you so much for creating our wonderful memories","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
48,5.0,"One night staycation with family (two kids) during post Covid period .Taking up the $399 staycation package (S$50 dining or spending credits) which I think is reasonable ( or else would be overprice for local staycation as local can just visit the shopping abd restaurants there anyway) . What I like: Spacious room with great view ( must choose higher floor ) I tried my luck requested  for free upgrade room. Lucky enough I got it . maybe this is due to Covid Low peak seasons during weekday.  Nevertheless, please try to top up to get the higher floor with Marina Bay view as you definitely don’t want to missed this floor to ceiling abd wall to wall full height maximised view from the room. It was awesome !  Great pool . Covid period only limited to one hour but limited hour mean lesser people at pool and you can take more great photos or enjoy peacefully at the sky high  infinity pool . Early check in available subject to availability. I lucky bright to check in as early around 10am . I think this was just exceptional case during Low peak period . Nice interior and environment with most restaurants abd shopping right at door steps.Things to be improved:Nothing much but I think personal touch of hospitality through the staffs or room deco could be further improved to reach to next level of 5 star standard. Generally satisfied with our stay. Maybe will stay again if i missed the pool and awesome view from the room again, and if there is value promotion again. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

She must have the notable number of complimentary feedbacks so I regret that I can write only one! + don’t go to infinity pool at night. Because it was extremely cold. ️Ashely라는 한국인 직원분이 계신데, 매우 친절하십니다. 처음 가본지라 여러 시설들에 대해 이것저것 여쭙고 혜택사항들도 질문을 꽤 많이 했었는데, 자세하고 친절하게 알려주셔서 감사했습니다. 저녁은 blossom 이라는 차이니즈 레스토랑에서 먹었는데 음식은 괜찮으나 아무래도 MBS내부에 위치한 만큼 가격대비 잘 먹고 좋은 서비스를 받았다고 느끼진 못했습니다. 그리고 인피니티풀은 가시려면 6-8시 사이가 좋은 것 같습니다. 밤시간에는 바람도 많이 불고 추워서 추천하지는 않습니다. 싱가포르 여행시 하루에서 이틀정도 머물기에 최적입니다.

50,5.0,"Marina Bay Sands stands triple in its own category of ultra-elite and in the top 10 most expensive Hotels ever constructed in the World. Along with the Burj Al Arab, Burj Khalifa, Wynn Palace Macao and Abraj Al-Bait they’ve marked the World with their unique structures coupled with incredible feats of Architectural and Engineering achievements. Our luxury experience commenced as soon as we stepped foot off our plane, our MBS representative met us at the gate, whisked us through the Airport, customs & security, assisted with luggage and escorted us to our waiting MBS Mercedes transportation where our driver greeted us with cold wash clothes, water and champagne to set us in the mood for what was about to come. We appreciated this exceptional reception after an 15hr flight, feeling a little jet lagged and we immediately felt refreshed. Upon arrival at the Hotel another MBS representative met us at the curbside drop off, had valet & bell service ready to unload our luggage and greeted us with smiles and excitement that we chose MBS as our destination. We were immediately taken to our Sands Suite and bypassed the long check in lines where the check in process was completed efficiently in our room allowing us to relax and start our MBS experience. Our Sands Suite was spacious outfitted with a Dining area, Bar, Pool Table, Living Room, separate Bedroom, large Ensuite and 2 Balconies facing the Gardens by the Bay. Once we settled in our beautiful suite, the urge to explore set in and immediately we set off to the Sky Park & Pool to truly take in the Singapore Skyline and all its beauty. The 200m high, 146m long Infinity Pool is something that has to be seen in person, it’s remarkable and unlike anything we’ve experienced. The Pool offered breath taking views of the Skyline, and you felt like you were swimming on top of the World. The service was exceptional, the drinks & food came quickly and we rarely had time to set an empty drink down before another arrived. The MBS experience continued with the Shoppes at MBS. The Mall offers a variety of luxury and brand name stores coupled with countless restaurants that took the day to walk through and appreciate the comprehensive MBS Shoppes. We were delighted as the stores within MBS Shoppes offered delivery service back to our Room which made the shopping experience effortless and relaxing. The boardwalk in front of the MBS Shoppes is a great place to go for a walk or run and explore the Marina area including the Artscience Museum, we enjoyed the many exhibits and different workshops offered to appreciate local artistry and the many works of Art. The MBS experience includes 60 restaurants to dine and choose from which we would need weeks at MBS to take them all in, our favourite signature restaurants were, Michelin Star Cut by Wolfgang Puck, Chinoiserie Modern Asian by Justin Quek, DB Bistro & Oyster Bar by Daniel Boulud, Lavo Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar, Spago Dining Room by Wolfgang Puck and Bread Street by Gordon Ramsay. Throughout the day we also dined at several of the countless restaurants within the MBS area but there are too many to list. Our experience at each one of them was excellent, the servers were all pleasant and made our dining experience enjoyable. One of the highlights we rarely encounter was a server taking our order and different dedicated servers running drink and food orders to the tables. It made sure your order was delivered in a timely fashion with the several guests seated. Our servers would stop by often to ensure the meals were up to our satisfaction and made sure our glasses were always full. The MBS experience continues with exploring the Beautiful Gardens by the Bay, walking amongst the incredible SuperTrees, world’s largest glass Greenhouses and appreciating the amazing Garden Artistry. The River Cruise is a great way to go a little deeper into the heart of Singapore and take in the local historic buildings and learn more about the origins of Singapore. The MBS Hotel Casino is a site in itself, multiple levels of entertainment and gambling for those who choose to take part. Make sure to bring your passport as security is tight and they check everyone entering / exiting the Casino for their identification. The MBS Hotel structure is Iconic and towers over the Marina Bay and River, offering unparallel views of the Singapore cityscape. The MBS experience is different for everyone, but ours was 5 stars and we wished we could have spent more time at this beautiful Hotel. You can’t truly appreciate everything the MBS experience has to offer within a few days, we’d recommend staying for at least 4-5 days or more to take in all the experiences, explore the Singapore area and appreciate the masterpiece that MBS Hotel truly is.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

The rooms were spacious and clean, and there are so many attractions to explore nearby. The staff were attentive, friendly and professional.

53,1.0,"Choosen MBS for friend staycation as there were many good reviews. However to my horror, service and rules were so so bad. Front desk Nicolette and manager kenny are super unprofessional and unhelpful. Booked 2 rooms for 4 person. Was denied connecting room as we were friends. Worse is denied having rooms at the same floor. So whats the point of having a stayca when rooms were so far away. Explanation given were MBS rules for COVID Prevention. Do not understnad why total of 5 people allowed in 1 room but having room at the same floor not allowed. Worse is Manager Kenny did not gave a professional explanation but blamed it in the MBS regulation. MBS really need to review their rules in allocating room. Such a fruatrating and diaappointed staycation. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

The bed was comfy and the bathroom had very nice amenities! Service was prompt and the staff were polite and attentive. We had breakfast at Spago and the food and service did not disappoint. Our toddler had an amazing time at the infinity pool. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable time.

55,4.0,"After it opened 10 years ago, the room we stayed in - Premier King Garden /Harbour View - is showing its age. But what made our staycation a memorable one were the excellent staff service, the check-in arrangement and communications, and a pleasant surprise. I requested for early check-in at 2pm, and this went smoothly due to the queue arrangement and SMS communication, notifying me in the morning on what time to arrive at the hotel. The female staff who checked us patiently answered a list of my questions and helped to upgrade our room when she found out that we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The room’s Express Service helped to arranged for a security staff to my room in less than 10mins after my call to solve an issue with the room safe. Similarly, when I discovered tiny black bits - not sure what they were - in the water after boiling using the kettle provided, a new one was sent to me within 10mins after calling the Express Service. The male housekeeping staff was very polite and apologized for the kettle issue.While waiting for the lift to go up to the observatory deck, the male staff attending to us was very engaging and had a nice conversation with us. He even remembered us when we were exiting the area after our deck visit and bid goodbye to us even though he had other guests to attend to. We were also happy with the arrangement at the infinity sky pool. After managing to book the slot we wanted when we booked the room, we were promptly reminded via SMS in the time to be there. The number of people allowed in the pool was perfect as it was not crowded, and we managed to take great photos without the usual crowded pool pre-COVID periods. A “glitch” to the stay was the bed where we found the mattress to be very hard, thereby not having a comfortable sleep. If not for this, I would have given a 5-star rating.The T&C and Lucky 8 sandwiches and raspberry muffin at Origin + Bloom were delicious but the mocha was too sweet.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

You can always count on the MBS staff on site!

57,3.0,"Staycation of 3 family members in room at non peak weekday. I might have too much expectations for this hotel thus i felt disappointed. Cons: The moment you enter the lobby, no directions were given where to check in or join the queue. During check-in, receptionist was not welcoming and needs to improve on tonality. Front desk was leaking water and dripped on me, didn’t apologise or offer me tissue and just replied “yea we’re working on this” Did not explain anything about hotel facilities only point to me the lift lobby. Every morning we walk down the corridor or lobby , no staff will greet us. It doesn’t feel like a luxury hotel at all. Pros: Room was nice, spacious, clean, nothing to complain about. Swimming pools staffs were the best , nice and friendly and will make effort to remember your face and greet you. With covid measures, not so crowded at the pool, even though only an hour usage per day, it was good. Our room attendant was very nice and attentive, came in just before we went out and double checked with us if there any additional items/towels we required. Overall, didn’t really enjoy the whole hotel experience. But recommend to go only during promo price to try infinity pool. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

There were 3 restaurants to choose from for breakfast, we tried the exclusive clubroom and Spago. Quality of food at the clubroom was slightly better than at Spago. But still great nonetheless, they only served TWG tea. Coffee at the club was also better.We managed to book an hour for the pool only. Views didn disappoint.

Booked a 2D1N stay in premium room for 3 pax and it was a great overall experience. MBS has staggered check-in process by making advanced sms bookings, unfortunately I missed this information in the email they have sent and only know when I reached the check-in counter. But the check-in process was rather smooth once it reaches my turn. Got a room at the 30th floor, great view, great room. I managed to book a 1-hr pool session and it was a nice experience but rather short, sadly. There were activities to keep me occupied for the 2 days: touring of Art Science Museum, dining at Koma, shopping, great sleep in the room. Overall, enjoyable!","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Special shoutout to Wawa, the staff attendant, and Nas, the life guard also for their help. This was not our first time at MBS, but I'd say that this visit has became more memorable and amazing because of the service of these pool staff especially Mr. Dennis. Marina Bay Sands is truly lucky to have such a remarkable staff. Even though we are visiting during this pandemic, we still felt safe as they explained to us how the hotel makes sure the cleanliness and sanitation for the safety of all guests are a priority. We are particular when it comes to service whether in restaurants, or hotels BUT their service really stood us. Nowadays, it's really valuable to us customers when the staff shows their utmost concern and care. Thank you so much again Dennis, Wawa, and Nas!

There was the bathroom which came with bathtub, rain shower and double sinksIt is reassuring to see the SG Clean-certified integrated resort take cleaning and safe distancing very seriously. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, it is best to book your slot for afternoon tea and evening cocktail at the club 55 as well as to use the infinity pool upon reservation of the room to avoid disappointmentEvery angle of MBS is made for the gram.

I was very touched and impressed with his act of service. It was a lovely family staycation- will return! ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
68,1.0,"Booked 3 rooms for a family staycation but sadly it was a forgettable experience. 1. Checking in took close to an hour for just one room. Subsequently was told that the other room keys will be left in the room that was ready. When my family members reached and was registering the two front office agents mentioned that there is no such thing as leaving the room keys in the room. Wrong info throughout 2. Tried to book slots for the infinity pool but system was full of bugs and eventually could not secure any slots. Was told by the front office agent that when I was trying to book on Oct 15 the system just went live and it was the first implementation thus there were a lot of bugs. Only managed to get a 9.30am slot in the end. 3. Staffs were poorly trained. Wanted to visit the sky park but was directed to the bridge heading towards Gardens by the bay. 4. While checking in was never informed where Breakfast was and I had to call and ask. While breakfast at Rise cafe was poor. Signal to one of the staff as I wanted to order food, she acknowledged but never came back. Had to wait in vain as no one bothers to take your order. 5. While checking in was never informed that the person booking the room had to be present to apply for the sands membership lifestyle card in the end we had to make multiple trips to apply. Wasted almost half a day doing all the admin stuffs. Poorly managed processes and very lousy communication. 6. Was never informed that for baby cot it had to be reserved way ahead. The front office agent told me that he will check on the availability of the baby cot ended up no one got back. All in all for the price paid it was totally not worth it. Probably also because it was under the healthcare promo that was why service and quality were compromised. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Recommend to pay a little more for Club Lounge benefits as the general queues were so long! Room quality was excellent with a view over Gardens by the Bay. Tips: have your breakfast only at Spago’s as the food & coffee quality is superior to the other restaurant options. Our butler service was great - we had fruits, cookies , milk , cakes delivered daily ! Book your pool slot in advance and you won’t be disappointed with the amazing experience swimming in the sky with our beautiful city skyline as a backdrop. Five stars for the high service quality among every staff and the room quality. Hope that the TVs can be upgraded soon as it looks pretty outdated.

Some parts of the hotel may not be spanking new (eg balcony tiles), but we were beyond satisfied by the excellence in customer service during our stay - certainly reason enough to want to come back again! Whenever we called with any concern (bathroom, pool slot and belongings left behind), this was not only addressed professionally, but empathetically and most swiftly. I must say, for a massive hotel, Marina Bay Sands Singapore really has surprised us with the impeccable standard of guest relations. They clearly have guest satisfaction at top priority and therefore understood inside out, leaving even the most discerning guest impressed and assured to have an enjoyable, memorable time. Special thanks first and foremost to Edmund who took our feedback seriously and went above and beyond to meet expectations, Peter who followed up diligently to find the best solution for us, Nicole who also saw to our extra request and the 3 polite housekeeping gentlemen who attended to us at night and in the day.

I actually like their crowd control measure whereby check in and facility booking are queued via SMS.Room making was excellent. On the second day I placed a couple of champagne glasses and the service crew, Jian Yang placed the same number of coaster and espresso cubes for my guest as well.

Through so much debate I know I would not win it since it's hotel policy which is ridiculous, how much space does 6 months old child need?!The hotel management need to review their room policy again!","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
80,5.0,"I wasn't very happy about the time it took for checking in (even after I had provided all information via online check-in), but everything thereafter was very good. Room was perfect with natural light and fantastic view. Well maintained room accessories, high quality bathroom fittings and well-cleaned windows hinted that the hotel pays attention to details. Clean towels wrapped for higher safety during the pandemic. Perfectly working air-conditioning control and WiFi was better than expected. Room service was excellent both in terms of food quality and classy delivery. Infinity pool experience was excellent, almost magical as advertised.We hit two snags during our stay, a problem with the hot water and TV. We tried the 'priority service' button on the phone a few times but we couldn't get anyone on the other side. They weren't serious problems so I didn't bother escalating.Hotel follows safe distancing protocols to the letter - almost to an annoying level. However, I wouldn't complain about it.I would stay here again.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Pool was by appointment but worth the effort as it was no longer crowded. Room comes with balcony, with nice view of garden by the bay, though the balcony needs some cleaning, could be due to covid19. Restaurants just below my room and mrt within walking distance.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

83,3.0,"Firstly, it may be a one time thing. We got the room with noisy fridge(i thought was aircon) which makes me (a light sleeper person) not able to sleep on the first night. After i gave them a feedback, they straightly change the fridge to the new one without noise. I was almost gave up my second night to just go back home as there is no point to do staycation without good sleep. Thankfully after they changed the fridge, everything was OK.They have strict number of guest come and go into the tower. They count it in front of the lift entrance. So bear in mind to give ample time as it can be quite a queue on busy hours. As far my staycation journey goes, this is the only hotel that does it.The pool is limited to 1 hour and very hard to get slot. Make sure to book early. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

85,5.0,"We truly had a wonderful time at MBS! The room we stayed at is a premiere room.  The view from our room was the Gardens by the Bay, and it was just so relaxing! It was very spacious, even the bathroom with a very nice bath tub.  The room was very clean.  The towels and robes were even hygienically  packed and sealed. Special thanks to one of the housekeeping staff Xi Mei.  I appreciate her initiative of placing  a kiddie slipper and a small towel for my child  when we returned to our room without us requesting for it.  My daughter was happy she has her own kiddie slipper as we had ours. They also have some complimentary drinks (2 soda cans and 2 bottles of juice in the mini fridge, bottled water and snacks. Also, we have complimentary tickets to the observatory.  The only sad part is we were not able to swim in the infinity pool.  We did not know that we have to book a timeslot once we received the confirmation of our booking.  We booked and received the confirmation a month earlier.  We thought that booking in the infinity pool is upon check in.  So, we just enjoyed the beautiful view while having our dinner at Ce la vi (rooftop) Overall we had our best staycation this year! Thank you MBS !","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
86,5.0,"Booked a premier city view room with a bathtub to create more play space for our young kids. Didn't regret the decision as they had a lot of fun running around the room and enjoyed themselves with water play in the bathtub. They were also charmed by the city view every morning when they woke up and the night skyline during bedtime. Besides these, we also had complimentary tickets to head up to the observatory and it was a magnificent view up there! Foodwise, there were a lot of options and the kids were able to eat for free at the buffet restaurants in MBS as they were under 5. We were surprised that we had to book a timeslot at the infinity pool so it's good to book the slots the moment you receive a confirmation email from the hotel. Special thanks to the staff who went the extra mile to accommodate our different requests like the kids' bedroom slippers and for making our stay an enjoyable one!","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

88,4.0,"Staycation?!?! Never in our holidays plans.But when air, land and sea is not an option for the year. Staycation might be best option.Booked a premium room with city view.The room size was huge,so was the bathroom with separate standing shower room and bathtub.Family with younger kids or babies will love it because you have ample size to park your gigantic stroller and large space to open your luggages.However, they do not have brushing kit or brushing mug for kids if you forgot to bring one. Bathrobes and slippers provided a upon request. (shouldn't that be included in the room since they know there are kids checking in?) Not to mentioned about having a stool for your kids to wash their hands or brush their teeth.A big bathroom does not necessary provide you with more clothes hanging option as it has minimal hanging bar or nodes for you to hang your wet swim wears, towels and clean clothes. So one has to be creative.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

92,5.0,"Had a night at MBS. Price wise is definitely high even though it was reduced due to no travellers during COVID era. However, service and quality of the hotel speaks for the price itself. Everything was top notch. From front desk to the security team to its room service. Will definitely return if i have extra money. The view at the infinity pool is definitely one you have to visit once in your lifetime. Even though MBS is 10 years old, amazingly it was well maintained. All in all, such an amazing staycaytion. Trust me, one night isnt enough! Kudos to the staff for making my stay a memorable one. ","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5
93,3.0,"Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you must visit if you come to Singapore, like a checkbox in a to-do list. The rooms are clean and quite comfortable in 2010 style. TVs are from another age though.First of all, if you come by car, be aware that there is no direct access from the car park to the hotel. You will have to walk through the entire adjoining mall with your luggage. And the mall is huge. You can tell that your stay does not start off in the best possible way.The hotel also is awsomely big, Somehow, we have a bit of the impression of being in Las Vegas or even at the airport, especially at the time of check-in.Because of COVID-19, you can only use the pool for one hour a day, provided you have managed to reserve a time slot, which is not always possible. We came to celebrate our daughter's 4th birthday. However, neither slippers nor bathrobe were available for a child.I came, I checked the box. Next.","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Definitely hands down the best pool in the world on top of the hotel and only for hotel guests. Food here is the best!

97,4.0,"Never really thought I'd do a staycation, but with Covid putting paid to all travel plans for the last so many months a weekend away at a hotel barely a few kilometres from home suddenly seemed to be not that bad of an idea.The good - The hotel does a really great job of prioritizing health and safety and it felt very safe.The infinity pool - was not my first time, so the charm had admittedly worn off but was an instant hit with the rest of the folks in my group.  Hard to find fault with what's truly an eclectic experienceThe views and the glitz - Enjoyed both the city and garden views, both were good in their own ways.  The city room views don't have a balcony though.  We got upgraded to the Orchid suite for the second night and it was only after that we could appreciate the richness and the grandeur that the hotel is known for.The not so good - 1. The endless loop of checking in and out (safe entry) even when using facilities inside the hotel was annoying.  To the extent that, house guests will have to leave the hotel join the general public queue at street level, check-in, queue up to get to the skydeck.  The emphasis on safety is in the right spirit, but some of the measures put in place definitely felt like overkill2. Impossible to get bookings at the restaruant - Perhaps pre  check-in the they can inform the guests of the need to book the restaurants in advance like the swimming pool - Spent an entire weekend without getting to eat at any of the restaurants (in room dining was good though3. Some really poor customer experience in some places, but on the positive side the hotel was very receptive to feedback and also gave a nice upgrade","Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore",4.5

7,1.0,"My previous stay had been pleasant so i booked confidently this time around and even pre-paid for a month's stay (01-29 April 2021). I would come to regret this! As service was abysmal, i requested to shorten my stay but Hotel was not agreeable.Check-in: ""Darren"" checked me in. Smooth process; minimal conversation = cold welcome! I offered my CC, he declined. I discovered later, when i met friends at the Orchard Cafe for drinks that i couldn't sign charges to my room. The Orchard Cafe lady informed me, ""You're not allowed to charge anything."" WOW! Room: Pros: Spacious.Cons: Dusty mirrors and counter areas. Air-con was not cold and sink had a water draining problem. Sink was boat-shaped in design; lovely to look at but not functional! Narrow part of sink is closest to tap; so when washing hands, water inevitably drips down onto the floor, making the floor very slippery!Staff's attitude: From Front Desk (Darren) to a couple of Concierge and Call Centre Operators, i experienced rude and condescending attitude. Darren: i shared some concerns with him one evening. My perception = he was not overly concerned by what i had experienced. It appeared he was just going through the motions of listening to me! As during my check-in, he hardly conversed or responded to what i had raised.Concierge: Rang me to ask if i was in quarantine; then i was told very rudely to, ""Come down and collect yourself!""  I had some food items delivered to the hotel and had requested that Concierge bring them up to my room. When i called out the staff on deliberately pushing an erroneous quarantine policy, he apologised and promptly brought up my ordered items!Call Centre Operators: Lyn: Like Concierge, she too persisted in demanding that, i ""should collect the ordered items"" myself as i wasn’t in quarantine. She too walked her claim back later when i pushed back!Discrimination: I had witnessed Concierge accepting food items from an outside vendor and offer to deliver them to the hotel guest. I don’t understand why this service is offered to only some guests. Additionally, Concierge the world over deliver all sorts of miscellaneous items to hotel guests. Why this appeared to be an issue with Call Operator Lyn and the Concierge is beyond me.Security: ""Contact Tracing"" service is not consistent.Hotel Front end: Staff are conscientious. to the extent that one of my guest was DENIED ACCESS into the hotel! And at Hotel Back-end, the staff-member ""Jerry"" waves guests through - both on accessing and exiting hotel without scanning documents or taking the temperature!Overall, it appears from previous TripAdvisor reviews, that the hotel has not been able to address concerns raised in these reviews. I’d recommend you spend your money at a hotel that actually values you as a guest.The staff are inexperienced and lack professional training. They don’t seem to have the skills or qualities required in the hospitality industry.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

It is hard too not comfortable to sleep on.4th:Going in the swimming pool, the Indian pool attendant was using the hp while on duty I presume.when we came and ask us if we made a reservation n ask us if we screenshot the reservation, I have been to so many hotel in SG this the 1st time they ask me for a screenshot of appointment.

9,2.0,"Orchard Hotel has always been our favourite hotel for staycations. We’ve also always recommended any family visiting Singapore to stay at Orchard, so we really take no pleasure in writing this review but hopefully it will help Orchard Hotel improve. On our last stay in November 2020, we noticed a slight decline in certain aspects of the hotel but needless to say, because of COVID-19 we kind of excused it away. We initially booked two nights, then extended for the third night for our 9th year anniversary. We checked in at 4pm (check in’s are at 3pm) and was told that check out would be at 11am! (usually at 12pm) We think it’s just appalling that COVID-19 is used as an excuse to start short changing your customers. We wouldn’t have mind it so much if the extra hour was used to thoroughly clean the rooms. But the room we got had noticeable cobwebs, and there was something sticky on the toilet seat. The pillows were the most disappointing part of the room. We were given 04 pillows. But as soon as you put your head on it, the pillows flattens so much that even the duvet was actually thicker. Even after pilling both pillows on top each other, we still woke up with neck aches.We also requested for ice and were shocked that it was now chargeable at $5.75. We have been around the world and stayed in countless different hotels and this is the first time we have been charged for ice. We know $5.75 isn’t a big amount but we were still shocked nonetheless. We went ahead with it as the mini fridge was not cold enough to chill our drinks. We called in again the second night to request for more ice. We had to call 4 times before someone actually answered our call and very grumpily with a “hello!” On checkout day, I used the hotels connecting door to Claymore Connect to get to the Cold Storage. On my way back into the hotel, I scanned the Safe Entry and the staff seated there (not sure if it’s hotel staff or mall staff) asked me where I was going. When I told her I was going into Orchard hotel, she replied very abruptly “which part?!” I told her that I was going back to my room, she told me “then you can just go ahead!” Very rude indeed. We understand that during COVID-19, your hotel might be understaffed and your employees might be overworked, but the consequences of it should never spill onto your paying hotel guests. GOOD THINGS WE EXPERIENCED DURING OUR STAY1) On our second night, we requested for two extra pillows which were sent up almost immediately. 2) Our request for ice were also always promptly sent up to us. 3) When we requested for ice on the third night, it was provided to us complimentary. 4) There was a Japanese front office personnel (I apologise for not catching his name) who attended to me when I wanted to extend another night, was very helpful and pleasant. 5) All the concierge staff that we have come across were all very friendly and pleasant.

Felt that if this was the case I shouldn't have been allowed to book an early check in slot. Nonetheless, we decided to try our luck 1hr later and they had an available room. This room seemed a bit dated and had certain deficiencies like a broken door and work out wallpaper. Called engineering to have it rectified but after they came they were unable to solve the door issue and suggested we change room. The second room had much better decor and seemed newer. Overall experience was good given the price. Both rooms were the same size but the newer one appeared bigger as the toilet was smaller. However if we had stayed in the first room throughout then it would have been a little underwhelming.

The first visit was full of crowds due to weekends. The front office team (Quam and Kenta) were extremely accommodating and allowed us to have a late checkout. So this was a big plus, especially that I checked in late at 6pm. Thoughtful sanitizer mobile device at the front desk counters for guests too! Many thanks to Quam for his meticulous and humble hospitality service.There were some hiccups, the minibar fridge wasn’t cold, an ice bucket for $5++, room bathroom can be renovated, eg bath tub too small and rundown, and dust in the toilet.Nonetheless, would definitely send a friend there and return for the reasonable room rates, for the location in town.

19,2.0,"As mentioned by a recent review, someone mentioned that the premier room 35m2 doesnt look like 35m2 at all. From my personal stay twice with the hotel, Grand Deluxe room is 22m2, NOT 28m2. Got cheated by the 28m2 room size to book their grand deluxe room. As seen from my images, the walking gap is only the size of a pillow.. The walking gap, be it toilet to the cupboard, both sides of the bed to the wall, all are only the size of a pillow. If you have two person walking, you would have to walk like a crab.Stayed at Orchard hotel earlier on this year, spending $151 per night. Was allocated a corner room. The corner room was even worst, the size is even smaller than the middle room. I have spoken to the reception, and was given another room (which is at the middle floor, which is only 22m2). Feedback to the assistant manager and a senior front desk staff, they mentioned that the corner room and the middle rooms are the same size, which I highly doubted so.I was not convinced. The corner room cant even place a long sofa, but the room at the middle can. This time round, I paid another $205 to stay at this hotel again. I brought along my measuring tools, and indeed, the grand deluxe room at the middle is only 6.5m x 3.5m = 22.75m2, not the 28m2 as claimed by the hotel. This is really very misleading. As someone who stayed before many hotels, I highly doubt that the room size (including the toilet) is 28m2 as claimed by the hotel staff. I have even taken the measurement right from the window to the back of the sofa seat (which was 70cm from the sofa seat). The 70cm space has basically eaten up the hotel room space.Prior to this stay, I have stayed at few other Singapore hotels such as Hilton, Furama City Centre, Furama RiverFront, Carlton Hotel, Amara Singapore, Rendezvous Hotel, Grand Park Orchard, Village Hotel Bugis, Hotel Royal, Hotel Royal @ Queens, M Hotel, Copthorne King, stayed at their deluxe room before, all have a room size of between 28m2 to 32m2. All those hotel rooms are way bigger than Orchard Hotel grand deluxe room 28m2 in size. It was quite obvious, by the amount of space you have to walk in the room.I have even taken the measurements from the window area (behind the sofa seat), right to the doorstep. I was not satisfied when the assistant manager told me it was measured by the engineers. There was no service recovery at all. A 5m x 5m would always be 5m x 5m, no matter how good the engineer is, no matter how advanced the digital measuring tools are.Hotels such as Four Points by Sheraton , Ramada hotel, they are all 22m2 to 23m2 in size. Their room looks almost the same as the Grand Deluxe room at Orchard Hotel.In addition, for the fish and chip that we have ordered, the coleslaw was very warm and sour. We have to discard it, to prevent from getting any food poisoning. Coleslaw has been known to be served cold, and not in a warm to hot temperature, tasting extremely sour. One might have mistaken it as lots of vinegar being mixed with the coleslaw. The wedged were good though. The soy chicken rice was not tasty, as the chicken breast was hard and dry. As my package which cost $205 includes the $50 dining credit, I have to order food from the orchard café. But our first time experience with the orchard café was a big disappointment. Furthermore, as shown on the image, there was a tiny bug moving slowly at the socket area there.Overall, the staycation was a great disappointment. I was very shocked and disappointed to be ""cheated"" by the hotel, being deceived by the hotel room size, 28m2 grand deluxe room published on their websites, and all other OTA. The worst part is that the senior female staff and the assistant manager told me that the corner room are of the same size as the rooms located in the middle (when one can place a long sofa, and the other is only 2 chairs and not a sofa). Furthermore, they added that be it the corner room and the rooms located in the middle, are 28m2, which I have finally found out that it was not meant to be 28m2, but 22m2.Would be planning few more staycations for the upcoming months. I would definitely not be staying at the Orchard hotel anymore, as they have deceived the guests, by proclaiming their grand deluxe room to be 28m2, when it was 25% smaller than the actual size.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
20,4.0,"Had a smooth staycation with Orchard hotel. I was suppose to stay in Deluxe room but the staff, Kent was kind and initiate to upgrade to Premier room. Many thanks to him; I enjoyed the room facilities even though it’s only for one night. Overall, good service and easy accessible in town.  Looking forward to stay with Orchard hotel again :)",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
21,4.0,"Our 6-month old baby had her first ever staycation at Orchard Hotel, and we have everything we need for this first experience with an infant. The front desk counter's service was impeccable; the staff were hospitable and warm. They left a very good first impression of our stay. The service among the hotel staff were good as well, be it the housekeeping, security or other staff.We stayed in a Premier King Room. While not the newest, it was spacious enough to place a cot beside our King Size Bed. The location of the hotel meant we were never far from the major shopping centres and eateries, so food and transport was never an issue despite us not driving. Would greatly recommend Orchard Hotel for all families with young children.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

Special thanks to staffs ChooiYen, Queenie, Nelson for making this birthday stay memorable & the team for the well wishes card + souvenirs. -On the side note for improvement: *Personally feel that the food selection was limited for breakfast. Breakfast experience 5/10. *Musky smell. Any diffuser / aroma scent in the room would be nice! -Overall experience: Enjoyable!",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
23,5.0,"Sincere thanks and compliments to Chooi Yen and Queenie for the excellent service. Their attention to detail as we made a mistake in our booking and effort to provide service beyond their duties is remarkable. The extra mile to explain the facilities  in the property and a little cake for a simple birthday made us really welcomed!Not forgetting that even when masked up, they “smiled” with their eyes. What makes a stay memorable besides comfort is definitely being well taken care of by true hospitality heros! Appreciate your services and many blessings!",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
24,5.0,"Many hotels have struggled to maintain service consistency, even the big brands, but Orchard Hotel had managed to attain a consistent level of good service.

This year was much quieter, as lions dance and dragon dance were not allowed.  However, it was still a good stay.  Everything was so familiar, since we have already stayed here several times.We were given a room overlooking the Orchard Road, and a full view of the swimming pool.  So it was a nice room with good view.  Room was spacious enough for an extra bed.  Although the room was not very big, it was cosy.Breakfast was served at Orchard Cafe.  There were only 4 or 5 main set we can order for breakfast, besides the beverages, cereals etc.  The western set was better, as compared to the Oriental set where the portion was not so much.The linkway from the hotel to Claymore Connect was only opened from 11am to 4pm (if I remember the timing correctly).  It was be a lot more convenient if the linkway can be opened till a later time instead only till 4pm.  On the first night of our stay, we went out during the evening to get something.  It was raining when we reached the hotel, and we need to walk past the hotel carpark entrance/exit to get to the hotel lobby.  It was really inconvenient.On the second night, after our dinner at the Peranakan restaurant at Claymore Connect, we need to again walk past the carpark entrance/exit to get the hotel lobby.  It was rather dangerous as we have young children and elderly walking together with us, and there were cars driving in and out at the carpark.So I hope that hotel can consider extending the opening hours of the linkway to Claymore Connect, which will bring great convenience to the as there is Cold Storage in Claymore Connect.Beside the linkway, everything was good and it was a nice stay for us to celebrate Chinese New Year.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
26,1.0,It's was such disappointing to discovered that my bedsheets was sticking a single hair of someone's. As after I checked in to the room 1220 less than 30 minutes on 3rd March 2021. At once I call the operator. Less than 10 minutes a Chinese lady arrived to my room. As I showed her the hair. She still can ask me wanna change new bedsheets or not... really kind of extra foolish question. As she changes it after my answer is Yes. After all its my 1st time to choose staying this hotel. For such simple mistake. it's really gave me kind of feeling I won't want to recommend my contacts to consider choosing this hotel for rooms check-in. It's kind of very sensitive issues for this Covid 19 period that my sleeping bedsheets that have someone's hair left over.,Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
27,5.0,"We wouldn’t have thought to have held our wedding at any other venue than the newly renovated, beautiful and grandiose Orchard Hotel Ballroom. Equipped with a highly updated sound and lighting system, coupled with 2 huge LED screens, the ballroom is set to be a dream venue for any couple out there.But the most important feature which actually made our wedding experience an unforgettable one was the staff of Orchard hotel. From day one of the ballroom viewing, to the food tasting and the wedding day itself and at checkout, Haze and Mun Kiat who were the sales and operations personnel attached to us, ensured that our every need is attended to. No stone was left unturned. They, together with the banquet staff during the wedding reception really bend (bent?) their back backwards as they provided holistic customer service and superior operational efficiency to us and our guests. We really can’t thank you both enough. Thank you for being informative and keeping us at ease throughout the whole wedding. Here’s to more events at Orchard Hotel! ️",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

Complimentary early check in & late check out was given :) Another thing I'm disappointed that room service starting to charge guest for a bucket of ice @ $5. We had to buy a packet of ice from the nearest 7-Eleven located at Orchard Tower.

Called for a technician and came back after dinner to a toilet full of cigarette fumes. While the response was appropriate it took a substantial amount of time. Went for breakfast but was told to go up and change out of my clothes because they were “inappropriate” - bear in mind my clothes covered me from head to toe, exposing nothing. Went up to change and to my horror the staff let a lady in spaghetti straps and fbt shorts in. Katherine/Catherine, one of the female managers in the khaki jacket was the one who made me go up to my room to change. During breakfast, in order to not create more wastage than necessary, we told Catherine that we would like eggs without the full english breakfast. She told us it was too busy for her to fulfil our request, yet when we turned to look around, others had their requests fulfilled. The food that was brought over to the table on carts were also of questionable hygiene. As someone who has taken the food hygiene course, food should not be less than 20cm off the ground, yet they put the food on the lower end of the cart, so close to the ground that I had to question their hygiene standards in the kitchen. I would not recommend staying in this hotel if you want to receive good service and good food. Even the prata was cold when it reached the table.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

40,1.0,"Having stayed here several times, the service is on the downfall. The communication is very bad. I had emailed the hotel 4 times and wrote on their FB with no reply on my lost and found item. It's very frustrating. I only get the reply after check in by calling the service hotline. Secondly, regretted my choice of taking up their signature room. The room is so cramp with bulky furniture, black woods, very tiny window and bathroom. Found the table lamp on the floor. Pretty creepy feeling. Not recommended. My last stay in a premier room was amazing. Next, the security is very bad. I had a rude knock on my door at 4am. When i peep to the hole It was friend. He  had return to get his house key left in my room. The receptionist had given him the acess key to my room. I was dumb founded. I did not authorized to give my room key out.

49,4.0,"My wife and I spent our anniversary with them. Overall experience was quite a pleasant one. They even prepared a cake for us for the occasion which we thought it was a pretty nice gesture. Two particular things to point out: 1. We were greeted by Chooi Yen (hope I spelt her name correctly) when checking into the hotel. She is polite and very professional. Took time to explain to us on some queries we had. Got us checked-in to our clean and tidy room ahead of time.2. Our breakfast unfortunately took awhile before they were served and only after reminding the staff of our order. Not even our latte was served prior the the reminder. And they have totally forgotten our cereal + milk and yogurt. (Not served at all) American breakfast set was quite a disappointment. IMO, the Scrambled eggs tasted a bit powdery however their Sunny side up eggs were nicely cooked. We did not kicked-up any fuss over it, as they seem pretty short handed.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
50,1.0,"I made a reservation via Hotel.com platform at this property on 05th Jan for tonight. It is for a very special occasions (18th year wedding anniversary, my daughter passed her O Levels and got admitted to polytechnic and her birthday is actually today - 15th Jan). Prior to our checking in, I made a phone call to the property to request for some special arrangements. I was then informed to make my request thru email to enquiry.ohs@millenniumhotels.com. A lady by the name of Kelly replied to me on 12th Jan about the cakes and pralines as an arrangement (sorry to say but these are so yesteryears. We did that in St Regis in 2014.) So I then called and spoke to Lynn on the same day around 4pm. She said that I would need to reply the email and enquire about the flowers. If I agree then I will have to make the payment via the link provided, which I am totally fine about it. But what annoys me til today is NONE - NOBODY FROM THE GUEST EXPERIENCE TEAM REPLY ME! AND TO ADD SALT TO THE WOUND, UPON CHECK IN, NO ARRANGEMENT OF THAT SORTS AS MENTIONED INSIDE THE EMAIL. HELLOOOO!!!???!!! NOBODY HERE IS WORKING???!!!??? OR THE GUESTS EXPERIENCE TEAM WANTS TO TOTALLY MAKE THE EXPERIENCE A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR GUESTS???!!!??? I made a call and spoke to Darren, whom I believe is the Duty Manager. He tried to pacify me by saying that the arrangements have been made only need to be send to my room. Look - I am working on a 6 days basis. As I am writing, my wife and daughter is enjoying themselves at the swimming pool and me in the room writing this review, when I should be with them!!! All our schedules are packed and I am working on a very tight schedule. Darren offered to send it to me but I declined citing for a few reasons -1) After swimming we will freshen up ourselves and going out for dinner and will be back late. So we will be very full for the cakes and pralines. 2) Tomorrow after breakfast, I need to check out and need to attend a meeting at 1pm. So again, the cakes and pralines are of no use.Darren then make an alternative for my next stay he will make it memorable for me. My replied was how often can you have 3 celebrations in a year??? And also, provided he is still working with the property. He apologise many times but I think it is too late for all this. We then ended our conversation. After 2 minutes he called me back saying that he wants to upgrade me to Club Suite!!! I HAVE DONE MY UNPACKING AND YOU OFFERED ME THAT???!!!??? WHO GONNA DO THE PACKING AND UNPACKING AGAIN FOR US???

When i checked in and opened the curtains there was a sticker hasn’t removed from the window.  There’s a hardened rice on the table. There’s a couple of chips left inside the drawer. Opened tea on the drawer. And when i looked at the peep hole there were tissues inserted in it. I called the reception around 3:45 as soon as i saw these things and told about the situation she informed me that they will get back to us for the room change. We waited and waited we already settled in the room despite the said complaints. They called us for a rooM change around 8:30 having an excuse of they attended another room change. Ofcourse you wouldn’t want to change room anymore when you already settled everything in your room so we decline of changing the rooms already. Instead requested for wine glasses and a knife for the celebration of New Year that night. But to our surprise no wine glasses and knife arrived despite of they knowing that we already have complaints about the room. Cleanliness was not up to standards plus the service. We understand that it’s holiday but you should also think that we also paying high rates to enjoy and celebrate this day. ,Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

Disappointed that the hotel did not share about the renovation of the club lounge when I emailed prior to the stay and also on check-in and we only knew of it when we checked out the club lounge on our own. Due to closure, there is no happy hour for the club guests and we could have just booked for a premium room with no additional cost. ",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

Third time, I tried to call and I wanted to asked info on your breakfast as we wanted to book a table for 4, since my husband loudly mentioned about the lovely experience he had not long ago. The lady on the phone rudely interrupted me and did not help at all. She simply stated ""you need to speak with the cafe"" (not in a nice way, almost like she was fed up or she didn't want to spend time over the phone) and she addressed my call to the cafe without even mentioning to me ""I will put you on hold"" or similar. I would have expected a mininun of courtesy. Very  rude of her to hang up on me without notice. When transferred to the cafe, I spent I don't know how many minutes waiting as nobody picked up the phone. I got fed up and I hung up myself.Thank you for ruining my experience and disappointing us all. We have waited over a year to come and enjoy your breakfast and this is the outcome. Glad we did not book our stay with you as we initially planned. Funny how everyone is crying for money, but people who do want to spend money are rejected with the baddest level of hospitality. Really bad customer service, thank you for making me save money. I trust there are hundreds of good places in Singapore looking for guests.

We went out and collected the keys to the other room when we came back later that evening. The hotel is located at the end of Orchard Road but it is not a very long walk to the main shopping belt. Thankfully, the clubs are not open due to COVID, otherwise, we think there will be a bit of noise on a Friday night.Room is comfortable and clean. It looks newly renovated and modern. TV had lots of channels. Breakfast - you choose the cuisine that you want. The portion is huge so never mind that it wasn't a buffet. Other tables had quite a lot of leftover food, which is a shame as all these will go to waste. The food is good. We had to wait for quite a while for the food to come but that is understandable given the times that we are in. The staff did their best and were friendly.

The management need to improve the flushing system of the toilet bowl, need multiple flushings to clear the waste fully. Handheld shower was dislodged thus water flushing out at the joint when i turn it on. Am surprised that housekeeping staff did not discover that. I managed to fix that myself so i can use it.

69,2.0,"The staff atOrchard Hotel were friendly and approachable. However , the Premium Club room was a let down. My husband n I felt so short change over the amount  we paid for our yacht-cation. It cost us $1750 exclude GST The high tea collection (pic attached ) was ok but the amount given is really ... . In fact , we asked if there was more, the manager in charge came to explain that he actually made a very nice combination for us n that was it. I couldn’t dare to break his heart that the portion was not extravagant . However, I asked for a sandwich which the manager readily obliged with a cheery heart. Dinner at Hua Ting - It was a set dinner. The meat platter and soup were delicious. Following these 2 dishes , it was mediocre. The dessert mango w Pomelo was extremely sweet. It’s like from the can food. However,  the yacht was great ! Guess this is the only thing that console us for the amount we paid but still it’s far too expensive for the whole yatch-cation. It was a nice ride and walk around the islands. Overall, it was not a good experience for my husband and I. We were expecting more for the amount we paid. Lunch for next day was not provided even though we can check out at 6 pm. The premium club room looks run down. Toilet bowl cover was loose. Awful stains along the wall below the mirror.

Never bother about distancing. 10 pax was allowed even before phase 3. This will be forwarded to the relevant department. No one bothers about your concern. Signature deluxe is crap. Even standard stuffs are short. Door security ledge missing. No room make up. Even plates and rubbish out rooms wasn’t clear for 2 days!!! Nothing is make up.

The cakes and pastries were so-so, but i must praised that the staffs were really attentive! The high tea was supposed to serve 4, however they have provided us with 5 sets, considering that our table consisted of 2 adults and 3 kids. We happily returned the extra set to them as the kids don't eat much. The staffs at the swimming pool were very helpful as well. Due to Covid crowd control,  the pool can only accommodate 15 pax based on first come first serve. They have assisted to assign a time slot for us. When I was at the lobby at 8.45 am, there was a long snake queue for breakfast. My sis has booked a grand deluxe room type on the other wing of the hotel, hence i went to check it out. The room was newly renovated,  however do take note that this room type has no bathtub. As far as i know, all kids love playing in bathtub =).When I'm back at the lobby at 10 a.m. the queue for breakfast was still very long.The breakfast suppose to end at 10.30am. I approached the lady in charge and she courtesy replied that they were discussing  internally on how to provide breakfast for all the guests. Eventually, the breakfast was serve at our room at around 11.30am. Despite the heavy crowd, the staffs were very co-operative and composed.My only complain for the stay was the clogged sink and the toilet need multiple flush. The friendly technician assisted us to unclog the sink while i went out for my high-tea.Overall, it was a fabulous staycation, the services of all the hotel staffs made our stay a pleasant one!  Looking forward to visit the hotel again. =)",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

Upon knowing that my husband and I were there for our 21st wedding anniversary, he upgraded us to a club room which was very spacious and comfortable. They even gave us a slice of cake and a card which was very delightful. Overall, it was a great staycation and will definitely visit again!",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

Once the front desk staff told him about my lugguage bag problem, he came with me to my room to sort out the problem immediately. From the moment he stepped into my room until he left was less than 5 minutes. And before he used his tool to helped me to open the lugguage bag, he told me what he is going to do and what kind of precaution I have to take after opening the lock. He is just an expert!!",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
75,4.0,"Stayed at Orchard Hotel over the weekend. Chose this hotel due to its location at Orchard District, so my nieces can experience the nice Christmas Deco along Orchard Road, as well as malls that competes to outdo one another (it is not so apparent compared to decades ago which was a mega Christmas event). Due to the Rediscover voucher issued by Singapore Government, most of the hotels surged in bookings and many were not prepared operationally and logistically causing long queues formed at reception and huge delays. We booked 2 rooms and we arrived slightly earlier but my room wasn't available, fortunately the other one was ready. Soon after, the queue has started to form due to many arrivals on the same day. It was reported that the Registration queue at another hotel at Orchard Area was horrendously long, some were waited for 5-7 hours. We were blessed not to experience that kind of incident otherwise the Staycation will turn into a disappointment. The hotel is quite nice, with a four features bathroom. There were lots of kids due  a few savoury and sweets. No replenishing and re-ordering. Take it or leave it. We prefer other 5 star hotels, where service was better, as well as food options. ",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
76,5.0,"This was a last minute (1 week ago) staycation for stay on 18-19dec 2020. Although there was no pre-booked check in time slot but we were able to check in at 2pm on arrival date. No late check out was granted as the hotel was fully booked. The hotel managed the counter check in situation well with quite a number of staff there ensuring there were no long queues and they will pass us some forms to fill in our particulars first while waiting, so that check in will be faster later on.We were assigned the grand deluxe twin room 1319 at the orchard wing and the recently refurbised room looks really in a good condition. We were spoilt by the number of charging points available, including 4 USB outlets. It was also a pleasant surprise when the hotel staff personally delivered the otters festive christmas hamper to our room shortly after check in. This hamper certainly exceeded our expectation as it was only described as 'christmas goodies giveaway' in the description.As part of our Otters festive adventure package, we were also given $100 dining credit. Note that the dining credit cannot be stacked with discounts, neither can it be used after check out. As we stayed for only 1 night, we used it for dinner at orchard cafe. Due to the holiday peak season, advised to reserve your seats in advance. We ordered from their ala carte menu and we were satisfied. Breakfast seating is on first come first serve basis. Breakfast starts at 6.30am. Generally, there seems to be less crowd before 8pm. We felt that the breakfast buffet choices is limited considering the price of the breakfast buffet. When we dine on 19 dec, they allowed us to approach the buffet counters to order the food and the servers will take the food and give it to us.Check out was fuss free, we just need to deposit the room card in the express check out box. We were also able to obtain a complimentary car park coupon from the staff. Note that currently the link from orchard hotel to claymore connect shopping mall is closed. Guests need to enter claymore connect via the main entrance.Overall, we are very satisfied with our stay at Orchard Hotel. No doubt the hotel exterior seems old, but the newly refurbished room, christmas decorations in the lobby and the staff friendly gestures make up for it. The otters festive adventure package is really value for money especially with SGRediscover voucher. Highly recommended!",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

Very clean and good service but check the bill before check out one chicken rice added to my room service wrongly, but hotel informed me to investigate and reply where went wrong till date no reply Check in process very long becuase of COVOD - 29 situation but automation in check in much much needed",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
78,3.0,"Got the chance to have an overnight staycation here. The room has a green scenery view lookout, without any tall building in front.I believe many people also come here for their bathtub. I just felt it was a bit small but still able to move around in the shower and toilet.Unfortunately the shower water took sometimes to heat up, and you probably waste lots of water while waiting for the hot water.As for the breakfast, because of the pandemic so all are serve in set meal. I ordered the western breakfast but it was served cold, even for the bacon and scrambled egg. Would be good if the food are as least warm.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
79,5.0,"We stayed three nights as a family of four which included two young kids. The room we reserved was a Family Room but we were finally actually given two interconnecting rooms at check-in. That was a nice surprise, and we benefited from the added privacy between adults and kids. There was a king-sized bed in the adults room, and two super-single beds in the kids’ room. The beds were on rollers though, so they shift position fairly easily.We had complimentary parking. For persons who're driving, the turn from Claymore Road into the carpark can be a little hard to miss. Basically, turn from Orchard Road and right after you pass Claymore Connect on your left, turn left right away into the sideroad – the entrance into the Hotel’s basement carpark is about 50 meters away.After the widely-reported hotel check-in difficulties at selected properties downtown, I'm glad to say check-in at Orchard Hotel was smooth - for the most part. Oddly, when I called earlier on to confirm the reservation, I was told that check-in was 2PM despite the booking form stating 3PM. So, we showed up at 2PM, only to be told again that rooms would only be ready at 3PM. It was just as well though, since there was a small queues formed at each of the four check-in rows at 3PM later - but our registration had already completed and hour ago, so we collected our keycards in a jiffy.Our two interconnecting rooms at level 13 were of decent size and clean. There was a large rug where the bed frame was, and light brown parquet tiles for the rest of the flooring. The toilets had a standing shower stall (no rain showerhead though), a good-sized bathtub, and enough surface area around the sink to put our personal toiletries. The room’s mini-fridge was bereft of paid drinks and snacks, but the beverage corner had the usual instant coffee mixes and assorted teas. Our two units were directly facing private apartment blocks though, so the day curtains had to be drawn closed throughout, as I wasn’t sure if the rooms interiors would be visible from the opposing residential blocks.We had no issues with the in-room WIFI nor getting connections on our several mobile devices. As for areas of improvement:Firstly, the rooms were dim and would have benefited from more light sources! The room in the evening and night felt fairly dark that it wasn’t easy to do any serious work or reading. Secondly, the complimentary breakfast was served at the Orchard Cafe, and wasn’t quite where we’d expect from a property that’s currently ranked #23 of 365 in Singapore – none of the four options for mains (Indian, Chinese, Vegetarian, and Western) were particularly memorable taste or presentation-wise. One incident stuck in our mind though: the supervisor at the cafe on our first morning sounded impatient when we had questions about the ordering process. And she even reprimanded one of her waiters right in front of us when they didn’t notice our call for assistance (this was a small thing to us as the cafe was busy that morning). We found the waiter staff actually pleasant on the overall, though it was clear that breakfasts were busy for them.Still, we enjoyed this stay at Orchard Hotel, and have it's an easy recommendation again for family staycationers who want a short stay and don’t want to break the bank either.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5
80,5.0,"Went with the family on a 2D1N yachtcation purchased from the hotel. The package included- 2PM check-in- 2D1N stay in a Premier Suite at Orchard Hotel- 1 Hi-tea- 1 5-course Chinese dinner at Hua Ting- 4-hr Cruise on the Leviathan in Southern Islands- Picnic Lunch- Late check-out at 6PMThe kids enjoyed the experience. After the dinner, we need to walk around Orchard Road to work it off. The cruise to the Southern Islands was very pleasant, and it was surprisingly sunny. The day before and after was drizzling. During the cruise, we had a chance to swim, do some snorkeling (the usual low visibility in Singapor) and kayaking. We departed from the cruise at about 2PM and we had time to chill at the hotel pool before our late check-out. We took a stroll to the nearby Muddy Murphy's Irish Pub for a pint and some bites. Great staycation experience!",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

82,4.0,"The Orchard Hotel is strategically located just at the end of Orchard Road, away from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping street but still well placed a short stroll away from the key shopping foci (e.g. Tangs, Isetan and Marks & Spencers). In the other direction, the glorious pleasures of the Botanic Gardens and Tanglin Mall beckon. Checking in one day after the infamous ""stayqueuetion"" episode, check-in was busy but moving, and staff were very proactive about getting information registered while waiting in the queue. This trend continued throughout the stay - morning breakfast service was busy but staff were pleasant and helpful. The premium signature rooms are located on the top floors of the hotel, and decorated in what looks like traditional Chinese decor, which makes the corridors rather dark. The rooms continue the trend with dark cupboards and black marble tiles, but offset with glowing accents of colour (emerald green paintings, carpets and pleated drapes). In the end, I would say the room is quite cosy with a different ambience from the more modern IKEA style hotel rooms. The only drawback of dark fittings is that it is a struggle to keep spotlessly dust-free, although the housekeeping were obviously doing their best. The room was also aging gracefully with some signs of high use, but nothing too offputting. All mod cons were provided - coffee/tea, BOSE CD player/radio, mini bar and flatscreen TV. Bed comfort was good, if not the luxuriously opulent beds that you get in the more expensive hotels. Breakfast was included, and there were choices of American, Chinese, Chinese vegetarian and Indian. There was more than enough to eat, and quality was again acceptable, if not spectacular (some hits, some misses). Sleep comfort was OK - the main fault being that noise intrudes from neighbouring rooms and corridors, and (although not the hotel's fault), guests were quite inconsiderate and occasionally bordering on rowdy, which made for interrupted sleep. On the last day, there was cigarette smoke in the lift lobby on my floor, which persisted for hours (again, not the hotel's fault - but annoying, nonetheless). Housekeeping was not routinely provided for short stays, but available upon request.Given the current pricing of the hotel, I would say 5 stars for value, but overall 4.5 stars for overall experience.",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

During our stay twas very difficult to reach “Dial 0”. One more thing I understand the pandemic but Gym facility procedure was so troublesome to think that they have they’re own gym receptionist, but you still need to queue at the lobby to get gym access card before you able to use the gym, we, as a guest avoiding the crowd but we still need to queue at the lobby. Another worst thing was, after we check in, I was planning to make a coffee from their mini bar, I was shocked when I saw the mug was already used and there’s a coffee stain in it with the teaspoon I hope they will improve it after all the issue of pandemic.

99,2.0,"Stayed here for quarantine, would not recommend for anything, and especially not staycations. Totally does not look like pictures! I've stayed in a lot of hotels the last 2 months and this was by far the worst. Even smaller than what I stayed in in Europe (does not even have a sofa! I felt quite claustrophobic being in there 2 weeks) and room is dated in spite of supposed recent refurbishment. I suspect they included the size of the long corridor in the room size, but it's not like anyone hangs out in the corridor. If anything it's an inconvenience.  Toilet smelled even on day 1. AC does not go above 25C so if you're cold you have no choice. Asked for help, they sent a technician down who told me switch on all the lights, as light emits heat... seriously... Front desk doesn't always pick up. Lunch is served late at like 230pm or 830pm, usually I just order because I can't wait so long. I think the only advantage is that its cheaper than other hotels in the area, but since it seems quarantine guests are paying above average room rate and don't have a choice we are kind of stuck, but I suppose that's a unique situation. This quarantine experience at Orchard Hotel made a very poor end to everything and I hope they stop placing people here as quarantine is already an unpleasant experience. I do think people would pay more for a nicer hotel. I would. Plus sides are staff are polite and restaurant food is pretty good. I guess I would call this hotel a budget choice if you're a tourist wanting to be in a hotel in Orchard, personally not anywhere I'd stay willingly. ",Orchard Hotel Singapore,4.5

2,2.0,"So, I've looked up the reviews before choosing to go with Fullerton this time for a friend's birthday celebration. However, I was disappointed and would not return again. Here's why:1. Prearrival - received email 5 days in advance to fill out a form. Filled out the form and responded to the email to inquire hi-tea and cocktail timing as I will be celebrating my friend's birthday and need to do some planning. Was forwarded to the straits club mgr to answer the hi-tea and cocktail timing, only. 2. Arrival - ID with date of birth was given upon check in but also no recognition. 3. Room is old, facing the insides of the hotel with minimum amenities. Understand it's COVID and you trying to go green but not sure if that is luxury - when you need the guest to call and request for basic amenities (e.g. Comb, cotton bud, etc.) Later on when we asked for the cotton buds, then we realised that it comes with the vanity kit (with cotton pad and nail file) which means, the vanity kit in the room when we checked-in (missing cotton buds) are left from the previous guest?4.  Food served at hi-tea and cocktail was meh. Not worth going for seconds. 5. Chandon breakfast - Again, not recognised or asked if we would like Chandon. Only when asked and after checking, then was there Chandon served. Saving grace was that the breakfast spread is actually tasty but not enough to get me back again. We don't expect complimentary gifts or cake but guest recognition is clearly non-existent in Fullerton.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

Ben led his team effectively and was able to ensure that everything was executed according to plan even though we made multiple last minute changes. Not only did Ben perform his role exceptionally, he was also a very reassuring and calming presence during the whole event and especially before our march-ins.

We both knew the hotel quite well and we have visited this historic building numerous times. This place hold special meaning in our hearts. This will be our first staycation since the pandemic. As we are all at the mercy of the virus, the hotel lobby look a little different. Sofas and lobby chairs were sparsely located adhering to the safe distancing measures. Shields were put up at the concierge and reception counters. We were checked in by Nicholas at the reception. He explained very clearly and politely that we would need to book for breakfast slot, gym and pool times.We were pleasantly greeted by Roszel who Congratulate us on our wedding anniversary and thank us for choosing the hotel. He was very professional and well- mannered. He escorted us to our room and to our big surprise, we were given a generous upgrade. He introduced the suite and orientate us, where we had a little balcony which we later spend many hours “chilling” outside watching sunrise and sunset. The hotel got us a bottle of wine and a chocolate cake. Housekeeping decorated our bed with petals and balloons. Roszel also offered us to have cocktails at the Straits Club, where we then met cheerful Paulo. We ordered Room Service for lunch however food was a little disappointing. I had the Club Sandwich (which only had a slice of thin chicken considering the price - $31) and hubby has the Seafood flat noodles but since the hotel had put so much effort in taking care of our reservation, we choose to overlook the matter. The next 2 nights went very smoothly. Overall, the feeling of having the hotel pampering us with little thoughts put into it, made us feel truly important. We sincerely appreciate the effort that was invested to make our wedding anniversary a memorable one and hence the food experience hiccup became insignificant and forgivable. Despite the pandemic and probably running on lean manpower, Roszel and team has created an unforgettable stay for us. Thank you Fullerton Hotel!

He showed us the best locations in the hotel to take our wedding photographs as well! From then on I have told all my family members or friends who book the Fullerton hotel to look for him for assistance. All of them have gotten back to me saying that he has taken care of them very well and they are very thankful for his service. A huge thank you to Prabu and all the staff at Fullerton. My family and I will definitely come back to Fullerton and stay there for longer in our next visit.,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
12,5.0,Came for a staycation for the 3rd time with Fullerton as we had our wedding 5 years ago here. Service is still so impeccable! Had a great high tea at courtyard and was causally speaking to Mr Lilakumar that we had our wedding here n he promptly went to ask the rooms team for a room upgrade for us. We are so touched with the extra mile to make our stay an even more memorable one in this hotel that holds so much dear memories for both my husband and I. No doubt still the best hotel in our view. Thanks to the Fullerton team for giving us a very warm n sincere service! It feels like home ,The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
13,2.0,"Last time we visited Fullerton in Feb 2020 and we were impressed by the quality of services and particular staff.This time, in April 2021, we stay in a Palladian Suite for a 2 days staycation and we had a negative experience overall:1. The Fullerton is the only hotel which didn't send a pre-arrival email to book slots for pool, breakfast, checkin, restaurants, etc. 2. Checkin was a mess, we needed to wait about 30-40 minutes, everything was very slow. 3. The checkin staff insisted that we can book slots for pool, gym, etc by calling them from room, he didn't really want to assist and he tried to expedite. No info about nothing, restaurants, spa, etc. It was fun that he told us that he will upgrade to a palladian suite, which was actually the suite that we paid for.4. The room was not very clean - it could use some vacuum cleaner and we called the housekeeping to clean the toilet - although we did checkin 10 min before, they insisted the toilet was not like that before. 5. The pool slots are non existent, you can actually go there whenever you want. 6. The straits club service was much worse than it used to be. Once the staff bring some food, the first thing they will say is: ""there is only one serving"". Not only that guests cannot ask for an extra sandwich or whatever, but never encountered this in another hotel club lounge in Singapore. Same for drinks - they have some terrible wine, tiger beer and 2 cocktails. The club has only 1,5h service in the evenings. ",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
14,2.0,"My family decided to have a one-night staycation at the Fullerton hotel in April. Booked one night shortly after spending two nights at MBS. This package was recommended to us by AMEX Platinum travel service which includes a high-tea, evening cocktails and Chandon breakfast.Initial check-in impression and the room are all fine, no major issues. The real issue with us is around the high-tea and evening cocktail. The key issue and source of our disappointment is around the clarity of the service level/offering and the attitude of one particular service staff. During the high-tea, the aforesaid staff told us that this is not a buffet-style high-tea but they can allow us to ask for more sandwiches and scones. No further top-ups for the macaroons and cakes. Got the second serving of sandwiches; but when we asked for the third serving, we were told that we can’t have the third serving by this particular staff. Other staffs are more accommodating and gave us the third serving. Not a very pleasant experience...Few hours later, went back to the same place for evening cocktails and encountered the same problem again with the same staff. When the food arrived, we asked for two extra servings of pasta for my son. Again, the same staff told us that we need to finish our food first before he can bring us more food. This time, we told another staff that we are willing to pay extra for the food. Again, we were told by the other staff not to spend additional money and they will bring the pasta to us. Apparently spring rolls are apparently plentiful and they gave us second and third servings. We eventually waited for 40 min. before the second servings of pasta arrived and my 9-yr old son was visibly hungry. Definitely not a good experience. If you see the attached pasta photo, it shouldn’t take more than 10-15 min. for the kitchen staff to prepare a new batch.My suggestions to the management of the Fullerton Hotel and its sister hotels, as well as Amex Platinum Travel Service: 1. I understand that you want to lower your food costs and wastage. However, I think you pushed it too far. I stayed at Barrack hotel and a colleague of mine recently stayed at the Clan hotel and experienced the same issue. He went outside for second helpings after eating breakfast at the hotel.In addition, your vague policy has put us in a difficult position whereby we are being forced to finish most if not all the food first before second helping/serving is given; even when we offer to pay for the extra food. I’m sorry, I’m no longer in grade school where I’m forced to eat my carrot and peas. As a customer, I have the right to choose what I want to eat and when I want to eat it. Thanks to your service, my wife felt that she’s being treated as a “beggar” where we need to “beg” for our food.2. Amex, you really should think strategically about the hotel Brand’s and chains you partnered with. Your recommendations are taken as an endorsement of a certain level of expectation and experience. This partner hotel of yours have certainly failed to deliver.3. Thumbs up to Noorsih and Andrew at the lounge for trying their hardest to salvage the situation by providing an impeccable service level. We appreciate the extra glasses of Chandon and food!4. The aforementioned staff is a Les Clef D’or member. I’m sorry sir, I believe your conduct today does not reflect well on the thousands of the Golden Key members that strives their hardest every day to deliver an impeccable service to their customers. 5. My suggestion to Fullerton is to adopt a buffet-style high-tea. To reduce food wastage, put it in a cart and allow the customers to pick what they want. We had an amazing experience at MBS high-tea buffet.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

We had a great time by the pool thanks to Sall, the outstanding pool attendant who makes sure you have all you need to relax. This may be not the largest pool in Singapore but, overlooking the Singapore river, with Sall taking care of you, we did have a wonderful time. ",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

Afternoon tea and cocktail sessions were ok, not the semi buffet style but tea set. most of the staff members there were friendly . food was not as good as we expected from a 5 stars hotel. We didn't like the room as there was a big pillar blocking 90% of view.. Curtains were a bit dusty,  could see the dusts flying in air under the ceiling lights.. Shower was not hot enough for our liking. Pool was ok but not big,  still worth a visit to see the nice view.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
22,5.0,"Thank you Fullerton team for taking care of us. Rafi guided us to wait for check in. It was surprisingly busy but their Q management was superb. Mira is so sweet. Assisted my partner and I swiftly for check in. She is very detailed and went through our benefits thoroughly. Our room came with club benefits hence after check in - we proceeded to the club lounge, served by Norish who is polite and graceful. Unfazed by the crowd, the club team did such a good job ensuring that all their guests were taken care off. My partner and I were also very amazed by Mr Roszel. Firstly we met him at the lobby assisting check in. The next time we saw him at the lounge during evening cocktail, serving guests, making the effort to know all his guests and even took the time to speak to us. We felt really well taken care of. As for the room - it is meticulously well maintained and of course being a heritage hotel - the decor is old school but that is where the beauty lies. The bed is so comfortable! My partner and I are very pleased and felt very recharged which is the main purpose of the stay. Kudos for the Fullerton team (i am sorry i could only name a few) & their passion in their job. Thank you for all that you do and please stay safe! ",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
23,5.0,"Every accommodation is made up by a team of people to make the place special !! This place has such a great view and facilities to offer however it wasn’t that which makes me leave the hotel at the end of the stay feeling heavy hearted !! It was the staff !! There are so many small detailing that I have observed that every each one of the staff in this hotel would make sure they do their very best to make sure you feel like home . One of my best favorite was uncle Toh Heng who most of the time under the hot sun making sure everyone gotten their towels and water by the pool yet so smiley :) !! What is unbelievable consistently that I would like the world to know about is our care taker Miss Olivia !! Traveling the world encountered with many care takers there is something very special about this girl that make her stands out from most in the world!! Well Done for keeping the hotel image to the highest level !! I can also never thank you enough to Ida, Sivan, Kumar and the brassiere team, Ummar, Rhea, Julian, Vanessa, Michelle, Thong, Asenth, 3 boys at the front arrival that I promise to make an extra effort to continue memorizing your names in my future visit , Uncle Toh Heng and another uncle that we met who bring us water and towels in the gym .... All the best to all of you , may god bless you all to be healthy and safe always and you will always be my preferred hotel !!! ",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
24,4.0,"My entire 4 stars go towards Warren Naluz Claudia and the Fullerton team, including the Indonesian Lady (Powder Room), all concierge, some men in suits who i presume are from upper management who bothers to greet guests at 9 in the morning. A small exception would be this short hair lady who only greets her specific guests/client/corporate people.-1 star because the management took it away from the staff. Severely understaffed.Every other component is a 0.*advise that all guests lower their expectation to avoid disappointment and management to take this review very seriously*Breakfast: (basically this is where if there was a negative review function i would employ)I saw a european family basically gagging, im sure your executive board or upper management is definitely made up of some Caucasians, please let them undercover boss the breakfast, they will gag. Waffles taste like kids playdough. Need I say more? Economical fried beehoon disguised as 'wok-fried vermicelli' i give credit to whoever who came up with this, I. clap. for. you. had a  good laugh. Porridge, i have to quote Gordon Ramsay and say that both the chicken and seafood were rubbery. Almost everything at breakfast was Not prepared in-house, so so blatantly obvious, in fact I can tell you that the guacamole tastes EXACTLY like Avofresh which can be bought from Coldstorage. Waffles confirm NOT made in-house, dim sum looked colourless, like deadfish, eh no those like food in the display case that has lost its colour from lighting. (go to yi dian xin or imperial treasure,  its like night and day) I dont think you need a customer to teach you that the eyes eat first. Fried chicken that accompanied a few dishes such as the aforementioned vermicelli, taste so stale, like it was made a few days ago.The only 2 dishes, from the breakfast that purportedly costs/is worth 49$, the laksa and the rice of the nasi lemak(ok fine sambal can eat) were decent, but thats all, coffee very diluted, did i mention that the wait time is like 20-30mins? Ala carte order from staff. They give you some delifrance-esque bread/pastry basket to wait in the meantime. 49$ for entertainment for how disgusting your food is, hmm not even worth it. Basically breakfast was largely inedible.Tried basically almost(didn't try the muesli) the full breakfast menu but seriously, it was underwhelming.Check-In:Check-in too about 30mins to 1hr, YES THATS RIGHT. THE FAMILY BESIDE ME WAITED 1 HOUR TO CHECK INTO FULLERTON.To add injury to insult after waiting to long, they give you a goddam teddybear and expect you to light up or smile or something. Is this a childcare?  Honestly just leave it in the room as a *surprise*  also, most of us have bags to carry, we dont need an additional promotional bear for the moment.After finding out more, realised it as because they are severely understaffed, don't blame them, blame the upper management/hr , the staff probably has, poor promotion/renumeration. How to retain quality staff???? Also, can try to anticipate if you have a hike in bookings/popular periods right? first day ah? At least courteously inform your guests the day before to expect a long waiting time, minimum right??? or email/all up your guests and offer them maybe a staggered/earlier check time to ease the queue and load on staff? seriously do i need to teach you this radical new concept????? You can ask/remind your guests to do the pre-arrival stuff(book gym/pool) while waiting.Honestly after learning more from the concierge/general staff, i feel damn bad for the staff. Special shoutout to Warren Naluz, Claudia and entrance(red carpet) staff. I hope all of you get a promotion/pay increase 24month bonus yall deserve it, really top notch service. Top-Notch service from Warren Naluz, hope he is part of the Golden Keys. Please nominate him.Room: Pass, just basic everything there lor other than that nothing much, can say that they lack attention to detail, disappointing for Fullerton, see attached picture. Don't expect anything unless you book a 4-figure per night room.Construction work on the 2nd floor lasted for about 1 hr, say goodbye to after-breakfast naps, was staying on the 4th floor. Again, thanks for the entertainment because I thought to myself, WHAT A JOKE FULLERTON. No notice/Letting your guests know, would have been nice? YA?Pool:  Safety hazard, visited a few times and on ALL occasion, the steps were very wet, if you have elderly/fragile/clumsy/children PLEASE DO NOT RUN. 8am/9am, 12pm/6pm the steps leading towards the pool were dripping wet. Workplace and guest safety issue obvi. Please do not wear the hotel slippers there.Pros: Bathrobe was good, luxuriously soft material. Near Asian Civilisation museum if you need to dump your kids somewhere.TLDR: NO Fullerton magic or experience, its basically any other hotel. What a shame because it is such an iconic location and building. SIGH. Please go elsewhere for breakfast. Before they fix these issues I suggest you re-discover sg elsewhere. It isn't something that the CS(Customer Service) team can do/enhance, i think problem lies with management/board/execs.Learn to balance your international clientele with the local one, form what i can see, you're not trying at all.(except your ground operation staff) hotline staff terrible, say call back but dont call back, any remarks you've left for them to convey are pointless, it is not followed through.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

28,3.0,"Pre-Arrival was promising with the pre arrival email for facilities booking so as the 11am early check in offer which we declined as we were working that Wednesday. Check into a courtyard room that we initially booked at 5pm on a Wednesday 24th March. We were given into a room (not going to mention the number) which there was a table and 2 chairs outside the window with people looking in. It would be nice if there were like fake plants instead or given to another courtyard room with a little bit of privacy where nobody could stand directly outside the window looking in. We decided to change our room and we decided why not spend a little more for an upgrade to the marina bay view instead which is so much worth it. Room was not ready as we were shown into a room that was under rectification. However we were glad that when we came back after our plans, that was not the room that was given to us. Although there was an incident the next morning where we got locked inside and waited awhile which we totally understand it was busy but there was no follow up on the incident.Product wise, the room is nice and comfy although a little lack of amenities unlike other 5 star hotels such as One Farrer, Hilton, Conrad and Four Seasons that we previously stayed. Room cleanliness by the Housekeeping was spot on although they do not really top up the bath amenities the second day. Service wise could be improved as we do encounter where our call was transferred but takes awhile to answer. Staff (probably someone covering at the pool/gym counter as it was a different uniform) could be a little more helpful when we wanted to do a booking for a slot at the pool but requested us to call the operator instead. The operator wise have always been helpful throughout our stay although we have to wait but she did help us check and get back to us later. Departure was fast despite the queue however concierge manning could be improve or at least someone from the reception counter could assist as there were people waiting at the concierge when the reception was free of guests. Nonetheless overall, the stay was nice thanks to the stunning view of the Marina Bay View which have the sunrise view if the weather is nice. And shoutout to the experiences tours offered during our stay, Mr Jagjit from the Monument Tour and Uncle Joe from the farm tour was the highlight for us. The lady at the confectionery counter was also helpful recommending which bake goods to try. Not sure if we would be back but maybe would try to go to Fullerton Bay instead since we been there as guests before and the service was much better. ",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

41,5.0,"My husband and I bought this staycation voucher last year June2020. We were so excited that we needed to do a video of our way to this #1 Luxury Hotel in Singapore. ( by the way it is our first time) As we normally travel outside but since we can’t, so why not?!:)Lets start with Concierge:The staff did helped us (with luggage)and welcomed us soon as we arrived. Apologies that I didn’t get their name but I will be posting their photos here:)Front Office:MIRA took care of our check in, very well delivered and confidently explained every single information that we needed to know. She even stepped out to send us to the lift. Room:It was spotless clean, bed was tidy enough that we didn’t even jumped on till bed time. Well we made use of the chaise lounge couch instead. Moving forward, we were expecting of a complimentary masks or sanitizers atleast which most of the hotel does instead it is chargeable which is a no big deal for us as we always have an extra. Hmmm, the view I can’t comment anything at all we didnt like it as it was facing the road and there were construction going on one side which we can’t spend much at the balcony. Another hiccup was there’s one spotlight flickering, though it’s annoying and irritating but we didn’t care. We just don’t like to make it a big issue(who cares) knowing that we worked at the same industry. Evening Cocktail at Straits Club:Moment we stepped in, we were amazed by the set up and the high tea tier that was served to us. Service with elegance amazed us all the time( always looking forward to it), Apologies that I didn’t get the name of the lady who seated and served us. The ambience is just so peaceful and quiet( except the group behind us who were talking and laughing so loud and being greedy with the drinks cause its a”last order”) Birthday Dinner at La Brasserie:The hostess didn’t give much eye contact with us right when we arrived(i don’t like it)I remember I requested a table with a view since we were celebrating a birthday and a first time visit but instead we got one table by the wall. Hostess are supposed to show/guide us with the menu, however we were just only seated by the hostess and said nothing. We were sitting for about half an hour when one staff (Idrus)came to take our order and I did told him that we didn’t get a menu yet and only to find out that a menu is just behind the drinks menu.( by the way, their menus are disposable placemats) Hostess tasks failed to explain to us. It’s embarassing on our side because we were just siting and talking to each other, staff walked passed us and no one has ever approach neither ask us for some drink. Moving forward, we were served by Idrus, he was so patient enough to wait and gave us some recommendation which is what we ordered. Beef Cheek was perfectly done, never had a good beef cheek before but this one was sumptuous. Lobster Roll is simply creamy. I can say, they are so generous with the lobster. We were striving so hard to finish up as we were full from Club High Tea, but yes we did managed to finished up. Now what I loved the most is how they made it memorable, though in the end they gave us some complimentary dessert, small cake and coffee/tea I do apprecite the kindness. We even got a photo and printed it for us.Sweet memories️Back to Room:We received some birthday surprise amenities for my husband. Thank you RoszelBreakfast at Town Restaurant:We were greeted by Kimberly, Yam Shou & Cherry with a smile at 8.30 am. We chose to be seated outdoors for some relaxing, peaceful breakfast. We were given a fruit platter, a bread basket and offered a coffee/tea to start with. (pleasant service). We started with eggs, next we tried their laksa and nasi lemak. It was super good that I am so tempted to order another bowl however I wanted to try their pancakes which is super fluffy. Service was awesome, everyone are super friendly. Nicholas is so kind to offer us another drinks, Wendy is so hardworking to clear and make sure our table has well cleaned. Steve had a chat with us talked about food in Penang. Then there’s Uncle Ronny who had so much energy to ensure everyone leaves happy and with a smile(he’s really fun). And lastly, again the experience didn’t end that. We were given a complimentary cake for my husband even though it was already passed one day, they sang for him and again a photo of memory. Ahh, that was really a very good way to start our day.Pool Time:We made two booking, 1 on the day of arrival to catch the sunset and 2nd on the day of check out in morning to catch the sunlight for sun tanning(but the sun is too shy to come out). I must say, pool booking is the best way to have a quiet and relaxing day for swimming and enjoying the sun and view. Wht I lived most about in the pool is when UncRoom Service after Lunch:We decided to have our Lunch in the room. Menu choices nothing much to choose so we ended up with pasta. The response was fast, delivered on time and we had a good in room lunch servuce.Check out:Fast and smooth. Everything went well.Thanks to Nicholas.Lastly, Reservation Team:To all who assisted me and patiently replying all my queries, thanks to Kate, Mira, Azura,Shamira and the whole team.I must say, it was a memorable birthday staycation with an impeccable service in an elegance style.

The rate inclusions are:Complimentary upgrade to Heritage Room (from Premium Courtyard)Breakfast for 2pax$100 dining credits per stayPre-arrival – I received my email 5 days prior to my stay and it requires you to complete their online form. The email also listing some activities (both paid and complimentary) which you want to consider as an in-house guest.Hotel Interiors – Its been a while since I stepped into Fullerton and I forgot how nice the interior actually is. The hardware seems very well maintained and I can see where the ‘luxury’ banner comes from.Check In – The front desk area was surprisingly occupied at 1230pm on a weekday afternoon – I was lucky to snag an available counter before a small line formed behind me. I was not ushered to the sitting area to be checked-in as other reports say and the process took a good 15mins with the various formalities.I was given an option of an un-refurbished room with marina views or a refurbished room with courtyard room – I picked the new room of course as the old rooms are bleh. I didn’t get the upgrade to Heritage room for some reason and it was never mentioned as well so I didn’t push it since I was only there for 1 night. I was also granted a late check out of 3pm upon asking.I was also impressed that they kept their data long enough (16years!) to know I was a return guest. The good impression didn’t last long though.It was only later when I returned from work that I recalled that my I Prefer elites are supposed to get upgraded upon availability and also a welcome amenity. So I trotted over to the front desk again at 5:30pm to ask about them – and got ……polite nonchalance.Without any acknowledgement that the elite benefits should have been proactively offered, but now clearly missing, and no apologies, the staff said he’ll check if there are any available rooms. After 1 min of cursory tapping, he politely said “sorry mdm all the higher tier rooms are fully booked”.[At this point, the hotel website was showing availability for Heritage, Quay, and Marina Bay View Rooms. Plus Suites]Room – Premium Courtyard Room (42SqM) with Atrium View, Room 316, was actually quite nice. A very nice update from the older version indeed! The dreary yellow brown tones have been replaced by soothing pastel colors and newish brown tones. The King bed is super cushy and accompanied by hanging bedside lamps which I quite liked.The circular work desk and work chair did quite a good job for my WFH except for the fact that the powerpoints were located kind of hidden at the bottom of the TV console which took abit of finding.The mini bar was actually fitted out unlike the mini bars I’ve seen so far – prices are viewable on the Samsung table at the TV area. Speaking of which, the in-room Samsung tablet is supposed to replace the typical info booklet with in-room dining menu, restaurant menus, etc. However, mine has issues with non functioning tabs and pdf menus which turned out to be blank pages. Had to call for assistance and they sent a junior staff to come see the issue, then his supervisor to come and see it again + made a call, then he bought it away to ‘fix it’ and thereafter replaced it with a working one but that too hanged after a while. So I gave up.The bathroom didn’t look too refurbished but completely adequate with a sink, bathtub (a tick for some), separate shower and toilet (have bidet!). Toiletries are Atkinsons Amber Empire which was quite nice!Bfast at Town - My orders were quickly taken and served a bread basket and a good strong black coffee soon. Unfortunately, the food was barely functional – the scrambled eggs were definitely not made-to-order and the sausages were crappy. So I mostly ate the bacon. You can order unlimited mains so I tried dim sum too but they were mushy and bland.Facilities – I went back to peek at the pool and gym (bookings are required) – both located on level 2 but be prepared for a meandering stroll through the corridors depending on which lift you take. Didn’t manage to check out the spa but was told they have steam room and sauna facilities.Service – Housekeeping requests took a while to be fulfilled, though in-room dining came within 30mins. But I do have issues with the lack of Elite recognition and the lack of apology for missing them. If the property doesn’t want to fulfil benefits for their top tier members, then why participate in the first place and create expectations? Also, I noticed a couple of mattresses along the corridor when I arrived, and they were STILL there the next morning. I wonder if they can air their mattresses somewhere else instead of right outside a guest’s door? They make the corridor look so untidy and honestly I wondered if they were clean ones. Ugh. I later called to ask why and was told that the one right outside my door is an extra bed for a guest who is checking in after me.But….. why can’t this wait until AFTER I leave? I mean, it doesn’t exactly make me feel very welcome if you are already preparing for the next guest on my day of arrival.The Duty Manager later called to ask for feedback and he gave me the same spill about the room upgrades being subject to availability. But but but…they WERE available? In any case, he did also confirm what I was told about the mattresses were not true and granted me a late check out til 5pm for my inconvenience. He also offered to upgrade me to a Quay Room the next time I return. I was honest and said I will find it hard to want to return but thanked him for the offer and will keep it in mind.Eventually, before I left, I saw they had moved the mattress right outside my door…..to the next door where an existing mattress was. So now some random guest has TWO mattresses outside HIS/HER door.In summary,a nice room and I do like the whole heritage flair thingy and I wished there were more to make me give this property a pass but alas, there is nothing else about my experience which will make me want to return.Basic staycation expectations aside, the non-existent elite recognition is really sad. It feels like the hotel doesn’t really care about guest experience and running on the fact that their ‘heritage’ reputation is enough.It is not.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

I’m not sure what suite we had but it was done up very tastefully in a distinctly old-world, heritage style, spacious and had a balcony with stunning views overlooking the Singapore river, CBD & museum district. The pool, although small, also afforded a great view and is gorgeously lit up at night.The staff were also very helpful when it came to my dietary restrictions (gluten free) and prepared a selection of GF pastries/snacks at the lounge.

51,5.0,"Decided to take some time off for a quick 2D1N Staycation with the hubby and I must say that this was definitely the best decision ever! The attention to detail, the service, the quality was simple spectacular. Check in was a breeze and Warren is simply the nicest front office personnel I have ever dealt with. He was courteous, friendly and checked us in really quickly! I had a small little issue but Warren really went above and beyond to sort it out in under 2 hours. That is pure class and passion! The room is squeaky clean and the bed is super comfy. I think the housekeepers must have placed a lot of love in ensuring everything was set nicely. We also had dinner there and we met Lalikumar. The food was great and I must point out how they cared for the smallest of details - when our drinks arrived, they asked which drink belong to who and they served the lady first which is something only fine establishments abide by. Also, food was always served simultaneously so that both parties are able to enjoy their meal at the same time (this was also apparent at breakfast). Its these little things that really provides and exceptional experience . Lalikumar even shared he has been in this industry for 29 years - he is a real gem and so is his team! All in all, best staycation ever and I can't wait to come back again! Highly recommended for couples!",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

Most favourite part for me is the electric toilet seat (warm seat and bidet) and the swimming pool (warm nice water temperature).Special thanks and compliments to Justin, Kate (Front Office), Arianne (Cake Boutique), Ling (In-Room Dining), Mayang for giving us a service from the heart.

When our rooms weren't ready, she immediately suggested we could be ushered to a private room to wait. And when we suggested going for a quick bite at Town, she immediately took the initiative and went the extra mile to place a reservation for us.I was particularly impressed by how she single-handedly handled our luggage to be placed in their holding area without waiting for another colleague to help her. She was so hands-on and attentive to every detail and made the entire experience just absolutely fabulous and welcoming.

The savouries were pretty good... but the sweets, too sweet. So if u have a sweet tooth, go for it.:) the service is impeccable.. the servers were attentive and detailed, proactively asked if we would like a group photo.. if our teas needed refilling.. would we like other items. They were so sweet, giving us a slice of a dark ganache cake & printing our our photo for a birthday card. Super awww... :) they were also considerate in their attention and not hover around us. I liked that.Later that evening... i received another cake n a card signed off by the GM as well. Super appreciative and thankful that the guys at Fullerton took the time, effort & heart.

They offered an early check-in as early as 9AM.  Unfortunately, we were not able to come early.  We reached the hotel before 3PM.  Everyone in the hotel is very warm and accommodating.    Our check-in and check-out were done by Kate Reyes.  Since we were not able to avail the early check-in, she accommodated our request for late check out.  She happily assisted us on both transactions, very professional and courteous.  The hotel room is well-maintained.  It is facing the street but we had a good sleep all throughout our stay.

59,1.0,"1) I booked through KKday and requested for a rollaway bed. Was told I have to request at checkin and subject to availability. Then at checkin was told that I should have pre booked the rollaway and that all the rollaway are taken. Stressful start to our holiday. 2) was told the only slot available for breakfast is at 730am. No sleeping in then I guess. 3) was told you have to book pool slots and it's only available at 7am or 1130am which either clashes with breakfast or checkout. 4) our $100 dining voucher had a whole bunch of conditions and couldn't be used for the afternoon tea along with a whole long list of other things... we could use it for in-room dining but it wasn't enough to cover a meal for 3 as its very overpriced. If I had known it would be like this, I'd have been happier just to stay at home We had a much more pleasant hotel stay at Four Seasons in December before Christmas. This is our first and last stay at this place.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
60,5.0,"Stayed with my family during the CNY period back in Feb. Grand CNY decors were observed from the exteriors to the interiors, with complimentary oranges gift bag per room. These gave a great festive feel. The front desk proactively arranged our rooms to be located on the same floor and near each other when they knew we are from the same family, despite different bookings. The day before check-in, a staff called to inform on the early check-in time to avoid check-in crowd, as such check-in was swift without a long queue. Service on the whole is excellent and personalized. Our bookings came with F&B vouchers so we chose to utilize it at Town Restaurant over dinner, which was good. Breakfast came with a good variety of choices, overall the dishes are pretty acceptable although the laksa was lacklustre. Overheard a table nearby complaining that the food was not good compared to pre-covid which the staff handled pretty well, from my point of view it goes the same for other 5-star hotels and the drop of prices, of course that doesn't mean there is no room for improvement. All in all, I would say it was a good decision to choose Fullerton as a staycation destination over CNY.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5
61,5.0,"Checking in was a breeze. The staff answered all my questions and doubts. Shoe shine and ice bucket was provided when requested. Although there was no pillow menu when it says that the room has it. As for the room, It is clean and nice. My only problem is that the tv was not really working. The remote or tv has some sort of problem and we could watch anything except for the introduction page. The use of the compendium tablet was also good and easy and provided many useful info. As for the facilities, we only went to the pool which we had to make a booking for the timing slot. Once arrived at the pool they provided towels. The staff at the pool ensured that the pool temperature was perfect and also provided boxed alkaline water which was great and I am thankful. As for breakfast, Food was great only exception is that I found hair in my pancakes. All in all I loved the vibe and service, It really is the 5 star hotel",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

My stay was simply delightful and there wasn't any problems throughout my check in till my check out period. The room that i had was super cozy and had that luxurious feel. The bathtub was one of the highlight of the hotel, spacious and relaxing. The other highlight would be the view, although partially blocked by a building, i still had a good view to enjoy during the day and night.And that was just the hotel room. The service was absolutely amazing too. Hotel staffs were friendly and helpful and i couldn't think of anything negative to say about them. Mira from Reception made sure that i had everything that i needed for the stay.  Hafiz from Concierge was another splendid soul who catered to my questions when i was in doubt. They made sure to also asked me if there is anything else that i needed to make my stay more pleasant or if i had any feedbacks during my stay.

Unparalleled hospitality was shown to us by a team of staff that demonstrated genuine care and concern for their guests' well-being and doing so with admirable well-oiled teamwork and polished efficiency. From reservation, to check-in, to housekeeping and concierge services, to check-out, the entire experience was seamlessly and delightfully orchestrated by a team of dedicated and experienced staff comprising team members such as Mira, Kate, Warren, Candy, Rafi, Justin, Prabu, Warti, Wei Lun, Alan, Rey, Nisha and course the unforgettable affable Straits Club team led by Nicholas and Siti with Paolo, Aldin and countless others.

From the housekeepers, front desk to the cake shop, all of them were always on their smiles. For a hotel that has been there for decades and an iconic landmark of sg, it is well maintained, clean and rooms were spacious. We stayed 3 night in both palladian and fullerton suite which we had a wonderful time. Will definitely make it a yearly event for us for our anniversary.Only downside will be their straits club access breakfast. It was busy and they were understaffed. Waited long for breakfast and by then, staff came by to inform that was the last order whereby we had yet to start our meal.

We had lunch at Jade and the service and food were generally good, but some dishes were far too salty for our liking. It would have been better if the staff could take initiative to ask how the food was.We had some issues with neighbours making excessive noise in the middle of the night but the duty manager, Mr Andrew was quick to resolve it and came personally to ensure the issue does not reoccur. Late check out was given due to the issue at night and the duty manager, Ms Revathy came during our check out to apologise for the noise the previous night which was no fault of the hotel but rather the inconsiderate guests.

The breakfast was at lobby area (Town) which served many local foods. We had ordered Nasi Lemak with aromatic coconut rice, ikan bilis, chicken drumstick and good chilli.

We arrived earlier than the standard check-in time (at around 1pm), fully aware that we might not be able to check-in and were completely willing to leave our bags until the check-in time. To our surprise and complete delight, the staff at the reception was very prompt in apologising that while our previously assigned city view room wasn't ready (he certainly didn't need to since we came early), there was another room that we could check in to and apologising once again that the view didn't have a city view - something we certainly didn't mind. Upon entering the room, we were completely delighted to discover a gem of the room - it was spacious and had a great view of the Singapore River and the ACM directly opposite. A side window in the room overlooked the pool area. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised and delighted with the room, especially since it provided us with beautiful views both day and night. The room was beautifully appointed and as someone who is almost pedantic about cleanliness, much of the room and the toilet is very much up to my standards.  The only thing was that the Bluetooth speaker in the room was a bit dusty and even after I wiped it, it was still a bit of a dust collector as the surface was rather sticky. Thankfully it wasn't that much of a problem since none of my allergies were affected. All in all, my friend and I had a wonderful experience, from the beautifully appointed room to the great and warm service from the staff at the Fullerton. 15/10 would stay again.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

81,5.0,"Went with my partner. We checked in at 3pm, but a friend of ours got early check in at 10am (so request for early check in if that's your thing). The exterior is gorgeous - it's the Fullerton after all. Inside it was really grand, with Chinese decor of red lanterns and banners.We stayed at a heritage room. The room is much bigger than we expected: there are stairs that lead to the room and a really high ceiling. It was luxurious - we thought we were in the wrong room. The view is obstructed by some barriers though. But we could still see the MBS from the room. Bathroom was amazing, large bathtub and shower, well lit vanity, marble. There's another kind of heritage room, with a balcony. The view was tall skyscrapers and the Fullerton Bay. So if you want some urban Parisian vibes, request for that room.The package which costs $410 (we used the SRP vouchers which discounted to $310 nett) had an afternoon tea. We liked the savouries but the sweets were too tangy and sweet. Hopefully they add more savouries in place of the sweets.My favourite part of the staycay was the pool. It's large enough and overlooks the downtown with these beautiful classical pillars. We swam at 7pm and 1pm (at 1.5hours intervals which is honestly more than enough). It's worth to swim twice, as at night we had the pool to ourselves but in the afternoon there were more people.The breakfast - I ordered a small portion of everything (yes, everything). My favourite was the pancakes, but my partner didn't like the bee hoon. Our friend loved the congee. It's a lot of food though, so... so I don't advice to order everything unless you're a big eater or there's at least three people. I love the alfresco dining (I love outdoor dining in general), right beside the river with a cool breeze. The service at Town Restaurant was impeccable: polite and enthusiastic.Overall, the stay was amazing and truly worth the $300, especially with the ultra large heritage room. Best of all, the 6pm check out is a really nice touch and honestly I wish more establishments had were this generous. One small gripe is that the water (Aqua Panna) costs $15 (that is just... extortionate). They give complimentary water but it's two small packets. To be honest, I'd prefer a super cheap brand but more bottles.",The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,4.5

We were also given a bottle of red wine as well as some desserts and in-room accessories to celebrate our anniversary. We absolutely loved the suite - the view, the facilities, the bar, and every single attention to details offered by the hotel staff.

Both our stays, 1 was on 6 Feb 2021 and the another was on 15 April 2021 with room number 1121. Both times we were checked in by Mr. Kelson. He was so friendly and helpful. During our first staycation he gave us a free upgrade of room and also gave a late check out. And during the next staycation we had to check in early as we planned to go Sentosa. We initially thought of just registering our names and heading off, but to our surprise he gave us a room. Excellent service rendered by Mr.Kelson who has arranged a seamless stay. Nice swimming pool and Gym with good view which is good for relaxing in the evening as well. Room was clean and cosy. There are hand sanitizer in the lift and the room have 2 masks for guests.

Above all, we adore the warm hospitality & personal pampering extended during our stays.While I was awaiting for my Club room, I had coffee served by Paul @ The Carvery. My key card was brought and I was pleasantly surprised to see Kelson(front desk manager) helping to prepare my room.  After a quick chat, I retreated into the chill of the room, with a clear unblocked view of the ‘Shibuya’ crossing of SG & the Southern Ridges. My fave lounge is by the infinity pool where the bar, Aqua Luna, is also situated. During Cocktail hour, Nancy brought our drinks as well as a fiery platter of bar bites. Dinner @ The Carvery was cozy and served delectable portions of wagyu burger. When we decided to bring the party of 4 out to Aqua Luna when the rain subsided, Nancy’s service was on point and attentive.During breakfast, which was a full house as it was a long weekend, we were served by the Hotel Manager, Rachel. Rachel provided the personal touch by bringing our food and checking in on our needs.

Then the disappointment came at dinner time when I have to wait for 45 minutes just to have some ice and cutlery sent to my room. And the items requested was incorrect too. This is not the kind of service I expect of Park Hotel. The sender (big guy from restaurant probably) sounded arrogant during delivery and expect things to be in order when it's not. Missing 2 tea spoon for my dessert.Overall, while I like the hotel snd service at front desk, the rest of the crew is quite a disappointment..

27,4.0,"This hotel is highly rated with some great facilities and services offered. However, thanks to COVID I assume, half these facilities and services are not offered. I was informed they were low on staff so couldn't offer the babysitting service. The Crystal Club Lounge is closed off, and you can't access Level 19 upwards. Technically you can only book each of facilities (pool/gym) only ONCE a day via your phone, but one staff member gave me the tip that you can book more than once if you use someone else's phone/device as well. The Coffee Belt stall on the ground floor is closed. When I checked in, they handed me an out-of-date booking/menu sheet with all the QR codes - one for the defunct Coffee Belt - with times for dining at The Carvery that turns out were inaccurate.The best thing about Park Hotel Alexandra has to be that it's situated literally RIGHT NEXT TO Ikea! We had quite a few fun trips there.The rooms were clean, the food was well priced at The Carvery, the 'Complimentary Cocktails' as part of the package were just a wine/beer/juice (no actual cocktails) though the free snacks were very nice, the infinity pool was lovely (a nice section for a toddler).

29,3.0,"1.Booking online Manage to get 1 for 1 deal after a long hassle as the customer service online had guide me wrongly for the purchase of the deal.It took awhile for me to sort the issue and to be honest, it was kind of disappointing due to the frustration I had to deal with as I was here for a recharging weekend.2. Check inI checked in on a Saturday afternoon, it was clear that they are under staff for the check in and  the poor receptionist was being shouted by some customer as the turnover for the room is not as fast as expected.I must say that the manager Hafiz has held up his service standard despite being understaff. The rough estimation for check in takes about 30mins at least if you are looking at checking in on a Saturday.3. Cocktail This is another incident of being understaff too, there were influx of customer at Luna and the poor girl was handling it alone. Let aside, we noticed that her system seems to be down so she had to manually record it and run to and fro to pass the order. Thus it delays a bit of time to provide a better service to the customer. 4. Breakfast The breakfast on the Sunday morning was really bad in a way as they were understaff again. We noticed the restaurant was full and some seated outside too. But there were only 4 staff running the whole place, including 1 who is handling the queue. Thus a lot of waiting to be waited. Food wise it was still not bad. But only limited to one set per pax. However situation on Monday morning is totally different, much lesser crowd and of course better service from the staff too. Totally love how the service from May when I requested extra items. She gladly helped me and we chatted a bit too. It was a much friendlier and enjoyable session. 5. RoomWe had the park suite, which was amazing. The best of the entire stay, I must say the house keeping also done a really good job in keeping the room very neat! You will be amaze by how big the place was! :)6. Location The location itself is awesome as it is walking distance to IKEA, alexandra food Village, ABC Brickworks and anchorpoint. No worries of not having any food! 7. Laundry services I am amazed by their cleaning services! I was entitled to 2 pieces of laundry, one of the top has some black stain that was really hard to remove and has been on it for months despite washing it regularly. But their laundry services manage to clean it and my top look as new as it was! Overall experience, will recommend the place for the room, and if possible, come on a weekday or Sunday! I am sure you will love it! ","Park Hotel Alexandra, Singapore",4.5
30,4.0,"First impressions first, upon arrival. You need to complete an online e-registration form. I was told by the concierge to take a seat while completing the form, and that I would be called back into the queue once I was done. However, I was not called. When I returned to the queue, I was allowed to join it after informing the concierge that I had completed the form. This was a source of conflict for other guests who trusted the concierge's words and watched the queue fill up with people, while they waited for their turn to be called. To hotel management: please educate your concierge on the importance of his wording. ""You may join the queue once you are doing with e-registration"" is very different from ""we will call you to the queue once you are done"". Check in was relatively quick and I was issued a piece of paper with QR codes to different dining menus, and also the QR code for booking facilities. There are four lifts here and they work pretty quickly. I booked a Crystal Club room. At 24 square metres, the room felt a little small. The bed was comfortable to sleep in though, and this would be one of the stronger points. There's two bottled water provided and also a pack of two masks and one bottle of sanitiser. My room 1730 had a good view of the swimming pool below, and also of The Interlace development. There is a bluetooth speaker by the bedside, which is greater for playing songs from your phone. One of the issues here is that there are no easy to reach HDMI ports near the table, unlike other hotels. If you are looking to connect your laptop to the television, you will need to physically locate the HDMI port on it, which was rather challenging. The television can only be adjusted to some degree due to the bracket it is attached to. I called for the technician who took about five minutes before we could connect the HDMI cable on. For Cystal Club guests, as the lounge is currently closed, evening cocktails from 6 to 8pm can be taken at Aqualuna on the seventh floor. There's probably a free flow of drinks like house pour wine, Asahi beer and juices. However, there was only one serving of food, which included paper wrapped chicken, gyozas and sweet potato fries. Requests for additional portions are chargeable. Facilities-wise, the swimming pool is great for swimming and relaxing. It receives plenty of sun after 11 in the morning. There is sufficient space for children to play in the pool, and also space for swimming. The gym on the other hand has two usable treadmills, one elliptical and one stationary bicycle for your cardio needs. There is also a rack of weights, with a normal bench and another decline bench for the free weights section. Breakfast here was had at The Carvery, and you need to book your slot to have breakfast. I had the Nasi Lemak option, and this was decent. The rice was fragrant, and the sambal was a little sweet. When the menu said fried chicken, I was not expecting four pieces of chicken bites (or karaage), but this was alright. Breakfast also comes with a plate of fruits, a croissant and pain au chocolat. The two pastries were nothing to shout about though. Overall, if I were to return again, I would probably book the standard room and enjoy the use of facilities. The advantage of this hotel is its proximity to Alexandra Village and ABC hawker centres, which will give you plenty of choices.","Park Hotel Alexandra, Singapore",4.5

Not hygienic at all.4) Same Front desk staff claims that only 1 carpark coupon could be claimed for a 3D2N stay despite clarifying for multiple times. eventually I approached the concierge staff and they issued 1 per day.5) club lounge is closed and this was not reflected on Klook website. the only arrangement for club privileges was evening cocktail. not worth the price paid for a club room.6) borrowed an umbrella (the big one) and it snapped backwards and hit my head while I was crossing the road. same front desk staff offered a replacement and did not even ask how I was when I returned the umbrella and informed him about it.7) breakfast is a set meal with coffee/tea and juices. need to make booking for breakfast slot.8) room is clean when I checked in. 9) on the evening of the 2nd day, I called operator (which led to Front desk) and requested for my bins to be emptied and toilet paper to be refilled. Front desk said this, 'Mdm we are very busy now. we won't be able to do this.' and proceeds to hang up after I said I don't mind if I had to wait a few hours since I was heading out. staff rushed up to pass me linings for the bin and 2 toilet rolls. eventually bins were not cleared even till my time when i checked out.to be frank, I wouldn't be coming back. though it was a good promotion 1-for-1 on klook, the service and amenities ain't worth my time.","Park Hotel Alexandra, Singapore",4.5
44,5.0,"Being school holidays, there was a queue for check-in. Rooms were not ready until around 6 pm, although the staff were really good at keeping us informed and we were offered complimentary drinks and a late check-out. (This appeared to be the norm for the three days we were there). Rooms were clean, modern but probably only comfortable for a maximum of two adults. The bed was comfortable and sleep comfort was excellent - didn't hear (much) noise from neighbours, and only occasional traffic noise from below. Reading LEDS on each side of the bed were available (yay), with a small desk. Unfortunately, no chaise longue available to stretch out to enjoy the view. All other mod cons provided (bathrobes, slippers, safe, ironing board), though I was a little surprised that club rooms had no differentiation factors like Nespresso coffee ( instant coffee sachets provided). In all respects, club rooms are identical to the standard rooms, bar the level (club = L17-L19).  Sadly, the club lounge at L19 is closed (in all fairness, this was pointed out at the time of reservation, but I didn't notice). Club benefits were served at L7 (Carvery) offering one hour of drinks and snacks, between 6 pm and 8 pm. Which meant that carvery staff had to manage both dine-in customers and those on club benefits, and life was tough for them. Breakfast was OK, rather than superb - the Asian choices ranged from OK to not very good, and the western choices were generally better. The standout points for Park Hotel Alexandra (1) Staff were friendly and helpful, despite it being obvious that they were short-staffed and working very hard. Have to flag out Paige and Nancy at the Carvery for their warmth and friendliness, despite working under pressure, and the front desk staff, for working hard to manage the check-in queues. (2) Location was good with lots of hawker eateries around, but no high end boutiques, if that is what you want. You have wonderful access to walks from here - the Southern Ridges, and the Greenway. (3) The view from the room (south-facing) was exceptional, with a view towards the Southern Ridges (4) the large and spacious infinity pool area (5) the toiletries provided (Appelles), which smelt wonderful.Overall, enjoyed the stay, but I think your mileage also depends on the price you paid. I do think that the PHG should also think about small in-room touches to differentiate club rooms from standard rooms. And a final shout out again to the staff, thank you for your hard work.","Park Hotel Alexandra, Singapore",4.5
45,3.0,"  This was my first visit to this hotel while my friends are repeat guests. They shared with us their previous pleasant experience staying in he crystal club room.   We checked into rooms 1701 and 1704 and stayed from 16-18 March 2021. It was the school holiday week and the lobby was filled with guests waiting for their rooms when we arrived at about 2pm. We finally managed to get one room at 6pm and the other at 7pm. The rooms are well-kept and clean. Everything was in working order.  We had booked the club superior rooms and were shocked to be told that the club lounge is closed and our evening cocktail relocated to The Carvery restaurant. There is a time limit of 1h for cocktail. We would not be able to “hang out” at the lounge or any other venue for drinks outside the cocktail hour. I would advise against booking the club rooms till it is confirmed that the lounge is open.   We expressed our concerns to Kelson, the front desk manager. He was apologetic and offered us dining credits. We rejected his offer of late checkout. We observed that on the next afternoon, the lobby was filled with guests waiting for rooms again. I guess the same situation repeated itself.   On a more positive note, we could observe the synergy in the staff members as we saw Kelson and some of his colleagues chipping in and helping the housekeepers to prepare rooms for waiting guests. However, I do not really think this is a good long term solution to the problem.  The hotel was shorthanded in many departments and despite this, the few staff at The Carvery were really hardworking, friendly and efficient. We were impressed with their service during our breakfasts, cocktails and dinner.  I would have given the hotel a 1 star review (something which I have hardly done in my many reviews here) if not for Kelson and his team of hardworking colleagues. We have left some suggestions verbally to Kelson and a few managers we met. We did not get to meet Miss Rachel Ng, the acting hotel manager. Perhaps she could work with them to improve the experience for future guests.","Park Hotel Alexandra, Singapore",4.5

She maintained professionalism but her tone and speech was not too formal;  it did not feel like it was fake or something that was scripted. I felt her genuine warmth welcome and willingness to assist me. I remembered that I apologised and said that I understood I was early for check in but she said, and I quote, “No problem, Maam. I appreciate you coming early for check in.” I was surprised by her response. She complimented me  without me complimenting her first or expecting a compliment from a guest. At first I was puzzled by her response, but later on, I learned that there was a very long queue of people waiting to check in. So, I did not have to wait long. She explained the standard procedures thoroughly and clearly. The check in process was seamless. And shortly after I reached my room, she called my room and ask if there were any problems with the room. Her efforts to give a good service should be recognised. Her name was Mae.

2,5.0,"Since my husband and I have our anniversary in April, we decided to avail ourselves of the government’s offer and book a staycation at a subsidy.  We chose Parkroyal because of its distinctive architecture and good location.  I booked a club room because we enjoy things like all-day beverages and snacks.  We enjoyed our stay of 2D1N very much and here are some small touches that really made a difference: 1. High tea starts at 2pm but our check in time was supposed to be from 3pm.  I emailed the hotel and I got a response from Serene saying no worries, we could just come up to the lounge and get started with tea at 2pm.  We checked in seamlessly upon our arrival at 2 and were scoffing down scones in no time! 2. Evening cocktails was very fun, and the bartenders were obliging with my diet requirements of no added sugar.  3. The good service continued into the next day and we were well looked after by Jia Ying during breakfast.  We really have nothing but good memories of our lounge experience and can suggest that once you meet Serene, that’s your stay sorted! Since this is a review after all, some negatives: a. Housekeeping can be improved, it’s not great having to make multiple requests before something is responded to. b. The gym equipment needs some sprucing up, whether old or dirty, even if the equipment is not being used due to COVID safe distancing measures, at least make sure it looks clean, otherwise the impression it gives is that the hotel is not bothered.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

6,4.0,"Stumbled upon this package, Suite Dreams Come True when browsing for next staycation. Wasn’t aware there’s such package from my last stay, I must say overall value wise it’s definitely a steal. This is my second stay with PARKROYAL Pickering, the first was the same Junior Suite (under Collection which the difference was only the toiletries - non-Collection has the standard where Collection equip with Elemis). Suite wise nothing to shoutout, I still think this is one of the nicer, and affordable suite stay in Singapore. This time I request for a different view, and so they place me next to their Urban settings which was pretty. The whole package includes “black car” return transfer (which was excellent), 2hrs of massage at St Gregory SPA (standard, I’d say one of the smaller SPA I’ve been to), Collection Benefits (afternoon tea, evening cocktails and champagne breakfast. So glad the menu was change and it was yummier this time. Love the duck salad), dinner buffet for two at LIME (which was terrible. - sorry PARKROYAL, the buffet is one of the worst ones I had in my life. The seafood isn’t fresh, selection isn’t good although it was Easter weekend. It tasted “cheap” honestly, part of the 4/5 this time). Also included bottle of champagne and some strawberries in room. All in all like I said, it’s a very good deal for a normal consumer. We just find the buffet at LIME really bad, and lesson learnt not to book on a long weekend. Even Platinum members won’t get late check-out like the usual DISCOVERY hotels. Perhaps my take in improvements, staff all around could be friendlier (the only person I must say the friendliest of all, the Chinese doorman at the concierge). I am comparing this to their sister hotel, Pan Pacific which has more color on every delivered hospitality. Didn’t receive a carepack this time. The sound bar in room isn’t working. Perhaps round of check before guest check in? Amazing change of menu at the lounge, keep that up. Pools can be really crowded, perhaps limit to even lesser crowd? You can do better PARKROYAL Pickering :)","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

8,1.0,"We check-out of the hotel on 4th April 2021 and had a horrible staycation.No staff was at the driveway to welcome or assist us with our luggage. My wife had to carry our baby and struggle with the baby pram in the taxi boot while i was paying the taxi fare.I was only given a room at 6pm when the check-in time stated 3pm. The counter staff explained that the housekeeping could not cope and the room was still being clean.When I check-out on 4/4/21 at about 1200 noon, there was no one to assist us with our luggage or taxi calling. My family with a baby in tow had to call a taxi on our own at the driveway. While waiting for the taxi to arrive at the taxi stand, a blond European guy was swinging his golf club wildly in front of us. When i told him that my family is behind him, he just gave me a hard stare and continued  his wild swinging of his golf club. I tried looking for the security but none was seen at the driveway.  There were many other people around at that time. The security must advise the European guy to stop swinging his golf club at the hotel taxi stand. What if he hit someone or lost his grip on the golf club.Terrible service and safety.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

All will be delivered at your table. Upon entry at the Lime restaurant, welcome greet is expected,and you will be brought to your desired seat. Facilities are far unique among other places. The pool is defined with a unique architecture of bird cage like design. The pool is good to depict am infinity connection to the city horizon. There is a jacuzzi beside the lap pool. There is a patio on the right-side upon exiting the 5th floor lift lobby while the pool is on the left. The hotel in my own word is the hybrid concept of modern and environmental ecology so you won’t feel the bustle of life in the city.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

Both activities did not take place despite confirmation via email prior to the dates, as well as during check in. We were told that the mixologist did not turn up when we reported for the activity at the lime bar at 3pm and were offered a glass of wine as an apology. The garden tour was worse - we received a confirmation call at about 10+am confirming the tour scheduled for 11.30am and to meet at level 5. We reached before 11.30am and waited till 11.45am. There was no staff deployed to conduct the tour. There was an ROM ceremony and when my husband tried to enter the garden next to where the ROM ceremony was held to check if there was any staff conduct the tour, he was abruptly stopped by a not so polite staff who told him to wait till the ceremony was over. What kind of customer service is this? I hope the hotel management will look into this and not provide empty promises that could not be fulfilled.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

The fantastic location of the hotel. However, I had a very strange experience with the One Connect service person on duty on 27Mar (Sat) around 4pm. I called to inform that I do not need housekeeping for my 3 day stay. I was told, please call back tomorrow as she has no way to notify. I was like ‘fine, then can I have r extra towels’? The operator asked ‘how many?’. I said 3. She said ‘how many people is staying in the room?’. Me ‘2’. She replied ‘hmm... you need that many??’. Me ‘well, it’s for 3 days and I do not want housekeeping and there’s only 2 towels in the room now’. I didn’t see a need to explain that my wife and I run every morning so we take more showers then the usual hotel guest. Because why do I need to? Should she just respond with ‘sure, I will arrange that and is there anything I can help you with?’ I don’t believe this is due to lack of training . It’s an attitude problem. This operator must be too lazy to do her job , or she is probably serving her last day of resignation notice. Still, one bad employee didn’t spoil the good work of the others. This is still a very good stay part from this truly unique experience I had with this One Connect operator .","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

However, not much explanation on the facilities, the how-to, bookings available, etc. Luckily, having stayed at other hotel, we managed to figure things out. Upon entering the room, to our horror, guess what we found in the mini fridge? A ‘naked’ instant noodle with sauce packets and disposable fork. There was also a yellowish ‘spill’. We called ‘0’ and the person on the line told us to throw it away ourselves and that sometimes, the mini fridge is ‘auto-locked’. Whatever that meant. Nevertheless, this made me doubt if all the rooms is thoroughly cleaned and whether standards are compromised due to ‘fully booked’ status. Moreover, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. This has been a very, very disappointing 3 nights stay in a 5-star hotel. On the other hand, dinner at Lime restaurant was good. Room size was good. Toiletries were sufficient. Gym was nice. Swimming pool was quite crowded. At checking out, staff Chin at the reception was very friendly and even greeted us when we went for breakfast earlier in the morning.

I tried approaching a lady on the furthest right counter (she’s sitting down and the counter says “discovery”) and she was extremely rude when i tried to explain my issue to her nicely. (I think she may be the senior in charge there as she was wearing a black formal jacket while everybody else were wearing a grey jacket) she stared us down and snapped at us unrelentingly. I gave up and decided to approach Ms Chin at another counter and reiterated my issues to her (in the exact manner as how i told the lady in the black jacket). Ms Chin’s attitude was completely different. She listened to us intently, showed empathy and concern. Even when there was a long line of people waiting to check in, she remained calm and attended to our enquires. She did an amazing job by juggling between two counters without compromising on service quality. Ms Chin’s service recovery attempt was definitely applaudable. Please give her recognition and if possible an award for her outstanding service! As an employee in a service related industry too, I was extremely inspired by her pleasant service and will be sharing my experience with my colleagues so that all of us can learn from her too.

We didn’t even scold her and we are just asking. 3) Staff Nigel at Lime restaurant was rude- while speaking to him, he keep looking at the computer and typing his stuff instead of focusing on our need- My husband and I asked about having dinner while waiting for our room but we were being rejected as restaurant was full - We offered to wait but they say will not have a seat as there’s late night reservation too4) Breakfast not confirmed even with advance booking - My husband and I wanted to book for next day breakfast - Nigel told us we can reserve but we will not have priority as restaurant only can hold 130pax and people who came before us might bring in more children or elderlies which make reservations tough to confirm- our qns is: i) why are hotel stayers not given priority? ii) why does a reservation not gaurantee us a seat? iii) why should you all serve so many others who doesn’t embrace integrity? (Whereby if they know 10 will be coming for eg, they book only for 4 & doesn’t give restaurant a real number to plan the seats allocation properly?)5) Not Honest about your Facebook Reviews!!- Initially we can read a lot of your past good and bad reviews but now my friends and I no longer can access to any reviews already, yet your score showed 5 out of 5 and that’s visible to all .. dishonesty is not honourable at all.

And we are simply brush off by the reason that this arise due to school holiday.2) Issues with the condition of the bathroom’s drainage system.Was in extreme shock to see the water has overflow till the entrance area because the drainage is not in working condition. To make things worst, we explained this situation (this happened around 11 PM plus) to the front desk and requested for staff to clean up the area.

Was hoping there’s room service during the time when we went for breakdown but nil. It’s okay - so we made a call to the front desk to request for room service and mentioned just to clean up the wet area will do. Almost 1 hour later, noticed there’s still no staff come up to our room - made 2nd call again and mentioned that we had actually requested for the room service an hour ago. To my shock, the staff replied “Madam, I understand you will check out the room later?”. Yes, we will check out later in the noon but my request for room service (Just to clean up the wet floor) is a valid request??

51,1.0,"It was supposed to be a birthday staycation treat for my girlfriend and it turned out to be our worst hotel experience ever. We checked in before 2pm and were told that our room will only be available at 5pm and we will get a call.We came back to the hotel close to 5pm to a chaotic mess at the lobby and queued to speak to concierge service again. The lobby was jam packed with guests with no seats around. Queued until 6pm and I was not even close to the concierge. Thereafter, I managed to get hold of this staff standing around by the name of Norman. He checked and told us that our room is not ready, he paid me lip service that he will expedite it to be ready in 30min and we will get a call from him. We went to the garden and waited until 7.30pm. I went down and could not locate him and queued for the concierge service. Still in the queue, I managed to get Norman but this time he said that it needed at least another hour. He told us to wait at the garden and paid me another lip service that he tried to put us in another room but to no avail then walked away.At this point, our plans for the evening have been completely ruined. We were not going to wait another hour and contemplated canceling the booking to go home. Finally about 8pm, I actually managed to speak to a concierge staff. After checking, apparently our room bathroom door was faulty. The concierge service staff apologised for our long wait and offered us to have a drink at the collection lounge.Why were we not offered to wait at the lounge earlier, instead we were left to sweat and endure the heat at the garden. Why were we not told that our room has a faulty bathroom door and it would take a long time to fix. We checked in before 2pm, told to wait until 5pm and eventually got our room close to 9pm. By the time we settled down, most of the restaurants nearby were closing. To sum up my girlfriend's birthday staycation, we had McDonald's for a late dinner celebration.We waited for a full 7 hours, a simple call to update us that the room preparation situation was worse would have been helpful. We could at least make new plans instead of being left hanging in the air with your staff avoiding discussing it because he did not want to deal with the issues involved. Lastly, I would like to thank the lady concierge service staff for giving us the lounge access to have tea, that was our saving grace. By then we were so drained and I forgot to get her name. Nonetheless, Thank you.  ","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

The room was spacious, clean and good amenities provided. The front office executive by the name of Ms Chin was extremely polite, friendly and patient despite our requests and enquiries. Uncle Ang from the housekeeping department was another staff who deserves to be commended. We definitely recommend this hotel and hope to be back again!","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
53,2.0,"Expect to wait for hours without room, and get turn away at the pool with no replacement slot. If you are booking the collection rooms then luckily you, least u can chill at the lounge. Otherwise, go home and wait.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
54,1.0,"We are a family of 2 adults and 3 young children and we took two rooms 915 and 916 from 14-15 March 2021. It was the birthday month for my daughter and myself. One room was complimentary as part of the Healthcare HERO program while we paid for an additional room.My advise to families with young children1. Avoid these rooms as they located along a narrow corridor with short metal poles along it (see photo). This can be dangerous for children who may try to climb over the poles.2. The condition of room 915 was poor (see photo on bathtub and washbasin). The washbasin has multiple brownish stains and looks disgusting. This was highlighted for the duty manager who eventually came back to confirm that it’s a permanent stain. That’s it - no offer to change room or what so ever - just accept it. Wonder why people would pay money to stay in rooms in this condition?3. Swimming pool - supposedly a highlight of our trip for the kids - was fully booked from the time of our check in till the time of check out.4. Restaurant - only 1 available - Lime Restaurant was fully booked for dinner. Was not offered to be on waitlist. Advised to turn up at restaurant to try our luck. We waited 2 hours, turned up at restaurant and was turned away. To add salt to wound - told that others were waitlisted instead. Btw, I am a discovery Black member (supposing my the top tier). Makes you wonder why would you want to be an elite member with pan pacific?? I am a lowly gold member (mid tier) with Hilton and was treated with much respect and impeccably service compared to pan pacific.Begs the question why anyone would pay or invest their time for a staycation to be treated this way? One would expect the hotel to showcase its best in times like this. Maybe the GM of Parkroyal Pickering would bother to explain?","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
55,5.0,Service crew were patient and responded promptly to requests and queries. Helped arrange for late check-out and bathtub based on availability. Room was fitted with a relaxing bathtub and modern design. Views from room and pool were magnificent.,"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
56,5.0,"This staycation was absolutely fantastic. Due to my GHA Black status, I was instantly given early check in and late check out. With the 6pm late check out, it provided extra time to fully enjoy the facilities. I was able to take my time in the gym and stroll around the area without the rush of checking out. The “green” theme is very prominent in this hotel and shows in the multiple plants decorating many areas of the hotel. When you walk into the hotel, you see plants. The entire gym and pool floor is adorned with plants and you can even take a “nature walk” around the floor admiring all the different plants. To access our room, we walked through an open air corridor also adorned with plants. This hotel would please any nature lover. The green theme is also shown in the room with glass bottles instead of plastic bottles. Some hotels take the green theme too far and turn it into a cost cutting exercise but not this one. I counted at least 6 glass bottles of water in the room. Toiletries are still provided in plastic bottles but I think it is more for hygiene reasons than anything else. The highlight of the stay was the Club Lounge. The place was Brilliant! Friendly and accommodating staff. There was one tiny hiccup though. It seems that the lounge is closed for breakfast on weekdays. No one mentioned this on check in so I went up to an empty and locked lounge. When I went back down to Lime Restaurant, I was instantly ushered to my table without much of a wait. Despite having breakfast in the main restaurant, the staff made an effort to recognise Club guests and still provided champagne despite not being in the club lounge. They do this by seating Club guests separately from non-club guests. So if you are a club guest staying on a weekday be sure to double check you are seated at the right area!Apart from breakfast, Club guests enjoy afternoon tea and evening cocktails. I loved that the afternoon tea sets came in proper three tiered stands. The food was properly presented and of high quality. The evening cocktails was my favourite though. The food served was alright, but the highlight was the cocktails. They probably served one of the most extensive cocktails menu I have seen on my staycations so far. They even served Aperol Spritz, which is quite rarely served in local hotel club lounges.All in all, a fine staycation with great food and drinks, personable and professional staff, and a unique garden hotel within a garden city. This is now one of my favourite hotels for staycation! Can’t wait to be back!","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
57,5.0,"Had a great stay in Park Royal on Pickering once more. This time, once again because of the staff.Upon arriving at the hotel, to our horror. The queue was really long! It was all the way to the guest lift of the hotel. Even as club room guest or even with our membership level, we have to queue all the way to the back. there wasn’t a single dedicated check in for hotel higher status membership guests. This is definitely something that other hotels are doing better. I really hope the hotel management can do something about this. Even direct check in at club lounge will be good. There are reasons why guests pay extra or even achieved the higher membership status. Luckily, we met with great and friendly, Serene who remembered us and know of our membership status and current booking. She led us to club lounge for check in. It was truly a relief! Save us waiting for at least 45 mins of wait! Serene settled the check in for us smoothly without any hiccups. We were served by the lounge staff while she was settling our check in. It was a great flow, very smooth and impeccable. Serene came back with our keys and told us she has gotten the room all ready for us as she has seen our bookings earlier on. Everything was settled. We were impressed by her memory and how good she is. I have to say. She is really one of the best, if not the best staff we have seen in this hotel. I stand by my words for this. If any of you have met Serene before, you will know she is just so easy going and friendly! She does her work perfectly well! There wasn’t any upgrade for that day due to high occupancy. So we are in our junior suite. It was facing the hong lim park, and everything was clean and good. Went to the pool and it was a tad bit crowded with people (but still adhering to social distancing rules and number of people). We left quickly after too crowded for our liking (our personal preferences).Evening cocktail time was good. Even though Serene was on morning shift so we didn’t see her. Jenisah was alone there with the chef. Both of them handled the whole evening cocktail well. For the breakfast at lime, there is an area for club lounge guests which are quieter and better. The whole restaurant were filled with people. Once again, we saw Serene there in the restaurant it was great to see her again! It was surprising to see her there though. Thought she was in charge of club lounge only. It must be tiring for her.I have to say one thing, the eggs for the breakfast were quite well done! The omelette was really well cooked and taste just nice! Egg dish even though it is a simple dish but it is not easy to do well. The simplest stuff is the hardest to achieve. I somehow managed to get the chef name from Serene. Chef Candy. Thank you for the omelette that was really well done! Even when we ordered 2, the consistency was the same. It takes quite a bit of skill and experience to be able to do that. Once again, I would like to thank these staff that made our stay once again memorable. Especially Serene. We look forward to seeing you again in the future stay.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
58,3.0,"Check-in: Ok without long queue. Lobby was inviting. Front desk explained the benefits of the club booking but the staff missed out the tour bus ticket and welcome drink.Room: Decent size, not huge but ok. Bathroom though small, is well-designed. Supposedly eco-friendly. Sanitizer care pack provided, a nice touch.Club Lounge: Views and décor are amazing, that's about it. Food during high-tea and evening canapés are disappointing. All served together and cold. Cocktail was good though took pretty long to serve.Breakfast: Nothing much to shout about, at least the eggs and beehoon were served warm. Plus point was the champagne. Property: The key selling point, very green and nicely maintained. Pool with great view. We had nice walks around the gardens and found a hidden waterfall. Maintenance might be costly and we wonder is it due to this that other aspects of the hotel stay are compromised. Overall the package looks great on paper but expectations were not met. There are other properties with the same price point that offers better value.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
59,3.0,"Check-in - Was expecting some sort of a welcome email sent prior to the stay for booking of facilities like what other hotels are doing, but I did not receive any of such.. i called the hotel at 12nn the day before my stay to request for early check-in but was told to call back after 9pm to check again as they cannot decide so early. Was eventually told I could check-in at 1pm. In my call I also asked about booking of facilities and the staff took down my swimming pool timeslot booking request. However, upon checking in at front desk, we were told that our pool booking was not keyed in at all. Hmm. Room - We chose the Lifestyle King room with tub. Had to make a special request for the room with tub because not all rooms come with a tub. The room was spacious and beautiful with ample storage space for your stuff. The plug for our tub was faulty though and could not be released. Tried calling the hotline for help and as with my previous call to the hotel, it took ages just to try to get my call picked up. Eventually I gave up and just went down to front desk to ask for help. An engineer was sent to my room rather swiftly thereafter. Swimming pool - was told timeslots available are 3pm, 430pm or 6pm. We took the 6pm slot. It gets very chilly in the evening. Beautiful view.Breakfast - probably the most disappointing part of our stay. Not sure if selection was reduced due to Covid but that's fine. Worst point was that some of the food was served cold or at best lukewarm. Imagine having cold congee or noodles served to you for breakfast when you are expecting a hot meal.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
60,2.0,"Recently booked 2 rooms from the collection series (Allows lounge visit)Lounge review - Extremely poor selection of food and poor quality - It is no wonder there were very few guests in the lounge. Food were of poor quality and does not justify the additional money for lounge access.Champagne breakfast - It is now at the main Lime restaurant. There does not seem to be any separation or identification of any sort between collection guests vs other guests which makes it difficult for collection guests to be served champagne  promptly. Appreciate if the hotel can consider having a separate section for collection member.Check In - Appears that there is no separate check in line for Discovery Platinum/Black members and collection guests unlike the other hotels. Front desk staff - Very poor knowledge of hotel's operation - Gave inaccurate information on business office opening status and unable to provide business office Wifi password on request (unable to provide it after 30minutes wait)Check Out - Poor customer service yet again by staff when bill has billing error. Frontdesk staff brushed it off immediately by saying oh another staff provided the wrong information and hence the charges are as stated.This is my first stay with my family in this hotel and it will be the last. While the hotel itself is famed for all its greenaries, it appears that the staff are extremely lacking in terms of knowledge and lack of responsibility when other staff made mistakes? It is easy to understand why the other hotel groups are doing better in retaining loyalty to brands.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

It took forever to check in, we had to que like a boarding school for breakfast- and offered the most sub-standard breakfast I  have seen at a hotel- again referencing boarding school! The staff were rude and no one (not even the manager) bothered to greet us when we left breakfast- which we didn't even eat! The room was not super clean and the pool needs maintenance- part of the wood structure fell off whilst we were in the pool! I appreciate the covid shifts- but all the staycations I have had have really embraced this and made me want to return not the opposite!

72,4.0,"Stayed three nights here for a staycation. Hotel room is very nice and clean. The free bottles of water has a cap that isn’t easy to open and broke easily. Pool is quite nice, even if there’s never actual sun directly on the pool longer than a few minutes. If you’re interested in a sunny pool, this isn’t one of them. The restaurant food is just okay, the pool side food and drink service takes a long time to arrive, and food quality could be better. I had nasi goreng special, and it was mediocre compared to the hotels of the same standards like Hyatt or Hilton. Upon check in, a hotel pamphlet was given with room key about the exclusive deals you get when you are a hotel guest. In the leaflet it says 20% off spa, 30% off in house dining and in-room dining, and other discounts. I had to ask for these discounts to be applied as it was not immediately reflecting on the bill. For the in-room dining or in-house dining, I also had to check with reception about this, and they insist at first that there are no such discount. The room-service server when ask about this, said there’s a $30 dining voucher that can be redeem, not a 30% off the bill as written in the pamphlet. I had to ask twice about the said discounts upon check-out before it was finally given. Everyone was nice, nobody had an attitude, I had no problem not getting any discount if it was not reflected on the pamphlet. I was just surprise that Pan Pacific would put out a promise like that and quietly was not going to honour it if the guest does not ask. Don’t give a discount if you don’t want to, just don’t print it on your pamphlet so in case someone staying here ACTUALLY read them they would realise they’ve not been given what was promised in the collaterals.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

Hence we took the trouble to head down to reception again.5.15pm we were attended by Junjun who than check on our room and said that our room is ready they will do a room check and bring the key card to our holding room and bring us to the new room.6pm there’s still no sign of anyone nor calls. Called operator again and operator said that our room will only be ready by 7pm. I understand that things haven been easy for hoteliers however I believe I have been very kind and patient waiting for an update which is not follow up promptly by anyone with many compromise above. I was supposed to have a birthday party setup but everything just got delayed. Finally operator called back again and said room is now ready at 6.30pm and we finally got our room.Order for $300+ worth of room service and requested for ice bucket and was told that only 1st time is complimentary any additional would be chargeable at $5. Requested for a wine opener and again was told that it’s chargeable at $5.Can’t believe a prestige 5 star hotel is charging every single basic item when I would expect it to be available in room instead of me calling to request.DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO STAY HERE TO SPOILT YOUR SPECIAL DAY.,"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5
98,5.0,"We are very thankful that we were greeted by excellent service staff in our stay at ParkRoyal. From the time we checked in, we met Ibrahim at the counter. When my kids were asking qns about the hotel, he never once ignored them. In fact he was so patient and took time to answer them and even affirm their ideas. Then when we had our meals at their lounge area, it was definitely an experience not to be missed. Good view, Good meal and Good staff! We met Chef Edmond and he took time to chat with my kids and even remembered their conversation. Next day he even surprised my son with pancakes & strawberries where my son casually mentioned it was something he liked. We were so touched by his gesture, he was not there to just do his job he went the extra mile to show his care to us. And though he was working there the whole day, he wld still greet us with a smile. :) Not only the chef was friendly and welcoming, even the service staff too. Serene and Desmond were a few that we met and got their names. They also took time to check in on us and see how we were doing.. One thing we notice that is consistent with the staff is that no matter how tired or busy they are, they will still do their best to serve you well.. They will always smile and speak very politely to you too.Overall, it has been a very pleasant experience for sure and would definitely come back again if we have the chance.. Kudos to the wonderful service staff that is working hard behind the scenes to make our stay a pleasant & enjoyable one! Thank you.","PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel",4.5

7,3.0,"If you are looking for a relaxing staycation with customer service, look elsewhere.The hotel facility is rather new but not well maintained, the hotel did fix them after I inform them of the issue as I felt it was hazardous. Beddings were comfortable, but we did not sleep well because the pillows were extremely uncomfortable. It was an odd shape, extremely high and hard.F&B was average, 1 of the F&B staff was particularly chatty and I found the whole dinning experience a little noisy. I'm a coffee addict but this is the first time I hate the coffee so much I had only 1 sip of it. This is a first for my experience with hotel's coffee. The pool is rather small, sufficient for 4-5 groups of guest as most guest brought children along. However, no one was there to monitor the number of guest in the pool area. Even if you have no booking, you could enter the pool area using the room key card. I also don't see anyone cleaning the pool area after each 2 hour block, even if you stay at the pool pass your booking time, no one came to remind you that time was up. The booking system for breakfast/afternoon tea/cocktail/pool/gym was simple, scan the QR code in the room and book via the chat. Lights and aircon can be adjusted with the one and only control panel at the deep end of the room. If you are not IT savvy, you are in trouble. Took me a good 15 minutes to explore the panel.Great location by the way, minutes away to MRT station, malls, Fort Canning Park. Overall, I would say this hotel is ok if you are looking for good value and fuss free stay. But I won't pay to stay in this hotel if not for the promotion.","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Bread was hard as rock, milk and coffee were diluted (wow), cereal tasted really weird, orange juice was diluted too (wow).

After looking through the hotel choice, we decided not to choose a hotel in town but also somewhere nearby where is convenience to travel to different places. Throughout our 3 days 2 nights stay, We bring our little one to MBS, Suntec and Orchard where we believe that the little had fun but we are both tired. Transport to all of these places is convenience via public transport. The experience was good, the hotel look nice and new. Friendly staffs welcome us and make our registration fast and easy.

20,4.0,"The check in procedure was fast and was pleasantly surprised when we were offered a complimentary upgrade without having to ask! Did not manage to get the name, but we were served by a Pinoy gentlemen with black specs. When we entered the room, he called again twice to brief us about the control panel, and asked if we need any further assistance. His service ought to be recognised. The room was decent, minimalistic and clean. Had some trouble with the aircon but managed to get someone up a few calls later.However, no one briefed us that the executive club lounge was closed and the alternative options for our benefits. In fact, the club access was blocked off by curtains but it was confusing as there was a signage that stated the opening hours.We also headed down to ask for extra cutlery around 8pm. To our dismay, the entire lobby was dark and nobody was present. Thus we decided to try again later. We showed up again near 3am and thankfully there was 1 staff present. As we were heading back to our room, we were shocked to find that the pathway to our corridors were pitch black.. completely eerie.Breakfast was average too, but they did compensate us for miscommunication of order by giving us extra pastries.The hotel also felt extremely understaffed. However, I genuinely enjoyed my stay and would recommend. The pool was absolutely beautiful, empty and relaxing. The sunbeds that float above the water were the best... I would return just to swim here again!","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

28,5.0,"Booked 2 x Crystal Club Deluxe Package (with Club Benefits) for a staycation with my parents and a friend. It was awesome!Check-in/outEasy reservation of dates through email. Pre-booked a check-in timing but unfortunately had to wait an hour before the rooms were ready. It's a good thing they had a comfy waiting area. Got a later check-out time by an hour so it was all good! The front desk staff (Ms. Melody) was extremely helpful and took the time to explain what were the club benefits/room amenities/booking of hotel facilities etc. Thank you! Check-out was smooth and quick. RoomsClean and spacious. Took a little bit of time to get the hang of all the controls (there's an app you can download to control everything on your phone but it requires you to sign up for an account so pass! Did everything on the control panel on the wall) but am impressed with all the functions. There's a QR code in the room that can used to book pool/gym facilities and breakfast/tea/cocktail timings. Club BenefitsReceived a letter with all the information of Club Benefits which, at this period of time, simply consists of afternoon tea or cocktail. [Why force us to make a choice? Couldn't it be 'and' instead of 'or'? It's a good thing we were staying for 2 nights so we managed to try both.] Food was good but nothing outstanding and... portions could be a little bit more? Friendly and prompt service from the restaurant staff. BreakfastNo hotel stay is complete without this meal for me. And GPCH did not disappoint.

36,1.0,"Strongly do not recommend this hotel. Out of all the hotels we’ve been to, this is the worst one of all. Prior to our stay, we’ve kept our expectation low after reading all the reviews. Amazingly the actual experience couldn’t even meet our low expectation. The room is nice, love the bed and bath tub, but the customer service is close to non-existent.We have tried calling the front desk a few times to request for water, soap, bath towel etc. It took us more than 10mins each time or even longer, that we have to go down all the way to the recep. Worst is even after requesting, they only get it sent to us after 2 hours... is just merely water bottle, soap etc that we’re requesting. When questioned on why it took so long, it was merely brushed off and said that there was a delay. Even their own staff was unable to explain what the delay is caused by, which is extremely laughable because it simply shows how efficient they are and how much they value their customers.We got the room with the club access, however due to the closing of the club lounge, we only get to enjoy the cocktail at level 3. Speechless with the services there. First day when we reach to enjoy the cocktail set, the couples seated beside us got served food and nobody serve anything to us even though we were there 15mins before the other couple, until we went to ask for it. We were then served the same time as another couple who were there 30mins after us. Other couples were also served additional cakes which we didn’t get it. Is it because we only book club premier and not suite? Why the vast difference in treatment may I know? 2nd day we were there, the other couple got serve before us as well even though we were there before them and it’s the same guy that served us. The breakfast is good though, also the servers when we have our breakfast were so much friendlier than the one that served us for cocktail. Guess this is the only part of our 3d2n stay that we experienced good customer service.The customer services have ruined our stay here. Definitely the first and last time here.","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

40,2.0,"Reception did not tell me much during check-in, until I asked for more information like breakfast locations, where do we go etc. I booked a club room, but the club lounge was closed, and club benefits minimal. The only difference between this and a normal room was that you could get an afternoon/evening set which included drinks and some food for an hour. Always seemed shorthanded, so service and food quality can be improved. In summary, expected more, but got a lot less. Dissapointing.","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

When we asked the front desk staff to help us with asking the housekeeping staff to replenish our coffee and tea in the room, no staff came up to replenish even after 1hr30mins. We had to ask the housekeeping staff outside our room to get the replenishment while she was cleaning up other rooms. The staff just did the bare minimum to attend to your request and then seem like they did not want anything to do with you. Wouldn’t want to come back again.

When we arrived at the reception on the first floor, the staff at the reception claims that they do not have our booking records and brought us to the second reception on the other floor. When we arrived at the second reception, the staff took 30 minutes to check us in. After we were handed the key, we proceeded to the room designated to us - room 416. To our horror, there was a couple still lying on the bed, seemingly naked. My partner was so taken aback by what we saw so we rushed out to the reception. We questioned the staff why this had happened and they were not able to provide us with a proper explanation so we decided that to cancel the stay with Grand Park City Hall for the lack of explanation and accountability. We also decided to cancel the stay.I am utterly disappointed with the way this was handled. It was horrendous. I really can't say this is a 5-star hotel.

To my surprise, there was no one answering the phone for a good long time. I tried and tried again, just no one is there. I even tried calling the concierge and the housekeeping - and yes nobody answers the call. For a good 30 minutes, we just settle into the room while leaving the speaker on, I gave up. No answers again. This is the first time that I felt so uneasy knowing that there will be no one to help us if there's any issues staying here. I had to go all the way to the lobby and speak to the front desk. I told him my problem, and told him that I've been calling for so long but there is no answer. He just apologised and I left. The next morning, we went for our breakfast at TableScape. When I arrive, I stand beside the bar counter for 5 minutes, in front of 3 staffs who was just speaking among themselves and stressing out. Knowing that they will not attend to me ever if I didn't make the first move, I step forward and tell them that I've booked a 10am slot with them. They just told me to give them a minute. Then after, a tall guy usher us to our table. The whole atmosphere was just stressful because all the staffs were stressed out and impatient. The way they attend to you, I could see they were too stressed out and unhappy.

Email from hotel telling us that check in can be done prior with option to select room using their app. But this failed and chat from app told us that during this peak period this service for app check is not available. (Isn’t using the app actually a good method to help manage your physical crowd?)Swimming pool/gym has no slots for reservation on the first day. Even though we tried to use the app to reserve it. Again was told that have to make reservation in person instead. During stay, calls to front desk wasn’t answered at all. Then why have a phone with a dedicated button for front desk.

Our check-in was about an hour long as there was quite a crowd due to the school holidays. However, our stay was excellent. The room was clean and very comfortable and location was great and accesible to public transports. We would consider coming back again for our next short break!","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

66,1.0,"Stayed here from 18/03 to 20/03 as a family. I would say the room is pretty nice, partly due to the hotel did some renovations recently. Only that the water pressure for the shower is too weak and basin drainage is very slow. Other than that, I've no complains for the room. Their customer service is very very poor. Just imagine, I requested for a single blanket from 8pm. Till 10pm I've yet to receive it. Been calling, even went down to their reception to request for a blanket and all they say is that they will get their runner to deliver it asap. I understand that the hotel may be fully book since it's a school holiday period and occupancy may be full. So the hotel management should do what it takes to cope with the overwhelming orders and request from their in house guest. Lastly, the first floor receptionist should always ensure that their guest does the safe entry check in and temperature taking. But that's not what the receptionist does, he's not attentive and even when I was talking to him to request for the blanket, he's not bothered to reply in a polite manner or even stand up from his seat when I'm talking to him. Sadly, didn't managed to get this receptionist name. For a five star rated hotel, I think there's many room for improvement especially on your customer service and hospitality towards guest.","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5
67,3.0,"Went for a three day staycation here. Room was clean, well-furnished. Breakfast and meals were average. Pool was average. Gym was underwhelming. Staff were friendly but it was constantly a problem to contact front desk via the phone (no one answered most of the time). Overall enjoyable if you want a no-frills place to just chill.

76,1.0,"Had a very unpleasant stay at Grand Park City Hall. Will not recommend this hotel to anyone. Literally checked ourselves out early before 12 and couldn't wait to come home, which never happens on previous staycations or holidays. To be frank, our expectations were quite low to begin with as we have heard negative things about staycations in some hotels in recent months. We did not expect it to be so bad. We have stayed in hotels with less stars but this takes the cake!CHECK-IN:What really bothered us was not so much the waiting times but the lukewarm customer service. Like most reviewers, there was an extremely long wait to check in. The entire lobby was overwhelmed with people and a disproportionate number of working staff. It was made worst by the poor attitudes of their uniformed staff. They were unable to give us an estimated time on how long we had to wait till we got to check in. Their response was ""we don't know"", and they couldn't even be bothered to apologise about it. The security guards and non-uniformed staff however tried their best to make things comfortable for us by offering drinks and snacks. It is sad that their uniformed staff did not meet the mark and we were just herded around like a bunch of cows.BREAKFAST:Customer service was lacking everywhere. Hotel appears to be drowning and clearly requires better management and an increased staff count. During breakfast, we had to wait more than an hour before our food got served. Once again, instead of a courteous apology, we were just given defensive excuses on the long wait. Male front of house appeared to be unhappy when I told him I had been waiting for over an hour. I'm not sure what wrong I did just by asking how long more it would take for breakfast to be served. A simple ""I'm sorry to keep you waiting"" would have sufficed. Perhaps the staff have met many angry customers before us and decided that everyone that raises a question has a personal agenda against them. However, the older female front of house did apologise to us when our meal was served. Kudos to her as she never lost her cool and appeared genuine when speaking to us.ROOM:The room we had was attached to a connecting room and it was paper thin. We could hear every sound and conversation from the other side. We were unlucky to be staying beside guests that blasted their TV till late into the night. On the second night, it was impossible to get a hold of reception and concierge for assistance on the phone despite calling multiple times. We had to personally make our way down to request for help. The room seem a little worn out with the bathroom sink filled with permanent water stains and ring marks. Only plus point would be the presence of a bathtub which you can hardly get elsewhere for the price we paid for.HOUSEKEEPING:Upon coming back after a day out, we noticed strands of hair still present on the floor. Apparently housekeeping did not vacuum the floor and merely tidied up the bed. However, I do empathise with the housekeeper as he seems to be the only one managing one entire floor full of rooms. I'm sure he would appreciate an additional pair of hands.OVERALL:I believe the hotel needs more work in management and staff training. Either increase your staff count - front desk, kitchen and housekeeping or reduce the number of guests you can manage in a day. It would be helpful if they hired more help as everyone clearly looks overworked and exhausted, which might explain the disgruntled attitudes coming from majority of the staff. Very disappointing. Needs a lot of work to bring the standard up. Unfortunately, I am never coming back for a second visit.","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

78,1.0,"strongly doubt that this is a 5 stars hotel. the hotel standard and service is extremely bad. there are no communication within staff / departments. totally regret booking this hotel right from the start. 1. had email the hotel immediately after i made the booking that i will be here for my anniversary stay for 3 days 2 nights and requested for early check-in. the reservation department took 3 days to give me an general reply and selective replying to my questions. 2. 1 day prior to my check-in, i received an email from the hotel requesting us to select our staggered check-in timing. however to my horror, the check-in process was ridiculous long. waited for 2 hours before i could get a room. by the time i get into my room, it was already 4pm. i do not understand why does the hotel implemented the staggered check-in when they cant manage the crowd. all the guests are crowded in the waiting cornet when the check-in counters at level 3 are empty.3. in order to use the hotel facilities, you have to pre-book. however, the system is super inflexible. you can only book the facilities for the next day usage ONCE. no multiple booking and same day booking are NOT allowed. assuming you are only here for 2 days 1 night, there is a huge time constrain. the swimming pool was small and pathetic, filled with people. no safe distancing at all. we left the swimming pool after 5 mins and we cant book the swimming pool again for the same day. 4. housekeeping was rude. im supposed to check out on 16 Mar. but on 15 Mar, around 3pm housekeeping press the door bell and open my room door before i could reach the door. the first thing the housekeeping said was, no check out? it was super rude for the housekeeping to just open my room door, they should give us some reaction time. i don't fly from the room to the door.","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

91,4.0,"Good location hotel. Booked it via klook because of value for money after using SRV. And we like the concept/interior design of the room. But service can be better/improved as it is quite slow. Arrival area lack of manpower. It seems like there is only 1 person working. After waiting for a while, we were then told that there is another check-in counter at level 3 (if I’m not wrong). Upon check-in, my partner was telling the front office lady that the hotel feels quite warm (air con was not strong). Her reply was quite cold and said that because we came from outside and it takes time to cool down. But there is really a big difference from the hotel room and the lobby, lift area.Service in the hotel is a little slow in terms of calling for housekeeping. Not too sure about dining as we didn’t dine in the hotel. A few times we need to call the front desk from the room, but either it took quite long to pick up or no one pick up. Hotel room lack of soundproofing as well as we can hear some other room having party past midnight. We have to call front desk to send their security to check the commotion. This time, actions was fast as the security (I assumed it’s security?) came up to check. Thereafter, the noise quiet down. Overall, the bed mattress and pillow quality is good as it is not too soft like some other hotels. We had quality sleep still. Though the bathroom sink area and kettle have some water stains, the shower and bathtub is considerably clean. Despite the lack of warmth service in the hotel, we still had quite a pleasant stay.","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5
92,4.0,"Was an overall pleasant stay, we really love the ambience in the hotel even though the facade did not reflect this. We had a good swim in the pool and also had breakfast at the hotel. We also had a lot of fun with the advance tech in the hotel. Would definitely come again!","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5
93,3.0,"The bad:- Check-in experience was terrible. Be prepared to wait 1) outside the hotel entrance for at least 30 mins, 2) at the first floor lobby for 20 mins with almost nil air con and 3) at the third floor waiting rooms for another 10-15 mins. The most unpleasant part was the lack of aircon. Be prepared to just sweat it out. - Checked into the room and was unable to set to a cooler temp despite adjusting the controls on the app panel. Called concierge/front desk and was told to troubleshoot on our own/give some time for the room to cool. After calling multiple times waiting for technician that never turned up the front desk finally came up to our room at 11+pm (because temp was still stuck at 25 degrees) and eventually informed us later that the aircon was indeed faulty before finally switching our room. - Extremely shorthanded/unhelpful staff. Front desk doesn’t pick up after calling multiple times and it was unmanned multiple times. Front desk staff was generally unhelpful with the issues raised. Standard response was that they had limited human resources to help with our issues due to high volume. Technician/housekeeping that were supposed to be sent up to our room never turned up. - Found dirt on multiple walls of the shower.  These weren’t mold formed. It’s literally just dirt on the windows and shower walls.- Inefficient breakfast booking system. Booked 10am slot but was only ushered in 25 mins later as tables were still unavailable. The okay: - At the third floor waiting rooms, each group of guests were ushered to a seemingly vacant run down office space. It’s just a weird hotel check in experience. Oh and don’t expect the waiting room to have air con. It’s still non-existent.The good: - Nice room (minus the dirt on the shower wall) and great location with Raffles City and Funan mall nearby. - Ala carte breakfast selection was pretty good. Breakfast staff was quick to serve.- After all the mishaps with our first room, we were allowed a later check out time of 3pm.Overall: Nice hotel room with great location, but lacking the service experience due to shorthanded/unhelpful staff. May have been a better experience if we had gone during non-peak days. Definitely would not recommend going during weekend/holidays. ","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5
94,3.0,"1. Check is not proper. No signs boards to let us know where to go. Was quite confusing. No staff to tell us where is the direction. Everyone seem to ignore. We have to interrupt the staffs to ask. Directed to head to level 3, approach the receptionist and staffs did not seemed bothered. Had to ask if this is where we are supposed to check in. 2. Directed to a ‘run down office like’ waiting room with again no staff telling us what to do. Had to approach a male staff to ask if this is the correct area to check in. Directed to sit at table number 7. Staffs seemed to be all over the place as guests keeps coming in. 3. Male staff approach and ask for our IC. Did not even ask for our booking confirmation which was unusual. 4. Female staff approached 10 minutes later and  ask if we had proof of making a reservation at the hotel. We showed her our trip dot com app and she got shocked and said “trip dot com??” (Like as though she was not aware that there are 3rd party apps using rediscover voucher to book hotels in Singapore) she asked when did we make the booking as though she did not believed us. 5. She came back in another 10 minutes and said she found our booking and proceed for us to fill the covid19 form. 6. Female staff was also not pleasant in explaining for our stay. She was long winded talking about stuffs like join hotel membership etc. Told us to “make sure you check out tomorrow at 12”. We feel unwelcome and it felt as though she did not want us to be there. What if in the event someone had the intention to extend their stay and a hotel staffs were to say such things??6. Hotel and amenities was great. Swimming pool/gym staffs was friendly, nice and professional. 7. Called receptionist many times for some inquiries but no one answered. Head down to level 3 and saw 3 staffs using their mobile phones. Overall, hotel was great without a doubt, we did had a pleasant stay but the staff service could actually be improved. The process of checking in should perhaps need to be reviewed extensively. It felt like the staffs were overwhelmed and The waiting area could and should be improved. Staffs were even confused on whose IC belongs to who and approach us to ask if this is our IC when clearly its not. ","Grand Park City Hall Hotel, Singapore",4.5

9,5.0,"First impressions, the check-in queue was really long. At one point in time there were 35 people in the queue. While there were 8 check-in counters, I waited about 25 to 30 minutes in line. I do appreciate the service staff who were doing their best to manage the crowd. I was upgraded from a Deluxe Room to a Premier Room which is much more spacious but does not have the bathtub. The room looks nice, with a good view of the Orchard area, and also MBS. Toiletries including toothbrush and shower caps are also provided. The Wi-Fi here is pretty fast, with download speeds at 85Mbps and upload speeds at 21Mbps. Next to the work table, there is also a HDMI port which you can plug your laptop to watch shows on Netflix. Otherwise, there's a large variety of cable channels. The mattress of the bed is firm. However, I would prefer the pillows to be a little more firm. I slept with one pillow, and it felt like it was not providing me sufficient support. I tried with two pillows, but it was too high for my liking. Use of the gym is made through booking by the hour. A tip is to email the concierge a few days in advance to make your booking. I was not able to book the pool as it was fully booked. It was also a little troublesome, as you would need to go to the concierge on the 5th floor to obtain the gym access card before taking the lift up to the 36th floor. From there, you would need to pass through a few doors and climb a few flights of staircases to get to the 37th floor. The gym is pretty spacious and has several equipment. It has a smith machine, a rowing machine, three treadmills, a rack of weights, a cable machine and 6 other machines for specific exercises. Upon entering, you can grab a towel. There is also cupboards for you to leave your items in. There are toilets inside the gym. I also found a water dispenser and a microwave too (perhaps a pantry area). Throughout my stay, one of the annoying things was the lifts. There are a total of six lifts, but I believe only five are operational. You would need to observe carefully for which lift lights up. In some cases, if you are too late, even if you press the lift buttons, the doors will still close on you.  At the end of the day, I really liked the convenience of the hotel being connected to Mandarin Gallery, and that you could be in the heart of Orchard Road within 3 minutes.",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0

I was working in healthcare and was able to qualify for a special promo for a deluxe room. I wasn’t expecting a lot as the price was pretty cheap. However, to my surprise, the hotel staff who attended to me was really nice, a Japanese lady, and she upgraded me to a next tier room which was a bonus for me and even offered me slightly late checkout. I’m truly blown away by the service I received at the hotel. The check in was swift and easy, the check out was automatic, by dropping keys in a express check out box. And the room was impressive, very clean and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! Highly recommended for anyone looking for an escape from home or in the future as a hotel to consider. Furthermore, the location is right in the middle of orchard, perfect for shopping and access to train stations!",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0

Even after showing print-out of my booking correspondences on this, they can only give a me a room at level 15 that is further away from the lift (not corner room) out of 37 floors. Really disappointing.

17,4.0,"2nd visit as we had a corporate promo. Our first visit was a month ago where the experience wasn't that great. This time, the check in queue was long but it was more organised. They only allowed one person of the party to join the queue and opened up a waiting room for all other members.The room we got had signs of wear and tear, similar to the previous experience. But it was comfortable, especially with the many channels on the TV and a bathtub. There was a promo for in room dining the previous time, but the promo has changed to only 30% of Chatterbox. (Previously it was 50%). Breakfast was more organised with better tasting food this time. It seems they do action on feedback! The location is very good and convenient. The government shut the hotel down on the day that we were checking out due to suspected COVID cases. We read about it online and the staff were transparent enough to confirm it before the mainstream media reported it. The staff whom we interacted with at the reception, restaurant, in room dining were all very friendly and professional. Overall, a comfortable experience but would be better if they don't accept so many bookings because the arrival process did dampen the mood a little. We saw that the carpark was full and had to turn up to a few levels before getting a lot.",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0
18,1.0,"1) After check in, the TV was fine. After went out and came back, TV not working and need to call service counter and ask technician to came over and fix it. 2) Bathroom : Brown water flowing out from the tap. (i) We call service counter, they said they will ask someone up and check. (ii) So we wait in the room but no one came and phone rang. So i pick up and they said will arrange another room for us which is lower level as this issue was only encounter on high floor which not only us affected. So i ask her back, does that mean lower level confirm wont have this issue and she reply yes and ask us to give them 10 min and will return us a call because they need to check any available room. (iii) We waited for 10min and no call return and wondering why they check 1 available room need to take so long as we thought is just checking by using computer system and they will know which room is available ? If there are no available room , why is there no call back with updates ? So we call back again and they said that they still checking. I got no idea why but maybe they really changing the room for the entire floor. (iv) After waiting for almost 1 hour, finally we able to change our room. So while walking to another room, i ask the bellman is it just only us ? And he reply yes. So... the service counter told me that our level got this issue but why is it just only us changing the room? Does that mean the rest of the guests are using dirty water to bath/drink without notice the water are dirty? Eeww... (v) So when we enter the new room, we check the water again and.... the result was expected. Is the SAME ! Dont know is it because we unlucky or what. Refer back to 2(iv), the counter told me that only HIGH LEVEL but why change to lower level still the same? And why they never check first before we change to another room? (vi) So we wait again !!! And the bellman said that they will shift us to another tower. So after shifting to another tower and room, finally the water is clean and all this issue happened during midnight, we request to extend the check out timing and ask the bellman to let the counter know. 3) After shifting to the new room i thought the tv they will activate for us after we confirm that the room are okay but we waited 10min and tv not activated so we call service counter again and activate it. 4) Next day morning, we go for breakfast at chatterbox and my friend was wearing their bedroom slipper and they told us that bedroom slipper is not allowed in the restaurant so we went up to our room to change the footwear and THE KEYCARD NOT ACTIVATED 5) So we go to service counter and check on the key card and the staff told us that the check out timing is 11am. We was like why is 11am as last night you'll promise to give us late check out. 6) So the staff update the check out timing accordingly and she went up together with us and to confirm the card is working. 7) After settle the card, we go for our breakfast. One breakfast serving need to wait 45min !? What if check out timing is 11am and we go breakfast at 10am, is there enough time for us to pack and go ? 8) After the check out, we ask the staff at the counter what exactly happen and why the water are in this color and she said is because that tower room been empty for a month which cause this issue. So we check with her if this issue is solved and she reply yes. 9) After that i sent a feedback online and it stated that they will reply within 24hrs but seems like i waited for more than 24 hours. Although i did get a reply from them and did apologies but i feel that they are just entertaining me because there's no follow up from themafter. Is this how they manage the guest feedback? In tripadvisor review i saw that one of the review also mention that the water is yellowish during Aug 2020. Does that mean this issue from August 2020 till Feb 2021, they did not resolved this issue at all ? Isn't Singapore a clean and green country ? With this type of water quality, how does it display the image of singapore water ? What a memorable stay for my friends & I. We just cant imagine that what if some of the guest did not notice the water condition and bath or rinse their mouth with the dirty water. Eew.... In their email reply they did mentioned that as a gesture of goodwill, they will extend a special rate for us if we could give them another chance to serve us but will you ever spend money on this hotel again with this type of water condition? And i was wondering if the management realise the building name become"" v ANDARIN ORCHARD ""? From FEB till MAR, this does not seems to be fixed. How does this look like a 5 star hotel?",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0

During my check in , arrive on time ... check on with Max was fast. Clear and detail explanation by Max also. Easy to understand . Was upgraded to Club floor 3021 to reduce the noise from the current minor works going on .  Another simple and thoughtful mindset by Max. Went into the room , my wife was surprise with the cake and the lovely swan...I nearly have to sleep on the floor .. coz the swan is too lovely to destroy. Hahaha..

22,3.0,"Mandarin Orchard's only strength is its staff. The Guest Services team were polite and very helpful and the Housekeeping team similarly cheery and maintained excellent cleanliness. The room was free of major defects but Mandarin Orchard's soft product was unfortunately, extremely disappointing. For breakfast at the renowned Chatterbox, you're limited to 1 main course order per pax - which, if you go for the American breakfast is 1 egg, 2 strips of malnourished bacon, 1 slice of triangular ham that reminded me of you'd get at an Army cookhouse, 2 miniature sausages and some chili sauce. You do get free flow of fruits and bread (read: any two of a croissant, red velvet cupcake and something that very mildly resembled a Danish) coffee/tea/juice but honestly, charging $32 nett for this is frankly absurd. I regret not walking out of the restaurant when the plates were served. The quality of the food was somehow even more disappointing than the quantity. If you're looking to book, go for a rate that doesn't include breakfast. You would genuinely enjoy a tastier, more fulfilling, better made meal at a nearby Toastbox. Also ice is chargeable at $6. I do hope the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment can negotiate a better deal for Singapore's water supply because $6 for about a litre of ice is pricing you'd expect on the International Space Station.",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0
23,5.0,"I booked the staycation last year and due to some cases of covid19 infection in this hotel, it was push till this year.  As i do not have annual leave due to change of new job, i have to choose in Feburary which happened to be my birthday.  The hotel was informed of my birthday, they upgraded my room without me asking and even prepared a nice cake upon arrival. I was surprised to receive the cake as I do not expect a whole cake. The morning breakfast was decent. The room was spacious and clean.  Overall it was a smooth stay. Checked in only takes 25minutes and check out is a breeze. However, i would suggest to have the reception table cleaned after every guest as one of the hotel in the city was doing. Some of the guests crowded at the counter to wait  for the family member to check in.Also in the room, the other hotel nearby had hand wipes on table to welcome guest and a covid safe card to rest assured guests that the room have been cleaned and safe.

Firstly, the booking process wasn't that great: I was not redirected to the confirmation page so I gave them a ring to check if it went through. Linda picked up and told me ""they [reservations] already went home so you ask me I also cannot do anything"". I didn't expect that from a 5-star establishment who charges $170 for half a day on an entry-level room. The check in process was awkward: it took around 15 minutes and we were the only one there. Furthermore, my partner was asked whether he had paid already, of course he has why would we have an online booking if he didn't. They nearly charged us again for the room. The room itself was nice, clean, with a spacious bathroom. It's located at a prime location so that's a plus.

26,2.0,"Summary: This hotel stay would make a decent 2 to 3-star equivalent. If you're traveling with infant(s) or if you want the full 5-star experience, you're better off picking another hotel.On to the Specifics:Check-in:efficient, and well-managed due to the covid situation. They are extra cautious now because of the recent transmissions in this hotel.- Insufficient chairs for the influx of check-in guests. My aged Parents had to stand, as it was overcrowded. NOTE: the lobby is inconveniently located on level 5, so if you want to check out, swim, go to the gym, or go to concierge, you'll have to make a stop on this floor, before going to your destination.Room:- very old, and in dire need of renovations- they cut corners doing up the room:- floor is uneven, and there are dips and depressions all over the place, hastily covered up by the carpet- no bedside power socket. only ONE socket at the desk, so you cannot keep your phone by your bedside- no tissue in room, only in bathroom. - TV is miniscule- lights are controlled by a very user-UNfriendly old-school box. You'll hit every button on that darned thing in the middle of the night before getting it right.- no freezer, so mummies be warned, if you require ice bags for your milk.****They actually CHARGE $3 for a small pack of ice** so mummies be doubly warned!*****Bathroom- faulty shower. I'll spare you the details but after being told that I CANNOT shower, and would have to wait till the next day, and a LOT of unhappy phone calls to the manager, it took them almost 2hours to fix it, which they completed at 1045pm. I only got to shower when I requested to be let into a different room just to shower. baby stuff:- took them almost 2 hours to deliver the baby cot. Our baby missed his nap and was crying as a result. - Other 5-star hotels usually provide baby amenities like bath/shower gel. Not this hotel. Gym/pool:- again, you'd have to head to lvl 5 to get the keycard at your allotted slot, before heading to the gym or pool- pool is absolutely tiny. Seems like an afterthought. Because of its size, it has a 10pax limit, so you will not be able to book the pool unless you book at least a few days in advance.- No poolside bar.- in dire need of renovationsStaff/service:- huge thumbs up for the cleaning staff, and the poolside staff, who were very friendly and helpful. They even warned us that our room slippers are very slippery when wet (when they saw us carrying our baby)- Operator and Manager (I think it was Linda?) were lacking in their follow-up, with regard to our faulty shower. They were unhelpful and inefficient, and didn't offer alternatives. In the end, I had to request that they allow me into a different  room just to shower. I think this is a conveniently-located hotel with the basic necessities, offering a decent 2-star to 3-star feel. If you get a good price here, by all means give it a go.If however, you're looking to have a luxurious 5-star staycation, I would definitely recommend that you look elsewhere.",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0
27,4.0,"Stayed at Mandarin Orchard for 2 nights in January. It was my second time staying at the property (the first was many years ago) but the first time post COVID-19. We were granted early check-in and it was done efficiently. Service was friendly and we were upgraded to the Club Floor at the Orchard Wing. View from the room the was nice, the room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable. I believe the hotel does need refreshing and refurbishing as the decor is rather dated. I’m not sure if there are newly renovated rooms though. The one we stayed in is definitely not one of them. Otherwise, the overall stay was good! Breakfast at Chatterbox was rather standard, could’ve been better in my opinion. I liked that it’s very conveniently located and there are plenty of eating and shopping options along Orchard Road.

30,4.0,Back after years to celebrate our wedding anniversary and definitely like us things changes over the years. Previously where we enter the hotel was via a driveway along Orchard Road it's now at the side next to Ngee Ann City. Check-in is on the 5th floor. Room was well appointed and with bathtub. Only complain-there is a window looking out the bathroom to the main room and each time we turn on the lights in the night everyone is awoken with the bathroom light coming through the tainted window. King bed and pillows were comfortable. Parking is redeemable at Concierge each entry/exit. Breakfast now limited to a small list due to Covid. Very friendly and approachable staff. Appreciate the hotel retaining her aged local staff and making it more homely and another attraction to stay at Mandarin. For our special occasion Mandarin took the effort to decorate the room and present us with a small cake to celebrate.

I stayed in a Club Room each time and enjoyed breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. The food was delicious and sufficient quality for the price point. There is not much alcoholic beverages to select from during evening cocktails but was still ok.

Our stay thereafter in the executive suite was also great! We especially loved the cocktail time at the Top of the M. They were super generous with the alcohol and bites we didn’t even have the stomach to eat dinner thereafter.

Eg : drop off and pick up. Getting a cab. Lobby : A long line to check in but it wasnt that bad. The queue was moving. We were given a bottle of water. There were hotel staffs walking ard talking and explaining and letting us know whats happening. Front office : Check in process was quite fast though we had to wait for our room but were given free coffee at the cafe. Check in staff was friendly and accomodative.Room : A little dusty but still bearable else we wld have ask for a room change ( allergies ), but room was clean. Bed was ok. Pillow was ok. Toilet was ok. Typically a normal hotel room. Pool : Weird as we had to walk pass the lobby to get to the pool and walk back ( wet ) to get back to the room. It was literally the other side of the hotel but pool was freezing cold and it was nice. Clean and spacious. Totally like the fact that they lay the green carpeted grass all around the pool.. makes it so much easier to walk esp with kids. Breakfast : of a different kind ( cooooooviddddd ) so we were given a piece of paper and to tick our choice and it was brought over to us. The taste and presentation was disappointing.

After analysis of the situation and the 4 groups of family members (which include various generation a child,2 teenage, a 90 year old, a cancer patient) that are staying during this school holiday staycation, I came with a plan for a 3 days 2 nights stay over during an extreme busy weekends ( 11 Dec - 13 Dec 2020). 1) Came early to register first, understand that rooms might not be ready till 2pm.Requested for same floor. Patience with the receptionist. Go for a walk (Garden or shopping) and have a nice lunch.2)Tried to book for a swimming, but fully booked, request to be on queue. Smile and be nice to the  concierge.3) Wake up early to have peace and quiet breakfast. Based on my families profile, they cant be rushed during meals period. Resulted:1) Receptionist Max (If I gotten the name correctly) check in us with a genuine smile and polite throughout the registration. We gotten our rooms on same floor, bonus points, we got high floor with great views. That helps us alot, most of the time we seated by the window talk about past and stories. 2)During lunch my phone started to inform us that our rooms are ready. We take our time for our lunch without rushing. Meeting the rest of our families at 2.30pm and everyone are happily in their rooms by 2.45pm. I only have to show my key holders to concierge Matthew, without delaying he prepares the keys for us. No one got caught in the queue3) a surprise called on the following day sounded glad and delighted by Sazali (Concierge)  at 9.30am informing us there is a slot avail at 10am as someone cancelled. We already had breakfast, so gladly take the slot. The young and oldest went to pool, the big 'spenders' went to Robinson to grab. Another of our family goal achieve.  4) During our stay, we met friendly and smiley staff like John and Daisy asking about our stay engaging small talks with us. 5) We did not really enjoy our 1st day of breakfast in Triple 3 (Food and Service), we made the right choice to go chatterbox the follow day for breakfast. Although both places service the same types of food but we have marvelous food and great service in chatterbox. The food were tasty, the service staffs have eyes for details . 6) I made the effort to settle the bills at the reception after breakfast on the last day. It was hassle -free, as there is no queue, no stress. The beautiful lady, receptionist ( Have accidentally forgotten her name) service with bright red smile. Had requested for late check out and was given till 1pm for all rooms.7) Our families totally understand the hotel situation and had vacant the rooms by noon. Dropped their keys at express checkout box and went out to have a nice lunch.

49,3.0,"Very good location. Hotel is a bit old, but room is clean and well-maintained. They can definitely improve on the TV, which currently feels like 20 years ago (it's not a smart TV), where only pay-per-view is available, with no Netflix or ability to connect to iPhone casting wirelessly.What is very disappointing are (1) food quality and (2) customer service which is rather impersonal. Breakfast is a big let down (a la carte, not buffet, and priced at $36 before 17.7% taxes if not yet included in your room package), so you would be much better off taking that money and eat at other cafes/restaurants in Orchard. The ""famous"" Chatterbox chicken rice (priced at $28 before 17.7% taxes) is also a major disappointment -- we ordered it delivered to room, and the chicken is generally dry, bland in taste, an shockingly, rather cold. Again, you can take the money and get a much better deals at other famous chicken rice shops in Singapore.Customer service was generally efficient when things go right, but rather impersonal -- expect to be ""processed"" as if you are just part of hundreds of guests that stay there, with very little personal touch extended. When things go wrong, customer service became even worse. On our 2nd day, there was news that there might be a COVID-19 transmissions within the hotel, and all guests were required by the government to check out by the next day. While this was a government direction, it was no deniable that the inconvenience caused is partially the hotel's responsibility. However, the staff that handled our check-out offered no apology, no flexibility to extend the dining credit that was part of our hotel package, or no compensation (even if token) for the stay that need to be cut short whatsoever. Instead, we were only told off the policy (that we could either check out early and stay for the first night we have stayed, or check out the next day and pay for 2 nights) as if we are just part of the number that needs to be processed. So overall, my recommendation is book early, and choose some other hotels that may cost the same but with better customer service.",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0

Our main gripe was the extremely disappointing food at Chatterbox. The food was really mediocre despite the sky high prices. We ate there for dinner & breakfast using our vouchers. if we had to pay actual prices for the food, it is totally not worth it. Given the sky high prices, we had huge expectations of the food. $30 for a plate of ok nasi goreng or a bowl of terrible wanton noodles is just ridiculous. Even the world famous chicken rice that came with hainanese pork chop was soggy & not fragrant.Xx",Mandarin Orchard Singapore Hotel,4.0

Then, we had some trouble trying to access the lift with our hotel card but was assisted by a very humble man at the concierge. Then, when we entered the hotel room, there was a nice chocolate cake on the table as it was our wedding anniversary. I would like to thank all your staff for the service provided.

This means we had to use the spare gpo at the work desk and also unplug the lamp sitting on the work desk. Also, where the kettle is positioned, the cable length of the kettle doesn't reach the gpo provided near the floor. We had to move the kettle to the work desk and use the gpo there.

We previously stayed in Sofitel Sentosa & Grand Hyatt, but Mandarin Orchard is by far our favorite!I would like to personally thank Syaza who made our stay very memorable. Given the COVID situation, you will need to pre-book hotel facilities (this is the same for all hotels). Syaza was very attentive and offered to book pool & gym slots for us. Being a very active couple we were really happy about this! Aside from that, she told us where to park our car, where to get the complimentary parking coupons, informed us in advance that our room service bill will be charged from my deposit since we are doing express check out.She was stationed at the Meritus Club Lounge and I guess hotels are getting super crowded these days due to everyone trying to book staycations. Even more so with the Singapore Rediscover Vouchers. However despite the crowd, she remained cheerful & welcoming. I have the utmost respect for staff like her who can keep calm in such situations. To the Mandarin Orchard Management who is reading this, please do send Syaza my thanks & I hope you can take this feedback in consideration during your staff evaluation.P.S. the hotel offers 30% off in-room dining.

The main hotel check-in area on the 5th storey was very crowded, but thankfully we were able to check-in on the 38th floor, which was emptier and much nicer.We had access to the Meritus Lounge on the 39th floor, which offered complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea/buffet and cocktails (which offered light food as well). The food quality was not bad, nothing to write home about, but a nice thing to have. And great views!The room itself (the space of two regular rooms) was spacious, one side for sleeping and the other side for lounging. One full bath and one powder room.The bedlinen was ok, not the highest quality. Bath linen was fine.The Bathroom was spacious and well-lit, well-equipped. The shower is not that large to begin with, and the fancy shower control column reduced the space further - I’d have been happy with more space and water pressure, and a simple rainshower. I didn’t use the bathtub.They delivered a small fruit basket on our arrival. The hotel staff were generally helpful and friendly, commendable especially at this time when mask-wearing makes everything more difficult.The room decor can charitably be described as “classic”; some may call it dated.

Thankfully the view made up for the small space.  We could see the Sports Hub, the Singapore Flyer and Village Hotel at Bugis. Amenities was basic with toothbrushes, shower gel and conditioning shampoo.  I didn't like the dispenser with sheets of paper I stead of a toilet roll.  Thankfully I was prepared and brought my own toilet roll.There is a writing table, a chair and a beside table.  Bottled water was provided and the mini fridge was cold enough to store your own stuff. No bathroom slippers were provided and we weren't sure if the floor was clean enough to sit on so we sat on the bed most of the time. There is a swimming pool, a gym, a terrace and a restaurant Jubilicious on level 4.  Breakfast is served at Jubilicious from 6.30 to 10.30 with a choice or western breakfast or Nasi lemak.  Bread and coco krunch were provided and each of us got a cup of yogurt.  Fruit juice was cordial but thankfully, there were slices of watermelon and oranges given.  All in all, the breakfast was simple but tasty and substantial.The hotel is in a strategic position with Kampong Glam diagonally across the road.  Walking to City Square is possible and Bugis is also not too far away. Check out was easy too.  At 2.30pm the phone rang to give a reminder on the check.out.  At the reception area, there were many guests checking in and out and additional staff appeared to help out.

Could hear people walking and talking in the corridors easily.Breakfast needs to seriously be improved though. The serers were very welcoming and polite with warm smiles, however the western and asian breakfasts should be served hot. It was barely lukewarm. Especially when your serving food like scrambled eggs and bacon, ham and sausage and pancakes, all these should be hot. Its a good thing customers could still toast the bread which was provided so that was hot. The nasi lemak wasn't anything much to say about.","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

The auntie in charge of room sanitation is friendly, helpful and quick when we asked for fresh pillow cases. The cons are hairdryer doesn’t work, dated decor and furnishings, poor soundproofing, secondhand smoke from neighbours on the balcony. It’s a non smoking hotel but people flout the rules, which isn’t the hotel’s fault but dampens the experience. I can hear my neighbours quarrelling at night and loud traffic below.

7,3.0,"Big hotel with many small rooms. Kind of like sewage smell in the premises and in our room. Poor sound proof as I’m a light sleeper, could hear somebody talking in the middle of 3am. We stayed the inward facing family room with balcony, only view is another room just opposite. Noise with echo can project from this inward area, which I could also hear in the middle of night with a group of people talking and laughing. Is more light a chalet rather a hotel. From picture room floor looks light laminated wood flooring but is actually tiles with woody design. Our family have another premier balcony room which is better at least is city view with big balcony. Felt complex if you drive to the carpark, you will see lots of motor cycle at level 2, some even ride recklessly. However the Terrace at level 4 quite chilled in the morning after breakfast took from there, nice place to walk around. Staff from restaurant is helpful, overall the hotel staff is ok.

I like that there's smart tv in the room with you tube app as there'was just local channels to watch. Wifi was good. Checked in was pretty fast and no hassle. The pool area were nice with sitting area to enjoy the windy breeze.Overall it was ok. Location wise is centralized good.","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0
9,4.0,"Stayed with family in two rooms which were, quite frankly, tiny but functional - small fridge, big windows, area to hang clothes and accommodate small luggages, desk and some drawers, one side table with storage space underneath etc Bathrooms were small too but it has adequate space for shower cabin, shelf for toiletries, sink with adequate space for other toiletries and makeup stuff ( very important for ladies). Ironing facilities are provided in a separate place.  The only reason why I’m deducting one star is the room size - if you come with large luggages, as people normally do when travelling Asia, you might want to consider a much bigger than their standard room which will cost more I imagine. Even then, it feels rather stuffy because of the very little space in which to manoeuvre. Regardless,  Everything looks reasonably clean and well-maintained.  I’ve given them the 4 stars because they are situated in an excellent area with lots of eateries for different budgets and preferences: pizzas, Korean chicken wings, durian restaurant, Chinese food court including vegetarian stall, Malay mixed rice, Arab food, Indonesian nasi padang or Indian food like briyani/sup kambing/mutton chop, dim sum restaurant,  Japanese ramen restaurant, and many many more. Close to Bugis for shopping;, I like to go to their Uniqlo outlet as there are lots of stuff on sale. Oh it’s close to the Sultan mosque so many restaurants in the area are certified halal as is one of the restaurants in which you have your breakfast in the hotel (if it’s in your package) but just go out and find breakfast, eat like a local - kingly and your stomach, a bottomless pit.There’s a good sized pool and a gym, short walk from lavender MRT which is close to the airport. Hurray! considering the price we paid for the room; a bargainThe staff are very professional, warm and friendly, who I must say, are rather flexible in their approach rather than sticklers for rules (that’s a huge plus, am I right?)- they let us check in much earlier and check out later than expected. Made it easy for me to check in for my brother even though he wasn’t there using a photo of his IC etc. I mean, they were all cool; every single one i’ve met, including the ones checking our temperatures ( this was during covid) it feels rather “homey”I recommend this place if you are planning to stay short term and don’t have a lot with you (or get a bigger room), especially if you just want to enjoy food with your partner or the facilities, just don’t expect to watch good stuff on TV. (TV channels suck big time) WiFi in our room was ok as was the thermostat. Good water pressure. Corridor can be quite noisy but generally people are respectful. But if you come during covid period, there is a limit on the number of people allowed in the pool premises  + max 1 hour only, FYI.","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

12,4.0,"Hotel Boss is about the location. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and Lavender MRT Station is 200m away. Bugis and City Hall area is a short bus ride away and Kampong Glam is within walking distance. Check-in was surprisingly quick, given the long queues inside the lobby as well as 2 separate long queues outside the hotel (one along its drop-off point via Syed Alwi Road and another along its front - Victoria Street). The staff were friendly and welcoming. Pretty good attitude given the large crowd and check-ins.It's a mid-range hotel with many rooms. The rooms, however, are pretty small. Tiny, I would say. I have got a Triple Room and the distance between the foot of the bed and the desk is about a person's width. The en-suite toilet is tiny too. A big-sized guy like me would hit the wall or the basin when I changed inside the toilet. There are no traditional toilet paper dispenser. Instead, what was installed was a tissue paper in a cylindrical container where you pulled down piece by piece. This was installed by the mirror behind you if you used the bowl, so it was pretty inconvenient. The water strength of the tap and showers were good. Toiletries and towels were provided and replenished/changed daily. The bed was comfortable but only one pillow was provided and the pillow was thin. The air-con is pretty strong and given the small size of the rooms, the room was cooled pretty quickly. There is no wardrobe but an open-style hanging system was used with 6 hangers. Coffee and tea was provided as well as a kettle. The mini-fridge was great! The strength was great and chilled my drinks quickly.One really bad thing about Hotel Boss is that they have pretty thin walls. I could hear the muffled sounds of my next-door neighbours talking and the sound of the TV. There were some shouting two doors down and that was audible. Had to call the staff up to handle and they did a pretty good job. The in-room telephone wasn't working well and I could not hear anything after 2 calls down to the reception but they sent a guy up after that to make sure things were good. Breakfast was provided and served at their 4th floor Halal-certified restaurant. It was a choice between a Chinese or Western set. Serving was great with the typical breakfast items, in addition to yogurt, bread and cereal with milk. There were queues at certain times of breakfast (after 9.30am) but that was probably due to the high occupancy rate.All in all, I believe the Triple Room I stayed in was too cosy for 3 adults. I loved the service and condition of the room. It was convenient to get to a lot of places. However, one thing to note is that they would locked the front doors (facing Victoria Street) from 9pm-5am and you would have to access via its drop-off point (facing Syed Alwi Road and Kallang River).","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

The shower is working well. No problem with the sink. Its not 32m square so thats why the room I rent was a little squeezy. But I am roaming around most of the time outdoor. The Plasma TV was great too. Overall had a nice stay.Thank you.,"Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

The location is good as it isnot too far from the city. It is also suitable for couples for a Staycation asmine was Queen size bed.

After the recommendation of a friend, who told us that the beds and facilities at the hotel were very good despite the small room and the poor service, we decided to try to ask for a quote. Since it is a ""different"" quote, I thought it would be better not to book on the website and I tried several forms of communication, all without answer, until now. Today we made a call and were attended by a rude person, difficult to understand, who insisted that we would be doing SHN when it is not the case and in the end he ordered us to book on the website. People urgently need to be better trained, this is not acceptable for a hospitality industry","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

22,4.0,"Today is my last day of my staycation at hotel boss and i think i shall give my thoughts on this hotel. I booked the room with the balcony and my room is on the 14 floor. The view out of the balcony is pretty mediocre but in my opinion (FYI: the balcony have no privacy at all so PLEASE do not be in your birthday suit). Jokes aside, when i entered into the room the first time i was surprised that it was soooo small when i say small i meant really small but it isnt much of a problem. The cleanliness of the room i’d say is 4.5/5. The bed is decent size and comes with 2 pillow total one for me and one for my GF. On the second day we decided to ask for 2 more pillow and when we ask the counter for pillow, i was greeted with a kind gentleman that promptly asked me for my room number and told me that he will send his staff up and true enough 5 minutes later my room door rang and i was greeted with a staff with 2 pillow. We ate at Papasan 17 located at the first floor of the hotel, the food portion and prices of the food were great. Taste wise it is decent. We visited famous food places close to the hotel such as golden mile food center and Jalan sultan prawn noodles and went to places such as Bugis and Clark Quay. Overall i didnt had much interaction with the staff but i had a rather decent experience here for the price. The few cons i had about this place is the lack of discipline the staff have towards the noise that is generated by other guests. Due to the thin wall, every noise that produce by the next room can literally be heard very clearly. The room beside us is blasting music at 2:41am and it is rather annoying as we are trying to get some rest to wake up early tomorrow morning to check out. Overall i will rate the experience here a 4/5. Since you’ve read all the way until here means my review is good so please consider giving it a thumbs up or like or something :D ps: sorry i didnt include any picture for reference","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

27,4.0,"After quite a bit of search and through scanning of the hotels in Singapore we freezed on this as it was our first trip. Location wise I would say one of the best, centrally located close to Bugis and Lavender MRT stations and close proximity to Orchard road, city hall and Bugis, buses available a step away. The famous Arab street is just a short walk away. The lobby of the room was really nice but the rooms were really small. Check-in was a breeze but the front office could be a little more courteous. Many restaurants and food options in the vicinity and we decided not to opt for in-house breakfast and thought to explore the many eateries in the surrounding.  Overall we stayed for 5 nights and I would recommend this place to fellow travelers.","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0
28,3.0,"My family went on a one night staycation on 19 Dec. The lobby was nice but the room was really small. But still clean in general, except for a few ants crawling around on the table. We were served by Fiona and Lionel at the lobby upon registration. They were very friendly and helpful. They made us felt warmly welcomed and answered all our enquiries regarding our stay. I was pleased with the accommodation and food, however, i was very upset and disappointed by the swimming pool queueing system. We had staycations at other hotels before and the swimming pool slots were assigned and we just had to come down to the pool during our assigned timeslot. For Hotel Boss, we had to rush down to queue in our swimming wear as it was based on first come first serve system. My husband brought my 4 years old girl down first and they managed to get into the pool. My 2 years old child and I arrived 10minutes later as she had to poo and change into her swimming suit etc. We were denied access to the pool and we had to queue up in our swim wear under the strong wind at the pool. My brother in law and his wife offered to exit the pool in exchange for us to go in. This request was also being rejected at first. My 2 years old girl was so excited to go in and i had a hard time trying to coax her to be patient. When we were finally allowed access to the pool, I was swimming with stress as there was a long queue of people in their swim wear. They looked so poor thing having to stand and queue for so long. We do not even know how long we had to queue or how many people were there already in the queue before we came down. This is such a silly system, inconsiderate of the wellbeing of customers. I sincerely hope that the management can review the system and make some improvements to create a better experience for all in future.","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0
29,3.0,"Check in & check out is a breeze. Stayed for 2 nights/3 days. Room is really small but if you're staying alone its acceptable. Room has a smell (not quite sure what it is, maybe a cigarette smell? but unlikely as hotel is a non smoking place). I was looking forward to a cable channel but was disappointed when I was told that at this time no cable channels (when I was really looking forward to watch all cable channels available)  Internet connection is rubbish , I had to call twice! (3rd time I was able to fix it myself) for someone to fix it as I cannot watch tv (otherwise local channels) as Youtube is directly connected on tv. Room service isn't that good too, I need to do a follow up call a few time as time had passed already and I still don't received my request. And another thing no iron inside the room you need to go to the 4th level to do it and your laundry as well (if you need it). Public transport is convenient too bus stop literally in front of the hotel and mrt is just a few minutes walk. Overall I would say its an ""Okay"" stay and I think I shouldnt expect much as the price is cheaper than other more rubbish hotels but I would say that they can do something to improve their service.","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0
30,1.0,"1500 rooms and 20 longchairs at the pool, you do the maths...""come to queue every hour"" told me the staff! Like if I wanted to spend my holiday queueing!! Covid-19 is the excuse the hotel uses to justify one of many lies: queueing at the pool (no booking possible), our family room looks like a dark closet, the noise on the balcony gives the feeling to be on a highway...

Upon arrival at the hotel, the check in was a breeze and the staff was so friendly. When I went up to my room, the room was clean but due to my friends medical condition, the room was not satisfactory. I went to the lobby and met staff Ryan. I explained to him the situation and without hesitation, he assisted to change our room before my friend could arrive. The room had an great view of the area around and even the Singapore Flyer. The next day, we spent some time at the pool which was exactly what we needed to relax. The staff was so friendly even when we asked for extra bottles of water and toiletries. Even at check out, the staff remained friendly and informative about future bookings and late check outs. The hotel even allowed us to keep our bags at the hotel even after we checked out as we wanted to go elsewhere for lunch and shopping. Definitely a staycay location. My friend and i will return.

Any last minute booking in Singapore would have cost a bomb but Hotel Boss was priced very reasonably.We were checked in by Hidayah who was friendly despite being swamped with a super long queue at check in. We got two rooms a triple and a superior double. very ample for a family or three children aged 13, 11 and 5. Hotel itself was clean. facilities like the swimming pool was as well. Safe distancing measures was up. Only downside was that the the double room reeked of cigarette smoke. We mentioned it to the housekeeping staff who immediately applied some chemicals to the air con. Smell improved. But still gave non smokers like us a headache. The hotel did have reminders placed for no smoking but some previous guests are less than thoughtful.We checked out early at 11 and had a family outing and reached home only at 10pm when I had realised that we had left our ipad at Hotel Boss. I called the hotel up and Ash answered, she assured us that she will get our rooms checked.

46,5.0,"I've stayed at Hotel Boss several times before and so far I have enjoyed my stays. This time around I've decided once more to try a 2 nights retreat to recharge and relax away from my rented place. This hotel is also memorable for me since it is one of my go to hotels  to book whenever I have loved ones visiting. Firstly, the price is right on the spot for a 4 star hotel which is not too expensive. I booked their promo for 2 nights which costs me only 188 SGD including tax. Secondly, I personally loved their lobby with the big grand chandelier but I missed the Gloria Jean's coffee right inside it. Their restaurant at the lobby is also closed. Check-in is quite fast as there is no line and my room is quite spacious. It has a comfortable Queen size bed, complimentary water/tea/coffee and toiletries provided. Slippers you could request if needed. The room is very clean, neat and tidy when I arrived. Since they have centralized air-conditioning the room's temperature is very pleasant. Complimentary WIFI is quite fast and easy to connect. Their TV only has local channels but I was about to see some Korean, Australian, Indonesian channels as well but since it's a Smart TV you could also watch via Youtube or browse the internet on it. The cream of the crop in my room is the view - with their huge window I have a full panoramic view of the CBD on my right and Singapore Stadium/Kallang river on my left.  It is indeed spectacular when I wake up in the morning I see the sunrise, then the sunset in the afternoon and finally the beautifully lit buildings of the CBD at night. The toilet is also wonderful, spacious, clean and I personally loved their flooring. It gets dry easily, not too slippery and looks clean all the time. The water pressure and temperature is also easy to adjust and control. They have a pool and gym on the 4th floor which is also huge and have a great 360 view of the CBD around it. The restaurant at the 4F is also open. Finally, their central location is the best! It is indeed just right outside Lavender MRT and just few mins away from Orchard, CBD and even the east - Jewel/Changi or the west central area around Sentosa/Vivo. And just outside the hotel is the beautiful Kallang river park and lots of restaurants,  convenience stores, shops and food stalls just beside the Lavender MRT station. It is truly memorable for me every time I book Hotel Boss, it brings back my memories when I'm with my loved ones before. I will surely go back whenever I need to relax and rejuvenate at this amazing and wonderful hotel!!!","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

We were not informed that the pool and gym were not available before and after booking, nor informed upon checking in.The purpose of opening up staycation package post COVID19 clearly is for patron to chill in the hotel and use the facilities. Else, are we suppose to just rot in the room? Have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area.

We said okay. However when we came back at 2pm, reminded that we booked for a city view, to have high floor, the staff Zin insist that there was no more high floor unit and gave us a 6th floor unit. We were disappointed when we went to the room, it was facing another HDB block and there was no privacy at all. We went straight down and asked nicely for a better unit, in which Andy was extremely quick in getting up to pace with the situation, and rectified it by giving us what we paid for in the very first place, a room with city view.

67,4.0,"What is it with hotels in Singapore having extremely cramped rooms? My room was a standard twin bed. There was no space to move after placing two large bags of my friend and mine. The room had a window which was as good as nothing. Anyways- my review will not be based on the room’s size as it’s a common trend in most of the hotels in Singapore. These kind of hotels are good to come back to only sleep, after having spent most of the day exploring the city.Room- apart from the description above the room had paper thin walls. You would be comfortable to use the bathroom only if you know your room-mate well! The bathroom was surprisingly spacious enough to do your morning duties and have a shower too. I chose this hotel over others as the shower area was separated by a glass wall. The room was basic but very clean. The staff did a good job of maintaining the rooms and hotel spaces- pleasantly surprised considering the massive number of rooms in every floor.The hotel was packed in the season we travelled in. But the check-in process was fairly quick. Staff was helpful. I would expect such a place to be chaotic with the number of guests checking in and out at the same time but it wasn’t the case.They have two restaurants serving breakfast- you need to select one at the time of booking based on your diet preferences. I managed to try both- the menu is limited but fresh. I would suggest to eat there solely to get you going in the morning. The swimming pool was spacious and clean, and so was the terrace area. The hotel is located 5mins away from the nearest metro station and is a quick 30 min ride from the airport.","Hotel Boss, Singapore",4.0

Hotel Boss gave us a clean, compact twin bed room with all the facilities one expects of a good business hotel, and at a very reasonable cost.  Its location is perfect for quick access to the metro or bus services and it is within walking distance of many places on the first-time visitor's list like Kampung Gelam and Little India.  Besides that, it is quite close to the airport so the cab transit is cheap.  If you choose (and I recommend this) not to eat breakfast at the hotel, there are dozens of options to fit every appetite and budget just outside and a few steps away.  The reception and housekeeping staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.  If I had the opportunity to visit this wonderful island again, I would choose Hotel Boss once more!

It was a real treat staying there, even though just for a night. We booked a staycation there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my spouse's birthday. We booked a slot for their sought-after high tea. The food spread was very delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The staff were very accommodating and kind. They made us feel very welcomed and also made our young child feel important! They spoke very kindly to him and engaged him in conversation.Our room was at the Mayfair Wing, overlooking the second (Balinese styled) pool. We had to book a slot for the main pool which was no trouble at all. Our room was clean and very comfortable. Housekeeping was also very prompt to send pillows to our room. The ones there were too soft for us so we had to request for extra. As we were celebrating a birthday, the staff was very lovely in offering to send us a cake, but I requested for a fruit platter instead which they sent!Breakfast was served a la carte style.

15,2.0,"I was looking forward to this staycation in this heritage 5* hotel, and booked a Junior Suite for myself, my husband and our son.  However, the experience didn't live up to the price and the expectations one has for a luxury hotel.The hotel suffers from a dated set of facilities, some extremely peculiar recent interior design decisions, patchy service and questionable cleanliness.  Whilst all of these things might be acceptable for a 3* or 4* establishment, they're not when you're paying the kind of prices Goodwood Park charges.Being in a lovely heritage building, you'd expect some old-world charm to the hotel, and the building exterior is very pretty. But, heritage of one thing. Dated and old-fashioned is another.  The Main Pool is very antiquated, and a bit forlorn looking.  A few sun loungers are scattered around in long, unkempt grass which surrounds the pool, flanked by tired and shabby paving. The child's pool at the end is particularly neglected, and the discoloured tiles make it look like the water is dirty.  The smaller Mayfair Pool is much prettier, and very pleasant. However, both pools lack facilities. There's no changing rooms in either, nor any toilets. To access a toilet, you either have to go all the way back to your room, or to walk through the restaurant or lobby to use the restaurant toilets. It's a very odd set-up and rather off-putting.  But the rooms are what is most baffling about this hotel. We booked a suite, and had high hopes, especially since the website states that they were all refurbished last year.  However, its clear this was done on a very tight budget. The living area is spartan and lacking.  Bizarrely, despite being a large room, there's no sofa, only a strange kind of low bench, and a very uncomfortable vinyl coated armchair.  There's no separation between the living area and the bedroom, which makes it unsuitable for families with an older child.The bathroom is frankly perplexing, and not up to the standard you expect for a 5* suite. It is large, and could have easily accommodated a bathtub and a walk-in shower.  Instead there's a pokey budget bath/shower combo with a cheap-looking sliding door, that you have to climb into to use.  Towels are stored on the wall behind the sliding door, so you have to climb into the bath to access them.  This is a space-saving solution that you see in small budget hotels, or in HDBs, and in those locations it makes sense.  But having a Travelodge-style bathroom in a 5* suite is very jarring.  Despite having plenty of space for a double vanity, which is standard in a master bathroom in a suite, there's one small sink that everyone has to share.  For some reason there's also floor to ceiling storage units on both sides of the tiny sink area, which are empty. These would be very helpful in our HDB at home, but are completely useless in a hotel room, where guests are normally staying for only a couple of nights.We would have overlooked these points if everything else was high quality, but even basic cleanliness was an issue.  The rooms were serviced, but there was poor standards on show, with dirty dishes left in the room after servicing. The corridors are strewn with rubbish and dirty dishes discarded from the hotel's guests, that sit in the corridors for hours, without being cleared.  Housekeeping is clearly not a high priority.In terms of F&B, there are three restaurants open during the evening. The Sichuan Min Jiang, specialises in shark fin, so if you care about conservation and sustainability, please steer clear. Another is the Coffee Lounge, a basic cafeteria that specialises in durian and has all the olfactory qualities you'd expect from that. The smell is very intense and permeates the whole area around the cafeteria, so you'd need to be a big fan of durian to brave that one.  The last one, Gordon Grill, has a limited menu which looks like something you would have found in a faux-French restaurant in a quaint English town in the 1970s.  We wouldn't worry about a lot of these things in a budget hotel, like an Ibis or a Travelodge, but if you're paying over $600 a night, we did expect better.  Overall the impression is of a hotel that is dated, tired and old-fashioned, not a a luxury heritage establishment.  I wouldn't stay here again.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

At the coffee lounge where we had breakfast, the service staff were also very helpful and friendly. They asked if we would like additional food such as bread and bacon.

The room are very spacious and clean. It was well equipped and fitted with beautiful artistic wall design as a backdrop.We were attended by a senior Madam (forgot to ask for her name) & Mohan at the Coffee Lounge. The former was very helpful and also very passionate in sharing the historical story of GWPH. Such a true gem for GWPH.The front desk staffs were equally helpful. Roman (DM), Geetha & Melanie makes our stay more enjoyable and meaningful...kudos to them.GWPH will definitely be one of our top choice staycay hotel and if we decide to make a comeback, we would like to see at least one of the F&B lounge is halal friendly....Verdict - Fabulous","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
19,3.0,"Some of the facilities (esp. machines in the gym) are old. The main pool is simple but the Mayfair pool is calming. Room space (Deluxe) is comfortable enough to fit 4 and it’s for money. I am however disappointed with the operator’s service. He seems to have a lack of knowledge on the hotel’s facilities. We called to ask if the hotel provides “bath salt” but he couldn’t understand us, hence we dropped it. Then we asked if we could get an additional soap but we were given shower gel (even though we repeated thrice we wanted bar soap and not shower gel). The most frustrating encounter was when the staff came to our room with the shower gel and claimed “we don’t have that (bar soap)”. So what is provided in the toilet? What do you call that? We had to physically show him the item for him to understand. Lastly, we had the hotel to help us store our tub of ice cream in their freezer. Initially the operator refused to assist us because they claimed that they can’t assist us to keep food due to COVID. Mind you, this is a new tub of unopened ice-cream and the hotel’s fridge isn’t cold enough for us to keep it there. After a tiny argument and the operator finally did her due diligence to check, she agreed to accede to our request. The ordeal was however to get our ice cream back. Operator just simply replied “oh you have to buy” when we said we want to retrieve back our PERSONAL ice cream. Another tiny note. There are no staff at the pool areas hence if you want towels, search for them yourselves. They’re not difficult to find but I thought we are paying customers. Service could be a whole lot better and because of that, I’m giving this hotel an average rating.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Prompt Buggy  Breakfast, in room dinning and room service are all tasty in big portion.  Complimentary birthday cake is an additional surprise.

The  main entrance that leads to the coffee lounge has been blocked due to Safe Measurement Management  and has walked go further up on the left hand side of the side of the building.The check-in had to go to through the safe measurement management and the hotel had emailed to inform on the allocated time to check-in. The process was very smooth without any queue.The allocated room was on the same level as the check in lobby. The room is spacious facing outward and the neighbourhood condominium. It was clean and tidy. The hotel has two swimming pools - one at the check-in lobby and the other is further in which is smaller. It has many restaurants to serve various guests - coffee lounge which serves the breakfast, L'Espresso which serves the afternoon tea, Gordon Grill which serves western meal, Min Jiang which serves Chinese meal and Tatsuya & Tatsuya on Japanese meals.Staff there has been with the hotel for many years and they are helpful.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

When going to the room (Parklane Suite), my family and I are a little disappointed. The place and room looks old and more like “chalet” Had to change to another room cos there is odour in the toilet Unable to remove the odour despite they tried washing it. Can see lizards crawling around the room too. During breakfast the staff at coffee lounge are nice and friendly especially Clinton Choo. He really goes the extra miles.

25,4.0,"I booked a 3-day staycation to celebrate Hubby’s birthday and our wedding anniversary. I wrote a comment under the Remarks section, not expecting it to be read ( as per my experience with many hotels and restaurants). I was very surprised when a staff showed up with a slice of cake, candle and matches shortly after we returned to our hotel room after our evening walk. Indeed my comments were read ! I also want to compliment the hotel on the homely feel that the staff (many whom are more elderly) gave. They carried out their work well while making me feel like I’m staying at an elderly relative’s house than hotel. E.g., while having set breakfast, the serving staff would come to check and ask if we were full / need any top-up. Even the younger serving staff doing the dinner shifts displayed the same warmth and good service. The hotel’s location is a plus too. Near to Orchard Road and yet not in the midst of it so there’s tranquility and is ideal for a good rest. ","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Imagine having tea with Singapore's late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - truly relevant and inspiring! This property and its people will fulfill all you need for a good stay and rest.I booked into one of their Mayfair Deluxe rooms and was given the furthest corner room on their highest floor (third floor). It is very spacious and with a balcony. All the amenities are included. It comes with a bath tub, but I am not sure if all the rooms at this wing are such. The housekeeping lady does a solid job.Enjoyed my stay. Highly recommended.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Part of this hotel retains their old staff which makes the service very warm for locals for their great service.The hotel rooms are a little old for some of the rooms since we prefer bath tub rooms for a staycation feel. Still the hotel managed to give a strong historic experience and a very colonial feel given the rich history.,"Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
28,1.0,My worst experience of all my staycations. Given it as 5* hotel but not the services... its really a bad experience for me. Not even a smile just standard script during check in. The DM when talking to me on the phone was more like a warden then the host. No empathy at all. Maybe they feels we are just local staycationers not worth the attention of a 5* star hotel staff.,"Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
29,5.0,Love the surrounding greenery and colonial low building. The structures are beautiful. From the time step in till check out was smooth.

The rooms are definitely clean and well maintain. Comfy sleep. A nice hotel that I would stay again for birthday retreat and layback staycation.,"Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
30,5.0,"First off, I would like to thank the following people for an amazing proposal:1. My fiancee2. Myself3. Me4. IOn a more serious note, pre-arrival, while most helpful, it seems like the hotel took every opportunity to make an extra buck. Thankfully, I was formerly a hotelier myself, and decided to DIY all the room decorations for my proposal to my then girlfriend (current fiancee). Quite understandable given the current pandemic situation. They were definitely very accommodating in my request for an early check-in as well as to view the room 2 days before my arrival. HOWEVER, I did observe a less hospitable Duty Manager at the front desk. Thankfully I do not recall his name, but he definitely seemed to enjoy avoiding welcoming any guests into the hotel, or generally greet anyone who walked by the front desk. This proved true on both on my day of arrival as well as departure. (Brief description: Wears specs, is about 175cm or taller, big built chinese man - Yes you know who you are, and I hope you improve your service, from one ex hotelier to another). Fast forward, the room package included in room dining dinner for 2, with the Chef ""preparing"" (mostly plating and reheating but nonetheless great service) in the room, and a room service staff to serve the meal. At this point I would like to highlight that my 5 star review is largely thanks to the 2 staff for the night:- Chef Leong- Room Service Executive(?) SureshNot only were they knowledgeable on the menu served, they were extremely attentive throughout the 1hour dinner. Added to that, while friendly and chatty, they maintained the highest standards of professionalism. What was surprising was Suresh had mentioned he would see us the next morning during breakfast. Overall the meal was delicious, and extremely well planned; Smoked Duck Salad -> Roast Beef Tenderloin w/ Mash Potatoes and Greens -> Mango Flan Cake with a scoop of Chocolate Ice Cream.The next morning when we went for breakfast, alas, this was another disheartening moment of truth: While I do understand the current shortage of manpower in service line, it is disappointing to see that we had to wait 25min before our order was taken (and it was taken wrongly), after which we waited an additional 20min before breakfast was served. I would assume during that time, a guest had lost a large amount of money or something extremely valuable, as all the service staff had their eyes glued to the floor/walls/anywhere but our table (sounds a little mean and I may get flamed for this, but I have managed to serve 100 guests with only 3 service staff including myself during rush hour at breakfast at a restaurant a long time ago; so bite me!) At this point, I had given up on enjoying breakfast; only to be pleasantly surprised by Suresh (who had served our dinner the previous night), and he gave us a basket of the bread rolls that we had enjoyed the night before. Before running off to cover his other duties, he swung by our table again to check if everything was okay, and if we were enjoying breakfast before taking his leave. I cannot emphasize how important such a service staff is to the hotel, in this current pandemic and most definitely post-pandemic; he is a true gem and will most definitely ensure that guests have a memorable stay with Goodwood Park. To end my lengthy (and naggy?) review, the 5 stars are most definitely for Suresh and Chef Leong! Hope more of such dedicated hoteliers can be groomed at Goodwood Park Hotel!","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
31,1.0,"I’d like to start off by saying that the lady receptionist at Goodwood Hotel actually asked me to leave this bad feedback on the staff service. This was pretty questionable in itself as all I wanted was to know my feedback would be passed on to the buggy driver in question, but her exact words were ""you can leave this feedback on tripadvisor so that he may see it"". So here goes.To be honest, they were all pretty polite and sweet from beginning to end so not shaming the entire staff in general, but the buggy driver/guy who handled our luggage completely ignored my presence and made me feel disregarded. Right off the bat, he asked for my partner’s name, how his day was going and only referred to him as he was showing us where the pools and facilities were in the buggy.""Sir what's your name?""""Sir how's your day?""""Sir this is the main pool...""I was right beside my partner the entire time and I was definitely not impolite/rude, but not once did he ever refer to me nor speak to me, nor welcomed me to this hotel stay. I’m not asking for royal service but it definitely did not feel nice to be completely disregarded and treated as invisible. Especially not when this hotel stay was a split cost between us two. This went on for two days and I tried to give him the benefit of doubt that perhaps since this hotel is pretty old/traditional, they have a policy to treat male guests with more respect, and that women are generally treated as invisible and not spoken to. I decided to pass on this quick feedback to the receptionist on how I felt and just to let her know it didn’t feel nice so perhaps they might want to ask him to revise the way he treated guests, and her reply was for me to leave the feedback on this platform so that he would see it. So here it is. I truly question Goodwood Park Hotel's company culture, as the values and service they expect out of their staff is outdated, unhelpful, and pretty self-sabotaging. Will most definitely not be staying here again.Nice room tho, I stayed at the Parkland Split Level Studio. However, if you are a woman and want a taste of what it's like to be treated in the 19th century then go ahead and make a booking.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

33,5.0,"Took the 3days 2 nights staycation package called Restless in Singapore to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Checkin was a breeze and bell caption was very friendly to take our baggage and show us to the room. Room was big and clean with new furnishings. Due to pandemic, only the front entrance is accessible therefore the down side is having to walk under the hot sun to orchard road. The degustation dinner at lobby lounge was a bit small in portion but quality was good. Dinner at the newly renovated Min Jiang was excellent and they surprised us with a small piece of cake for our anniversary. Breakfast was good and overall service staffs was very friendly. I am happy to note that quite a number of service staffs are mature aged and though they may not have high energy but they compensate with their warm and friendliness. They have fast Wi-Fi. Overall I highly recommend this hotel and will come back again. ","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Here, there is no direct pool service and attention could be improved (likewise for the larger pool); an order with the staff inside worked fine though.For dinner (as part of the package), a chef cooked in our suite together with a private concierge (great job @Suresh!!! Likewise thanks to the chef - we didn’t catch the name)! We had our own wine, which they served to excellent food.Breakfast is well presented by friendly staff. Location is just off Orchard Road.

37,3.0,"Goodwood Park Hotel is my 2nd staycation hotel since ""SG Clean Certified"" hotels during COVID-19. As with the first hotel staycation, the pandemic phase I/II  restrictions adds a negative damperner to an otherwise happy stay.However, I choose to review Goodwood Park Hotel at Scotts Road because it is a ""5-star Heritage"" hotel with one negative staff attitude.I had a room reservation for 1-night but at the reservation counter, I decided to add on an additional night.We had a ""Deluxe Poolside Room"" that had a small patio next to the Balinese-inspired Mayfair Pool.  The whole pool area is badly in need of re-vitalizing.  The pool area is in neglect... dead leaves, unkempt, old furniture, unraveling rattan wraps on the deck loungers, unappealing... etc, etc.I would mention that I would not be writing this review if not for the high-brow, ""what do you mean"" attitude of the check-out front desk male staff.  He asked how our stay was and I mentioned the pool condition.  If I were satirical, I could image ""how dare you"" thoughts going through his mind.With the lock-down period spanning so many months, the hotel should have taken the opportunity to spruce up the pool area in preparation of guests coming.Ok... the above was my grouse.  I do have some very positive feedbacks.1) Room service was very prompt... I called to say the backup toilet roll had soggy look (wet and dried out).  New rolls delivered very quickly but they correctly called me to say the staff was outside my room door but did not ring because I had the ""do not disturb"" on.2) we had dinner at the Ming Jiang (I think.. it was a tent-like dinning area?). The waitress was kind to tell us that the dish we ordered already had vegetable in it and not necessary to order a separate veg dish... she was right... more than enough.3) We order sandwich (forget name) and onion rings room service at 10pm.  Now this meal had exceptional presentation and thoughtfulness put into it. It came with pepper and salt shakers, a glass of chilled water with a lemon slice in it... absolutely love the presentation.4) the check-in reservation staff (female) was very polite.Overall, staycation during the pandemic... any hotel I think.... is a letdown... hotels cannot blossom like in pre-covid.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
38,3.0,"Was here for a staycation and was going to use the pool and chill. Had a good deal on the Parklane suites, but it was really far away from the main building. Had I known about the Hotel layout, and the Mayfair rooms and pool, I would have made other bookings. The Parklane suites are far away and because it was raining all weekend we had to walk in the rain via a back route that was really sketchy. We were told that a buggy could be asked to come get us to and from the building but it would have taken too long to call etc. The room is old and smells lived in, but it was clean and the kitchen appliances seemed new and easy to use. The washer/dryer had complementary bags of detergent. We joked that it felt like an air bnb overseas, so we could see how this would be a good deal for longer term stays. We had dinner at Gordon’s Grill and it was a lovely meal with very reasonably priced cuts of steaks that they came table side to cut for us. But the highlight was the table side crepe Suzette and the vanilla ice cream! We were able to capitalize on the location and went for a quick shopping trip to the malls around even though it was raining, it was easy to get around. Hotel room didn’t have umbrellas but we had brought our own. On the day of check out, the lobby smelt like paint and we were able to get a later check out time so it was great. On hindsight, I’d have booked the Mayfair rooms for the smaller pool access and they gyms are located there too. So I’ve included the map of the hotel grounds for insight for other travels.

41,5.0,"My wife and I really needed a place to rest and replenish and I can honestly say five nights here at Goodwood Park Hotel have been one of the most memorable and pleasant stays. All the hotel staff are highly professional and treated us with great warmth and kindness - from the time we entered the lobby, to our morning breakfasts and the impeccable high tea at the lounge. You can tell they really take pride in serving with excellence and pay much attention to the details - we were really impressed! It was no surprise that we found out many have served in the hotel for decades. The ambience of the hotel is perfect for a staycation - we thoroughly enjoyed both swimming pools. One is nice and big for laps and the other is a cosy Balinese style pool for quiet, relaxing times. We also loved how the historic charm of the building is nestled in lots of trees and greenery, right in the heart of the city. It is really peaceful and quiet within the hotel but you can walk conveniently outside to Orchard Road for shopping or food. Our Mayfair Deluxe room was very clean and well stocked with fruits and TWG teas. A super comfy bed and pillows helped us sleep super well and we really liked opening our balcony door to enjoy the breeze at night.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
42,5.0,"We just came back from a weekend staycation at the Goodwood Park Hotel.We were attracted by the good rate offered for locals and we were curious about the duplex and in-room dinning experience.So, eagerly we booked and I did not know what to anticipate because I did not know where the duplexes were located.We checked in on a Friday afternoon - slightly after 2 pm.  Prior to checking in, Ms Crystal Soh, the affable Assistant Reservations Manager, communicated with me thrice.  I made a mistake in the number of pax and she wanted to confirm the menu that we would like to have for the in-room experience as the Chef would need to prepare the ingredients.Our initial experience was less than satisfactory because the duplex was not what we had in mind.  It was more like apartment living and it does not have the hotel feel.  We wanted to change hotel so I contacted Ms Soh who referred me to Mr Roman.  Mr Roman understood where we were coming from and being a great host, showed  us another 2 duplexes before we confirmed the room we liked.He also allowed us to continue to have our in-room dinning experience.A Captain, a wait staff and a chef came into the duplex and promptly set up our table, and prepared our dinner.  We were awed by the experience.I would strongly recommend anyone and everyone who is reading this review to at least try this experience once.  How often does one get a chef to come right into your hotel room to cook for you?  We were told by the chatty wait staff that even the salad sauce was made by the chef herself.The experience was very nice indeed.We spent the remaining stay in a suite which were were upgraded to and we are thoroughly thrilled, happy and more than satisfied with the experience.  As one of us was celebrating our actual birthday, the hotel also prepared a cake for us.One more thing I would like to add - apart from being gazetted as a heritage site, the hotel has a mini museum showcasing artefacts from the Tang Dynasty.  The air-con in the hotel works miraculously well.  Our room was sufficiently cool and I could sleep through the night without waking up at 3 am in perspiration.  Hence, we know the hotel is well-maintained.Thank you, Goodwood Park Hotel for the memorable experience.Special shout out to Ms Crystal Soh and especially Mr Roman for the hospitality extended to us.   We are indeed satified.  Thank you!","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

It cannot be easy working in the service line during COVID-19 with all the extra requirements placed on hotel staff, but the Goodwood Park team still displayed the highest service standards.

Doorbells are REALLY LOUD. Very disruptive. Why can’t this all be done in one go?* Room noise-insulation is awful, can hear staff ring neighbours’ doorbells, neighbours’ TV & conversations and worst of all toilet noises. Can also hear every little noise from staff cleaning corridors. * No magnifying mirror in the bathroom. And water pressure is anaemic* Bedside light control panel doesn’t control two lights (desk lamp & floor lamp). Why have a panel, if it doesn’t control all lights?* Common staircase landing between ballrooms and bedrooms is too small and awkward esp coming back sweaty from the gym and squeezing past well-dressed wedding guests","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5
64,5.0,"Staying at Goodwin Park Hotel was the best experience for me. Every care was taken to make sure I was comfortable. I had  beautiful bright, modern room, overlooking the main swimming pool. It had everything I could want in it, including a comfortable bed and feather and down pillows. The house keeping was excellent. From the moment I checked in until I checked out, I was treated kindly and courteously. Unfortunately, I had to have an urgent operation while in Singapore and the staff at Goodwood Park were concerned and made contact with the hospital. When I returned to the hotel, I was treated with absolute care and compassion. The management and staff went well above what I could have expected to see that all my needs were met. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and would definitely stay there again. ","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

The hotel room was recently refurbished. The room was spacious, great storage space, desk and ample USB charging stations. A trip to the gym didn't disappoint. Gym equipment was perfect for the holiday guest. A good range of weights, water, towels but surprisingly headphones were available for guest use. The outlook was lovely too.A delicious breakfast was served in the elegant breakfast room. A spread of continental, American and Asian inspired food. The pastries were delicious. Food was quickly replenished. Staff were efficient and unobtrusive. Coffee and tea were brought to the table. In a month of staying in various hotels across Asia this was the first to bring coffee to the table. It is a small but welcomed treat. The hotel is perfectly positioned for Orchard St. Charming, elegant and perfectly understated luxury. ","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

Love the elegance and serenity of Goodwood Park where the hotel is located on the same stretch as the bustling malls while enjoying its uniqueness of quietness. We were being upgraded to a junior suite, room is cozy and comfortable. Good selection of tea and bathroom ammenities. The slight issue that we faced was that the tv in the bedroom was not facing the bed but facing the window. So, if you are laying on the bed, you would not be able to enjoy the tv programs (please see photo). Nonetheless, wasn't a major issue. Staff were friendly and good selection of local breakfast.

77,5.0,"When we choose a hotel we usually look for 5 to 6 things: 1. location  2. 4-5 stars and value for money 3. history or a strong connection to the past 4. a good sized room with a king bed 5. a great swimming pool, 6. good service. The Goodwood Park has all of these and more! We previously stayed at Raffles prior to its renovation and this time decided to head back to one of our all time favourites the Goodwood Park Hotel on our way back from Kuching. The Goodwood Park is located within walking distance of Orchard MRT, Tang Plaza; It's a colonial style hotel - or rather a mixture of Victorian and German architectural influences being the former Tuetonia Club for expat Germans in the mid 1850s.  It's famous tower block built in 1900 was added to the List of National Monuments in 1989.  We usually try and stay in a Deluxe King Room overlooking the Mayfair Pool (one of two pools) which has a look and feel of a tropical Balinese pool! This time our favourite room wasn't available and alternative rooms nearby were either booked out or guests occupying them decided to extend their stays. So one of the wonderful reservation managers, after seating us in the Highland Bar with a couple of free juices whilst a room became available, apologetically offered us an upgrade to one of the four Deluxe Mayfair pool suites! With direct ground floor access to our favourite pool, plenty of room to relax in the suite and excellent service for 3 nights we were in heaven! The only issue we had with the Suite was that we had to move the TV around a bit so we could watch it in bed - perhaps the TV cabinet needs to be relocated within the room? Even if you're not staying in a suite, the beds are some of the most comfortable you'll ever sleep in - especially if you like a firm but relaxing mattress for your bed. Just check in relax and wind down in that Mayfair pool and you'll never want to leave. Once you do just check out the local hawker markets - Newton Circus, La Pau Sat; do a bit of exploring in Little India, check out the Botanic Gardens, pretend to live the life of a China Rich Asian and soak up the culture, colours and life of Singapore!","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

The only hiccup that prevents this place from receiving an enthusiastic 5 out of 5 was one young front desk staff member.  We asked him to send someone to help with our aircon in the room and he smiled slyly and said he would send someone up immediately.  He never asked our room number and I walked back and said “don’t you need our room number?”  He smiled and said he had forgotten. Needless to say, no one was sent to assist us.  Other than this one issue, it was a very nice accomodation.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

It's nice to have coffee at the balcony in the morning.  I like their pool too.  They have 2 pools but mayfair is more quiet and relaxing in the back.

Had a couple of meals and they were very good and reasonably priced. Excellent and friendly service from all the staff.

Breakfast was fine - above average. What really coloured my experience was a brush with one of the waiting staff in the lobby lounge. Most tables were reserved (as for reason it is a favourite for tea with people) but we were sat at one that was not waiting for our cake order to arrive. We were so rudely moved out of it by a waiter who told us it, too, was reserved. When I pointed there was no sign, he said that a sign on an adjacent table applied to this table as well!!! Then we were moved into a hidden empty bar where service took an eternity because we were out of sight. Definitely would not go back.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

91,5.0,"My husband and I held our wedding at Goodwood Park Hotel on the 17th November 2019. It was a splendid and magnificent wedding celebration. All our guests whom attended our big day that day had nothing but praises for our wedding ceremony. I would like to highlight the excellent services being provided by Goodwood Park Hotel, especially the excellent teamwork led by Don and his team. Don has been a very helpful wedding coordinator to us since we decided to sign with the hotel a year ago. He was patient in explaining the terms and conditions to us and has offered tremendous help to us along the way. He has accommodated to all of our requests and even assist personally to help us in the decoration process. On our actual day, he was actually present throughout to ensure the smooth flow of the setups and we felt so happy to see him around to attend to everything personally. Despite the tight turnover time from the previous wedding lunch in the afternoon, the whole team did their very best to ensure the venue was ready in time. As my solemnisation will be held at 5pm which I believed the timing was quite tight from the last wedding, the team was still efficient in their setup and preparation work which we really appreciated their hard work and effort. We would also like to thank Hassan whom also played a big part in the excellent coordination work during the banquet. A big thank you to you and your fellow colleagues' help to ensure a smooth flow throughout the whole dinner. Prior to our wedding day, I checked in to the hotel a day earlier as I would be holding the morning part of my big day at the hotel itself, the front desk staffs were efficient in assisting with the check ins as well as seeing to the needs and requests from my bridal suite. They were polite, professional and approachable, it really makes my day and their positive attitude right from teh beginning set the tone of my mood right! Good Job!Besides the bridal suite, we have also booked a few other rooms for our friends and family members, the front desk staffs also did a great job assisting our family members and friends, accommodating to their requests as well as prompt in attending to their needs. Thank you once again.My wedding held in the Windsor Ballroom was beautiful. The setup, atmosphere, presentation, staff promptness, staff efficiencies and staff attitude, food was all of excellent grade! My husband and I were very satisfied with the overall presentation  of our whole wedding and I would said that it's a great success. And these are all due to the hard work and efforts each and everyone whom were involved in our wedding celebration. Credits to the well trained and professional Goodwoodpark team, Don and his team, Hassan and his team, Front desk team and everyone of the staff whom helped out with our wedding.Thank you once again for creating such a wonderful, memorable and beautiful memories for my husband and I, family members, relatives and friends. I would highly recommend Goodwood Park hotel, this beautiful heritage colonial style hotel to anyone whom would love to hold a memorable wedding ceremony, also to couples, solo travellers, family and group travellers out there, this is a hotel not to be missed when you come to Singapore or if you are a local longing for a short staycation or getaway.","Goodwood Park Hotel, Singapore",4.5

6,5.0,"Don't look further, Hotel G is the one of the best hotels to use your SRV vouchers!1. The most basic package is $100 - you don't need to fork out cash to top up. I.e. You can spend your cash on good food. 2. The rooms are small but the service is great. The rooms are small, about 15-17 sqm, but I don't feel suffocated. The same can't be said for bigger rooms I stayed in other hotels in SG and overseas. The rooms are nicely and uniquely designed, unlike many business hotels with generic rooms. The mattress they use is serta, so it's very nice to sleep on. Though the pillow can be a tad tough and flat. Also, the air con's temperature and wind speed are adjustable, hooray! Note: if you have a big luggage, it can be a bit squeezy. However, this is a mote point since we are all doing staycation now. The elderly-friendly / accessible room has a lower bed, wider walkway and a bigger bathroom with the bars and seat. Do choose this is you are bringing someone with mobility issue (I booked both good queen room and the accessible room, thus am able to notice the difference). The most important part of this staycation experience is the service by the staff. I had a lot of questions about the accessible/elderly-friendly room, and they patiently answered me (esp Yvonne). The front desk staff were also very warm and friendly the few times I saw them. They appeared alert and ready to serve. This service attitude was impressive. I had been to other hotels (even luxurious ones) these few months, but their service was not so pleasant.3. The location is great. It is at bugis, just next to fortune centre. It's easy to go to many attractions as they are just nearby. That said, there are some inconveniences:The lobby entrance can be hard to find for grab/taxi (it's a level 2 carpark). The wait for the lift can be long at peak hours (e.g. 8pm). Also, there's no lift to level 1. For those with elderly parents or mobility issues, you will have to take the manual elevator at Ginett.

22,5.0,"Tbh I don’t find the room too small as I’ve stayed in smaller. It’s OK for SG standards, where space is priced at a premium. The room is cleverly designed to maximize space while allowing you to feel cozy without feeling too claustrophobic. There’s space under the bed for luggage, and enough room for a small table for working travellers. Rooms feel quite well-maintained. Checkin and out was fast and efficient. And there’s so many food options in the area. Would stay at again!  ",Hotel G Singapore,4.0

40,3.0,"Will hotel G was quite an experience, first let's talk about the good things.A) Amazing location - the hotel is very close to the bencooleen MRT station, it's also connected by bugis and rochor, so it's super central to everything. B) everything is in the vicinity - you have a 24 hr thai restaurant under the hotel, you have the hotel's burger joint and a fancy restaurant called ginett under the hotel, there are about eight 7/11s and 2 fair price supermarkets close by. You have several vending machines and you can walk it down bencooleen for a late night drink... You also have Gokul which is an Indian restaurant across the street. C) you have bella as an attentive amazing and super help at the hotel... She leads the front office and she is the nicest person ever - always attentive goes out of her way to make sure u r comfortable... She helped us with loading 3 large bags in and out of our cab... Hotel G is lucky to have her in their team. Now let's talk about things which are not so nice...A) the hotel room is tiny... If you have claustrophobia skip this hotel for sure... B) there is no closet - which means you are accessing things from your bag all the time... Makes the room quite clumsy...C) the bed - it is attached to the wall which makes it very difficult to access especially if you want to go to the loo at night and you partner is fast asleep... You practically have to tap over her to cross... And if u r as fat as me... God bless your partnerD) Water is a major issue - let me tell u why, hotel g gives you these.littles cartons of water which you will finish in no time, now to refill it you can't use the tap because its a sprinkler l so its hard to fill it back in... So u have to keep ordering for these silly cartons which isn't very pleasantD) the bathroom has no division between the shower and the toilet so when u have a shower you have water in the entire bathroom, which is quite yucky...Overall if u have a short trip you can go for this property but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it for a long stay....",Hotel G Singapore,4.0

We were upgraded to the great room and the atmosphere in the room was beautiful! The celebration package Elvis offered comes with decorations and a $50 ginett voucher. (Ps. I moved away the celebration box because I placed my present there instead. I also collected the champagne included in the package afterwards). For the amount paid, I would say it is very worth it!

The plusses were that the front staff were courteous and professional during check in, the hotel itself was quiet with strong wifi for working, and the breakfast was very filling and delicious. However, not all the perks listed on the package were given, such as the morning and midday snacks. The fresh juices were nice, though.I encountered very mixed service at Ginett  restaurant where I tried to use the lunch and drink voucher given as part of the package. The front manager was polite and reminded me to check in with the TraceTogether App, and I had enjoyed the food. Yet... I had asked for the salad option, but was given the soup option first. I had to remind them that I wanted the salad option. I let this off thinking maybe due to busy service hours. But then bartender then completely forgot my drink voucher, and told me that my meal already ended when I gave my voucher to him at the start of my meal. When I reminded him of my voucher, I was given it back. After this experience, I was left feeling like I was not really wanted as a customer, and ended up not returning to use up my vouchers.",Hotel G Singapore,4.0

57,4.0,"Second time staying here, always very intrigued by the giant dream catcher in the room. However, the dream catcher in my room this time was a bit uglier and plainer than the first (the first had feathers). Room wise, it’s an affordable stay hence room size is small. It’s still manageable even though the bed is fitted tightly at the corner which means one of the guests would have a hard time going to the toilet in the middle of the night.Service wise, we had a warm welcome by manager Darryl, a much kinder greeting than our first stay. He allowed us early check in, likely since it was a Friday so there might have more available rooms. Late check out of 30 mins extra (12.30pm) was also given when request was made. Quite impressed as this hotel was willing to accommodate when they are able to.

A kettle with complimentary coffee/tea bags on a tiny desktop leaves no space to place your personal accessories like phones, jewellery, etc. Breakfast is the standard western fare or chicken congee, with a cup of cut fruits and croissants.

Understood that they try their level best to accommodate to their guests.Waited for about 1.5 hours to finally check in.

If you have neighbours beside u in the next room, u can practically hear their talking and laughing.Ceilings also has this creaking contracting sound at night. Could be due to the wood or tiles. If some1 is staying above u , u can practically hear the chair shift n their heavy steps.As much as we try to keep it simple & enjoy this staycation, we were rudely awoken at 12.30am till 1.30am by the next door neighbours grp of 4 giggling, laughing, incessant chatting till we couldn't take it and called concierge. Security guard found there were 4 ppl in the room instead of registered 2 person. Makes u wonder how lax security is. I went over to tell them off as the security does not seem to impose any authority. Disappointing to say the least.This was one of the worst hotel to stay in. Mind u, we were on the 9th flr. Every night we can hear what happens in the room besides us. And yes the walls are paper thin, even worse than some 40 year old hdb flat walls.We have stayed at hotel rei, moon hotel, yotel hotel etc, none had this sound insulation issue like hotel G.Wont be coming back here, i think the price charged might as well stay at hotel 81.",Hotel G Singapore,4.0

We thought that it was from the duvet and requested to change the cover. The cover was changed but the smell came back. It must be the duvet then. Informed reception and they advised that housekeeping would change the whole duvet and send us some water too.Water was sent to us but the other request was not passed to the housekeeping. Explained to the housekeeping staff and she brought us a new duvet. We must compliment the housekeeping staff as she was really courteous and nice throughout the entire ordeal.With the new duvet, we thought our worries were all resolved. Alas, a few minutes later, the smell was back. This time round, we decided to sniff for the source and finally found a spot in the mattress. It smelt like urine. Called up the reception. They apologised and told us that they would change the room. Called them again after 45 mins and the reception staff’s reply was “Oh my colleague hasnt called you? Let me check and call you back.” Then she called back and told us to go down to the reception to exchange the keys. Brought all the barang barang to level 2 , exchanged for the new keys before heading to the new room.Wrote this review on my first night stay in the new room. Yes the new mattress has no smell. ""But my pyjamas are already stained and so is my first experience with Hotel G.""Update:20 Dec 2020Woke up for breakfast and was greeted by the staff at the restaurant's entrance. Upon getting our room number, he checked in with us on the new room and whether everything is ok now. This is a very warm gesture.Breakfast was simple but good! Try the eggs special! Caramelised onion, bacon, chopped veg. Got back to the room and the bell rang shortly after. The front desk staff was outside and he sincerely apologised for the bad experience once again. At this moment we felt bad for leaving the bad review. There was really nothing to fault for the service. The hotel's service was really good. It's just an unlucky day for us due to a bad mattress.We accepted his offer to clean up our stained pyjamas. And here I am, updating this review on the second day of my stay with renewed confidence that this experience may not be that bad after all.",Hotel G Singapore,4.0

(Reminds me of the Papa Wale hotel in Taipei)For the price I paid, its value for money for Singapore standards. Nice and clean but its a tiny room. If you pay slightly more, you can opt for M Social on Klook and get a bigger room. Pros: Nice and clean but really no facilities in the hotel. Eateries near hotel and Bugis is a 5 min walk. The service staff was prompt in her emails, etc. Excellent service overall...Cons. The sink in the room is tiny, the pillows need to be thicker, the carpark entrance confusing.

11,3.0,"Klook had a 2N promo in selected Park Hotels and since GPO was just across my workplace, I decided to give it a try. Chose the Club Lounge room for a trial and was expecting a good experience, ambience and well maintained property since there were many hotels in Orchard to choose from. I had expected that maybe GPO would stand out from the rest...but it didnt. The room I had an unwelcoming & odd vibe, it too had an unpleasant odour that no hotel rooms should have. Was hesitant to request for a change in room for the booking I made was already at a discounted rate for 2N. I felt that maybe I got what I paid for.. Aside from the room odour, the aircon vents in both room & toilet was dirty and dusty. Couldn't help but think if that is the cause to the room odour? There too was a few strands of long hairs in the bath tub, smelly shower curtains & the tiled walls in the toilet had MANY stains. It was a major turn off while soaking in the tub. Personally, that shouldn't be the standard for a Club Lounge room for first impressions do lasts. ","Grand Park Orchard Hotel, Singapore",4.0
12,3.0,"Booked for a 3 day 2 night stay at the hotel. The staffs were polite & helpful & tried to accommodate our requests such as early check in & late check out. They had also upgraded us to the premium deluxe club access room. But we were quite disappointed with the room as one of the quilt had stains on it & the TV’s reception was not so clear. The afternoon tea was average, the coffee & tea was too bland. We enjoyed the evening cocktails as the selection of drinks were good, but the bar snacks were too little.

19,3.0,"The room is not soundproof. Next door gently close the door, you also can hear it. The hotel always close at 1 to 2 lifts (among 3 lifts) from level 1 dropoff point to level 4 lobby. If you are checking out at 12 noon, the hotel would only have 2 lift operating (close 1 lift), and there will be a queue. Despite the lift can only take in 5 pax due to safe distancing, there would always be more than 10 pax inside the lift squeezing with one another. During evening at around 8pm, there would only be 1 lift operating (2 lift closed). Again, there would be queue to the lift, to get from level 1 to level 4 lobby. From level 4 lobby, then you take another lift to your room. Called for room service, house keeping, reception in the afternoon at 2.30pm. All calls was not picked up by any staff, despite making multiple calls. Parking is not free for deluxe and premier rooms. Deluxe upgrade to premier is 20++. Usually premier king room would be full, and you are left with twin room. For full day parking, the price is $20 nett if you buy coupon from the front desk. For club deluxe and club premier, you would get only one parking coupon, for one time exit only. Parking rate is $3.80 per hour, and $1.80 for subsequent 30 minutes.

Premier room has transparent glass door, with separate standing shower. The room is 32m2 in size. Premier room also the same, just that they are located at a higher floor at level 10 and 11.When you drop-off at the lobby, there would be a staff to check your temperature, and you have to scan their QR code.

20,5.0,"We had a great stay at Grand Park Orchard! Would like to commend a few staff for their service that made our stay awesome & memorable. Prior to our stay we emailed the hotel with regards to certain matters & Faizal from Room Reservations was our liaison. He was very detailed and friendly & answered any doubts we had promptly. Upon arrival, we were checked-in by Ryan at reception, it was seamless and fast, he knew it was a special occasion for us an gave us a great room located on the 10th floor! Ryan was warm and polite, & went the extra mile for excellent customer service. I forgot my IC with reception as I was checking in and he personally delivered it to the room, and while doing so he checked my satisfaction of the room. Such attention to details and quality service are what made our stay all the more remarkable. As we checked into the room there was a knock on the door and to my surprise it was chocolates complimentary from the hotel. We had some bulky items delivered to the hotel & the bellboy/security at level 1 helped us using the trolley, after which Ryan took over and personally delivered the items to our room. His personal service to his guests is what makes him an employee that Grand Park Orchard ought to be proud of. At breakfast we were warmly welcomed by Fadzly, his genuine attitude and positive personality was definitely a great way to start our morning.

29,2.0,"Stayed at Grand Park Orchard from 28 Mar - 1 Apr 2021. When we checked in, the staff that checked us in was not aware of the fact that we had multiple bookings for 4 nights stay, indicating that the bookings were not updated in the system. We had to alert the staff about it. We had left messages on the Trip.com, notifying the travel agent that we had multiple check-in and check-out bookings. Having experienced working in the front office and reservation departments in other hotel brands, we are certain that Trip.com must have emailed the hotel to notify them of our message and special requests. Sadly, the staff was not aware of it. Nevertheless, we would like to commend her for reconfirming our preference (room near or away from elevator). On the hotel's website, it says that the it has been certified as a SG Clean Hotel but we found that the room was a bit dusty. Sure, we can close one eye on that matter. TV was old school. Some channels were missing because of signal problems. Found dirty cups in the room. Called the front desk and the housekeeping brought us paper cups and returned the cups after they have been washed. We also found that the shower head was ""faulty"" but still usable so we did not make a big fuss out of it. Wanted to request for a room change but was worried that the carpeted flooring in the new room might smell musty if we were to change rooms. We had that experience in another hotel so we decided to stay in the same room. The refrigerator was also dirty, especially in the upper compartment. Hence, we only used the lower half of the refrigerator. We did not plan to write a review on TripAdvisor but the service rendered was far below our expectations. We called the front desk on 31 Mar but we were not sure how to operate the phone so one of the staff called us on our personal number. We received a call from 6603 8888 at 10.37 pm on that day. We asked the staff to confirm our check out time on 1 Apr and the staff told us that the check out time is at 12pm. We were aware of the standard check out time, having read the hotel's policies. A few days prior to our check in day, we had booked our preferred check in time at 5-6pm. According to the website, it says, ""A later check-out time will be accorded for a later check-in (i.e. check-in at 4pm / check-out at 1pm; check-in at 5pm / check-out at 2pm and so on)"". As we had a Zoom meeting and was afraid that the meeting would end late, we booked for a late check in to get a later check out. We checked in after 5pm (nearing 6pm) on 28 Mar. To our dismay, the staff told us that later check out time could not be accorded as they were fully booked on that day. After informing her that we had intentionally booked for a later check in time to get later check out as per hotel's policy, the staff agreed to accord late check out till 3pm. We then requested for a later check out time at 3.30pm since the meeting will end at around 3pm. The staff agreed but replied to us in an apathetic tone. She sounded as if she was having doubts if we were telling the truth about the hotel's policy. We were shocked that the staff was not aware of this policy. Staff should be equipped with strong product knowledge. If the occupancy was really high on that day and late check out was really not an option, the staff could have offered us an alternative (somewhere conducive within the hotel premises). Going home was not an option because we had errands to run in Orchard after the meeting. We would have felt thankful for the late check out if the staff was sincere in trying to help us. We felt that this review is necessary because we were misled by the hotel's policy in booking check in time. What was the point of providing our ETA if that information was not used to plan room assignment efficiently? Side note - we saw that the system used by the hotel was Opera and we are familiar with it. Glad that we left the hotel using express check out so that we do not have to face the front desk staff again. We do not expect service recovery as we do not want to seen like we were taking opportunities to get the most out of our money. Would have given the hotel an average rating if not for the poor service.","Grand Park Orchard Hotel, Singapore",4.0

Book through Klook on 2 booking reference and emailed to the hotel to inform them of our request on connecting room. Our family consist of 5 person, 2 adults and 3 children aged 15,12 & 11. So need to have 2 rooms. I arrive early to use the business center to do my work while waiting for the check in time. Got my rooms at 12 noon, check out timing is also at 12 noon. When I got to the rooms and did a quick check, the housekeeping staff has already arrive to open the connection door. There were only 4 bath towels so I requested for 1 more towel, to my pleasant surprise, she came back with a set of bathrobe, bath towel , room slippers and a additional bottle of water. So nice of her. I went on their online app to book swimming pool slot for my kids.My family arrived at around 4pm, we went for a nice late lunch at takashimaya, returned to hotel to rest and went swimming from 6-7pm. The kids loved it. We walked along orchard road to Somerset to enjoy the rest of the evening. It's quite and experience for the kids. Room is clean and spacious. Good view as we face the main orchard road. Bathroom is our favourite, there's a bathtub, rain shower and a normal showerhead. Spacious too. Amenities are of good quality. Better than I expected. We booked room only, the cheapest grade but I think we got an upgrade to a better room. We had breakfast at prive paragon which is delicious! A very nice cafe to chill. Overall we had a great stay .

43,1.0,"Currently checked into the hotel. Arrived early but there was about a 30 minute queue, which is reasonable. Paid for a Club Deluxe Room.Now what's inexcusable is the absolutely filthy state of the room. Literally thick layers of dust and grime - not just in corners and under tables but on the TV console, the chair, and other high use areas. Couldn't even reach concierge to ask for cleaning - there literally wasn't any reply after 20min ringing.It's frankly horrendous. Avoid it at all cost. ","Grand Park Orchard Hotel, Singapore",4.0

61,1.0,"For a supposedly upscale hotel, there was a thick layer of dust (could write on it) on surfaces such as the TV console, kettle, and mini fridge that suggested that it had not been cleaned for several months, which was appalling given that these “high touch” surfaces should be sanitized frequently after every stay. Service was poor as well because I repeatedly called room service, concierge and operator, basically every available number, at 10pm to ask for a bucket of ice but nobody answered the calls. I gave up calling at 10.40pm and went to the front desk myself, only to be told that room service ceased at 10.30pm. Where were you from 10pm to 10.30pm?","Grand Park Orchard Hotel, Singapore",4.0

While I was rudely disturbed that there was no parking left for hotel guests,Ryan explained the situation patiently and offered alternative solutions that were very reasonable.

The television too that it does not make any sense of the eye level as the bed appears to be higher than the tv, it should be wall mounted with an eye level elevated plus to our disappointment that the Concierge counter does not have any auto operator mentioning that it is not in operation until we called the main hotline. It’s so unprofessional.

But customer service can be better as our room's TV was faulty and when I tried calling the front desk or concierge, nobody picks up the phone.

Kim served us sincerely at front desk so thank you for that! Paid a little extra for access to Executive Lounge and unfortunately it was closed. Felt like this could have been communicated before the stay to avoid the disappointment. Room was clean and spacious and bed was comfortable - had a great sleep! However, a bit unfortunate that their bathroom fittings are of low quality. Even the lounge chairs at level 4 are not well-maintained (stained etc). Other than that, all’s lovely and dandy!

No long snake queues, everyone was being served as quickly as possible. Immediate check in, no need to wait. Albeit they can be seen being short staffed, but they indeed worked hand in hand smoothly. We also got a complimentary room upgrade. I had requested a baby cot and Mr Azri I immediately get his housekeeper to send them to my room.

0,3.0,"On 17th April 2021, heavy rain occurs while travelling to Carlton hotel for staycation. Despite the heavy rain, our mood still filled with excitement and delightfulness because we are celebrating my wife's birthday. This booking was booked through Agoda around last quarter of 2020 (Premier Club Room with breakfast & Club Lounge Access) Upon checking in, we were shocked to be informed that the club lounge was no longer in operation since last year. A big birthday ""gift"" were caught us by surprise. I explained and showed the front desk staff that my booking via agoda includes all the perks which i paid for and yet  i didn't receive any call / email to inform me about this at all prior to my stay. The front desk staff simply just mentioned to me that your booking was made during last year. But I strongly believed that the hotel still have the courtesy and gesture /responsibility to inform the guest about the temporarily closure for the club lounge access when the booking was firm. At this point of time, the front desk staff keep emphasing that my booking was booked during last year and indirectly try to hint us that nothing he can do about it. A request was put across to speak to his immediate superior for further assistance. Front desk duty manager, Mr Colin Tan approached us and his initial response towards this issues simply just telling us this issues was created by agoda not ""them"" as the club lounge was closed since last year. Thus, Mr. Colin commented that i shouldn't scold his staff at the front desk. Of course, i admit that my tone of voice is firm but i didn't raise my voice throughout the whole conversation as this staycation was meant to be a memorable birthday celebration. After a long discussion, the front desk manager offered us an upgrade to executive suite and a dinner at Cafe Mosaic (Steamboat) as apologies from the hotel. Left with no choice, we can only accept and check in to our room. No doubt, the service recovery was made for this unforgettable incident but unfortunately, we have lost the  actual meaning of the celebration and I believed that if the front desk staff know how to handle the situation professionally( Customer Service) at the initial stage, things would have turned out better.

1,1.0,"Booked a 1-night stay at Carlton Hotel from Klook because they were offering extra perks like breakfast and late checkout till 4pm. However, be warned as the late checkout was not offered willingly. We had to asked for it and were only given a 2pm checkout  (which most hotels are offering anyway). The attitude of the front staff was condescending when we tried to ask for the 4pm checkout. We checked out out on Monday which is off peak. It felt like they listed the perk on Klook just to entice guests to book but wasn't willing to actually fulfil it. Breakfast was also one of the 'extras' in the package. But the quality and service was stripped bare and not meeting the mark of a 5-star hotel. The table was not properly disinfected after the guests before us left. There were only 4 options for breakfast - American, Congee, Nasi Lemak or  Vegetarian noodle soup. You are only allowed to have one order and the food was served more like canteen style. We asked for bread and the staff brought out a loaf of TOP ONE white bread that was still in its original packaging. There are plenty of brunch spots in the area so I would definitely not have chosen to pay an extra $80 to have breakfast for 2 of this quality if I had known this earlier.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

On Friday night it was very busy at cafe mosiac and staff seemed to be overwhelmed, to my surprise one of their staff seemed badly injured with his hand still in cast and he seemed to be having a hard time completing his job. I wanted to ask what his situation was and why is he still working but decided against it as they seem like they don't even have time for a drink of water. This is boderlining on staff abuse and I seriously hope the management will take a look at this. I'm also going to be reporting this to MOM.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

Was checked in by Jacqueline and she breezed thru my registration and even chatted with my kids. I can see other front desk staff smiling and accommodating to the guests despite the long queue!Was given a room on the 17th floor with a great view of the city. Room was very comfortable. I had no issues with the WIFI and aircon was good and strong. Kids loved the bathtub and this compensated when we did not get slots for the swimming pool.Breakfast was included in our room rate and we gave it a try the next day. Due to safety measures, no buffet breakfast here. Guest orders were taken, food were served and drinks were refilled. Guests did not need to leave the seats! All were well taken care of! Lyn served us for both days and she remembered our orders the next day. Kudos to her! Ryan also was helpful getting my kids refills (kids being kids).So a big THANK YOU to Carlton Hotel Bras Basah for making the March Holidays enjoyable! Especially to my kids!

Hotel is near to malls like Raffles city, Chimes, Capitol and Funan hence no lack of entertainment and food once venture out. breakfast set provided was great and filling. need to complement all Mosaic cafe servers on their warm services and friendliness on both morning we encountered, unlike the lukewarm check in staff. do not recommend mainly cos of unfriendly attitude of staff, housekeeping of room nt thoroughly, as well as not fulfilling the late check out and room upgrade proactively as per package purchased. For this Priceline and service rendered one can get better more enjoyable stay in other hotels in sg.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

11,4.0,"Checked-in a day before my birthday and spent the night here. Room is spacious and clean, bed is comfortable, bathroom is immaculate. Would be great if a bidet is installed.The lobby is very quiet as there is almost no guest. Checkin was fast and the staff is more professional than friendly. I had purchased a room with free upgrade, but it seems that premier rooms are not available so I settled for the executive room. My request for late checkout was granted, though.The hotel is within walking distance to several malls and museums, so there's lots to do in addition to amenities and dining options in the hotel due to covid restrictions. There are a few small things that can be improved -- missing hook on a drooping  curtain panel, one of two phones is unusable (key not programmed), busted night light under one of two side tables, incorrect billing total shown on tv hub. Other than these, I enjoyed staying in the room and having excellent service, including breakfast.It was an uneventful, quiet, and relaxing solo birthday celebration for me. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and will book this for my family when they are finally able to travel to Singapore again after the pandemic. I hope that the lobby would be bustling with tourists again soon and so that hotel staff can also regain their energy. Everyone seems a bit somber.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

20,5.0,"Stayed at Carlton in their deluxe room for 2 weeks and it was my first experience with the Carlton group. The hotel is very conveniently located in central Singapore, being just a less than 10min walk from City Hall MRT station. The room came fully furnished with a huge and comfortable bed and all the necessary toiletries such as soap, shampoo, etc. were all provided. The internet speed of the hotel was respectable and was definitely fast enough for me to have my business and meeting calls even from the hotel room. One can also stream YouTube videos will little or no difficulty (as long as you're not going all the way up to 4K resolution). My stay was comfortable and requests were all very quickly answered and acted upon by the staff. Really want to thank the staff for their professionalism and high standard of service rendered during my stay there, even for mundane requests such as more packets of coffee and green tea for those work nights of mine. Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to enjoy the gym and pool during this stay with the hotel, but will be sure to give them a shot during my next stay at the establishment. The hotel is also situated very close to Raffles Hotel and Raffles Place Shopping Centre for those who fancy a Singapore sling or some of the other food establishments around the area. Other attractions such as fountain of wealth in Suntec city and Marina Bay Sands are also a short walk or bus ride away. Overall, a great experience and huge kudos to the Carlton team.

23,1.0,"We booked a 2D1N for a total of three rooms. Check in was efficient and pleasant. Staff informed check out was at 4pm on the next day as indicated on the paper. As one of the room was not ready, we collected two keys and came back at 10pm for the last room. There was no special  instructions given when the last room key was collected. The next day (Mon) front desk called to one of the room (elderly folks) at 1 plus pm asking if they could check out early as they hv insufficient rooms. The elderly folks said that they could not as their children were out. No call was made to the children on the request despite that handphone number was indicated at check-in. At 3pm, we (the children) came back and found one of the room key card was deactivated. Left with no choice, one of us (P1) made our way down to seek an explanation. (P2) went to another room to wait. 10 mins later, a duty manager(DM) came knocking at other room asking if we are checking out. We told her yes we are in the midst, pls do not chase us. DM replied that she was not. So wondering why the DM came up then?? 5 mins later, P2 went to open the door to check if P1 is up. P2 saw one of the DM coming out from the room that was deactivated. On what circumstances, that a DM can open the room, despite that the 'Do not disturb' sign was on. P2 confronted the DM and she say she was verifying. She could not answer what she was verifying. P2 asked the DM to open the room door since we needed to pack and check out. A series of unpleasant bess occured. Very unethical and not professional to open the ro door without any valid reason and could not explain what were they verifying. Will not stay at this hotel again as DMs were not apologetic.

We requested and were allocated a room at the end of the corridor with a view out over Bras Basah complex. Room was very quiet: not much in the way of disturbances from neighbour noise or outside noise/traffic. 30sqm sized room was fine for this length of stay and is on the larger side of typical Singapore city hotel rooms. Comfortable king size bed. Large bathroom with separate shower and bath, rain shower. Very clean. 2 small bottles of water provided free. TV a little small but worked ok. Small pool on level 5 (didn't use). Efficient checkin and checkout (not too many people in October). Good location near the Raffles Hotel, Chijmes and Raffles City mall.

I waited for over an hour for check in and was rather concerned that there was inadequate social distancing of 1m to 2m being observed. When I received my room key finally at 3.30pm, my legs feel really sored. The hotel felt understaffed and when I brought my mum to the hotel floor we were given, we could see housekeeping staff and their trolley still hard at work. When we entered the floor, which should be non-smoking, I could smell some odour in the air and when we entered into our hotel room, we found the bathroom having a tint of cigarette smell although I thought there should be no smoking in air-conditioned rooms allowed.

For work there is uninterrupted high speed WIFI, a nice spacious desk and chair with a lovely City view, and as a bonus there is a view of the Cathedral for a reminder of the spiritual.

44,1.0,"It was a impromptu staycation plan for me and my wife on 28th March 2020 - 29th March 2020. Booked the room through Agoda 2 hours before checking in for the price of SGD244. I used my credit card for online payment. During checkin, the front desk staff, name Azhari, informed me that my booking was not yet reflected inside the system however he will help us with the checkin first. He informed us that the payment will be settled during checkout. First problem, even after showing him my booking at the front desk(maybe he just look without knowing my full booking), i was given a smaller room instead. We had to call in to inform that we were given the wrong room. Lucky we haven’t unpack yet.The next day, during checkout, i was charged a total of SGD233 for a night stay. Since their staff ask me for a payment card, i assume my Agoda booking went through their system but without my credit card being charged, i then proceed to pay using my debit card instead. 2 weeks later, i realised there is an additional payment of SGD244 still being charged to my credit card on top of SGD233 that has been charged to my debit card. I made a call to Agoda regarding this issue and after finding out the hotel has already charged me, they refunded the SGD244 back to my credit card account. And i thought the issue has been resolved. But thats not the end of the story. The following week, while checking my bank account balance, i realised that i received back the SGD233 from the hotel. Made a call to the hotel and they say that since i use Agoda to book the room, i should pay Agoda instead. Why am i only informed when i called? If i didnt call, it means i will never know? They should have informed me when i checked out. Not to refund me silently. Wondering whats the motive behind this. To cover up their mistake? As i had already received a cancellation of my booking from Agoda, i made a call to them again informing them what happened. I was then “re-charged” for the same booking. But because of the increase in exchage rate, my booking became more expensive. Instead of the initial SGD244, now i have to pay SGD254. The hotel could have just double confirm with me 1st before charging me twice, and then refund me back(without me knowing) and asking me to settle with Agoda with no sense of guilt. My mistake is that i did not read the previous review regarding this hotel. After I reread the previous review, all i can say is, BECAREFUL WHEN YOU MAKE PAYMENT WITH THIS HOTEL. ALWAYS DOUBLE CONFIRM WITH THEIR FRONT DESK STAFF ABOUT YOUR PAYMENT. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BANK BALANCE AFTER YOUR STAY.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

48,4.0,"Visited during a quiet period due to the virus impact on tourism and it makes it difficult to assess what this property would be like during normal operations. Everything was smooth and efficient but almost inevitable for such a large hotel it lacks any real character and is best treated as just a place to rest ones head overnight.  The room, basic “deluxe” was perfectly adequate and met the key requirements for a city centre hotel in that it was well soundproofed with a comfy bed, excellent shower and good blackout curtains.The pool is unusual in having a good deep end and is better for swimming than as a general lounging around area.  That said I was very disappointed that on a Sunday afternoon the pool bar was unstaffed for more than an hour with plenty of potential customers looking for refreshment who were met with a sign that said the bartender had popped away “for a moment”.

One of our cases was a little damaged but still alright to use. We left to walk around the city and do last minute shopping. We decided to buy a replacement suitcase for our sickly one and we would ask the hotel to dispose of the old. However, we were very lucky we had decided to do this as on our return we found that our suitcase was now totally broken and not fit to travel with!!

I first submitted my cancellation request to Carlton on Jan 27, 2020; it had taken at least 3 followup email to get a negative response from the Hotel.  After 3 and a half weeks of waiting, they told me they would not accept cancellation, but would only allow me a One Time scheduling change.  To which I think this offer is insensitive and ridiculous,  at this time of travel difficulties with the virus happening in many worldwide cities, how can one decide when is a safe time to travel again ?In Summary,  when we do decide to pick up our bags for our next trip to Singapore, rest assure I will not pay patronage to this hotel.  I do not condole their business culture.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

There was a bit of confusion when we arrived as their computer system was down so hhad to find our reservation numbers on our devices & email it to the hotel. Not a real drama & very apologetic. There was extra paper work to complete with the Coronavirus about but you would have had to do that at any hotel now. We were given the 2 rooms on level 24 with loverly views. The rooms were large but the bathroom configuration was a bit different might have been difficult for a couple of friends travelling together but fine for us. The TV went on the blink so I reported it, will send someone up ASAP. Not less than 10 minutes someone one arrived & all was fixed.

It was modern and comfortable with plenty of room for everything we needed for a three night stay. The breakfasts were good with plenty of choice, but sometimes could be hotter. The in-house bar, Joji Bar, provided a relaxing place to have a drink in the evenings with lovely staff. On one occasion it was raining and we were offered free umbrellas by the concierge who could never do enough for us. On our last day, our flights were not until 23:15, but we were told we could store our bags in the hotel and on our return from more sight seeing, could have a shower and change our clothes before boarding a taxi to the airport.I cannot fault the staff or the hotel and would recommend this hotel anytime.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

I am not sure I will be traveling to Asia and or Southeast Asia just yet as there are so many bans on traveling there.  The Carlton hotel manager is insensitive and only cares about their bottom line. This hotel has definitely lost a customer in me. More importantly, my family and friends will not go there either.

Check in was smooth and quick. The room category I had was a very basic one with walk in washroom. The wash basin in the room had cracks on it and could be fixed from an aesthetics point of view. The hotel doesn't provide loofah and amenities are of low quality, so i would advise you get your own. It get very noisy in the night since my room was next to the road(6th floor).

The only complaint we had was that when it rained during the night, a dripping type noise could be heard rather loud coming from outside our window.  Any other time we would have phoned reception to ask for a different room but it wasn’t discovered until it was about 2am and we were all unpacked and desperately wanting some sleep so we persevered and got used to it.Other than that we were very happy with our stay and would book again.

We booked for three adults, the addition of a third bed made access to the desk and easy chair impossible. The club lounge provided a good choice for breakfast, the inclusion of canapaes and evening drinks was worthwhile especially considering the cost of alcohol in Singapore, be warned the drinks were very strong!

Straight across the road is Raffles, Raffles City and Chymes.  The ever popular quays and the MRT are only short walks away.  Rooms are perhaps a little on the compact side but that goes with the territory.

80,3.0,"We have been staying here once or twice a year for the last few years. Our latest visit was rather disappointing. We always stay on the Club floor and the rooms here are good, housekeeping is good and the location is excellent. Where we found standards had declined was in the Club lounge. Staff on this visit, which was for a week, were less interested and attentive than previously and the quality of food presented at breakfast and in the evenings was very average, boring and repetitious. All offerings were centred around chicken and noodles with the other dishes coming round every three days or so. It would be cheaper and better to go to Buffet King in Raffles City than use the lounge. Choice of wine is now restricted to one red and one white wine of little quality. It would seem that a drive to reduce costs has resulted in poorer quality of product. Regrettably we will be looking to stay elsewhere on our next visit to Singapore.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0
81,4.0,"Came here for business event and stayed for 2 nights at their Premier room. The room was very clean and spacious. Check-in process was very quick and efficient. Breakfast at The Mosaic restaurant was good and always busy. The buffet options were not many but enough. They need to offer more desserts as they’re only 4 types of delicacies for during lunch. I felt like they’re lack of connection to guests as mostly all the staff were not really warm and hospitable - which is probably due to the culture of the country. There is only one staff named Bapak Yunus; he was part of front office staff but super duper friendly and he really represents how a hotelier should be.

83,4.0,"It wasn't my choice to stay at this hotel as we are Fairmont and Marriott loyalists, but nevertheless, my brother-in-law picked a decent hotel.  We were there with a 2 babies, 3 toddlers, a senior citizen and 7 adults for a long-belated extended family vacation.The hotel correctly markets itself as a 4-star property.  I found guest service to be either great or disheartening.  The facilities are more than adequate, with an impressive main lobby and modern, comfortable rooms. However, the facilities can also be questionable, depending on your personal definition of hygiene and the housekeeper you are speaking to. These are things that are normally a non-issue with 5 star properties.  They also market themselves well to the business crowd, although surprisingly, they had a lot of big families staying with them at the time we were there.Facilities - Rooms were comfortable, at least in our Executive room. The housekeeper looked genuinely nice and made our room of 2 kids and 2 adults inhabitable. The only thing I noticed was you have to specify with daily room make up if you want them to vacuum the room as well.  I watched a banana bread crumb sit in the same corner where my 4-year old dropped it for 3 days until I could no longer handle it. I forked over a ""Merry Christmas"" tip to the housekeeper, who promptly resolve all other issues for the rest of our 8-day stay.  Elevators functioned as it should and bathrooms functioned as they should. I have no complaints on the water pressure. They also had a lovely, giant gingerbread house in the main lobby for their Christmas display and the kids had a great time playing around it and taking holiday photos.People - This is a huge hit or miss. I don't know if it's just me, but do you find it's the front desk people that tend to have attitude? Just in general I mean. Shout out to the ummah (grandma) and all the breakfast servers at Café Mosaic who went above and beyond to assist us with our very cranky baby boy who was suffering a stomach bug the one day we had buffet breakfast there. I got great advice from the ummah on what to feed him to help him recover and all the other servers were super attentive.  On Christmas Day (also my husband's birthday), we encountered a server with an attitude, which was promptly resolved by management. Another encounter I had on Christmas Day was asking two chefs if they could grill some of the cold seafood and the initial response I received was a no.  A man came out who appeared to be a more senior chef, and indulged me in cooking up some of the seafood but apologized saying it was a very high volume night for them and therefore he could not do my request a second time around. I greatly appreciated his response. I was simply surprised because any hotel buffet in Manila charging a $100 would not say no to this kind of request. But no matter, I was satisfied and appreciative of that chef.We also had dinner twice at Wah Lok. No complaints with the food and the staff was very 5-star. Definitely the crowning dining outlet of this hotel. Christmas dinner was nice with a Santa and some carolers making an appearance.Their front desk? Check in was slow, tedious and clinical. People lined up like cattle trying to check in and as much as they tried to be organized with suitcases, they were everywhere in that lobby.  I had the misfortune of asking (just one time) this concierge guy (standing right behind the counter with the word ""CONCIERGE"" on it), if I was able to shop online and have it sent to the hotel. I explained we ran out of a baby product but found it was sold in Singapore online.  He must have misheard me and abruptly told me they do not buy things for hotel guests and I must buy it myself, but the front desk would be able to receive the item for me.   I asked where we could purchase this item in Singapore and the answer was ""I don't know"" and a blank look.  Compared to the experience we had at the Fairmont Mayakoba (see my review where this 5-star hotel has a real concierge team), this just turned me off even ordering online so I didn't bother. Finally, if you are traveling with an infant and need a bottle sterilizer, they have it. After almost 2.5 hours of waiting for it in the wee hours of morning (long story), a brilliant housekeeping associate, with the help of room service and someone from the front desk, probably dugged it up from one of their backrooms. There was a huge language barrier to explaining what a bottle sterilizer is for (despite ""baby bottles"" being name dropped every sentence) and that's why it took so long.  But no matter, we ended up getting the bottle sterilizer around 215AM. They just don't have microwaves (we had a microwave sterilizer in tow) to lend you. Their location is probably the best part. Being able to just cross the street to the Raffles mall was excellent, especially when you're traveling with small children.Overall, it was a pleasant stay. Given the choice though, I would pay a bit more to stay at my usual loyalty programs.",Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

87,4.0,We stayed here for 3 nights over new year. First off check in was quite slow and we had requested 2 rooms next door to each other or at least on the same floor but ended up with one on level 11 and one on level 17 ok we understand it’s a request only and lived with it. The rooms themselves are quite large and clean although I did have a tear on the bottom sheet that I noticed as soon as I pulled the covers off the first night...not sure how someone doesn’t notice this when making the bed? Breakfast plentiful but busy and as previously stated my husband heard a senior staff member speaking in an aggressive manner to other staff members in full view of customers not the thing that should be done and needs to be dealt with by management ASAP. One thing that was not conductive to a relaxing mood was the lobby. It felt like an airport terminal with queues of people waiting to check in and people sleeping on couches for hours on end and huge amounts of luggage lined up constantly. This was not only one day but continued throughout our stay. The location of the hotel is fantastic and only a 5 minute walk to city hall MRT. Also Raffles shopping centre across the road with money exchange in the basement and supermarket as well as a food court on level 3. Easy to get around to all the sights by MRT or walking. ,Carlton Hotel Singapore,4.0

Went back down to front desk to inform them who profusely apologize for it and rectify by given us another room and at the same time upgrade us. Went out to dinner and came back to the room with a letter as well as phone message from duty manager asking to call him back. Called him back and again he apologize for the mistake and explain it was due to a system glitch and offered us free breakfast for our entire stay. I would like to commend their response and professionalism in handling this issue. They deserve a 4 star rating for this. The reason why I have a 3 star average rating was not because of the above. Two days in a row at the restaurant having breakfast, I encountered and overheard the staff lack of respect for each other and the fact that it was loud and could be heard by every guests. The 1st morning , there seems to be a quarrel between staffs and one walk out- this happen in the middle of the restaurant and after which you could hear staff chattering among themselves. Second morning , I experienced a probably more senior staff talking to another staff in an appropriate and aggressive manner in front of guests.  I felt really upset with the treatment of the junior staff member. On hindsight, I should have said something at that very point of time. I feel that the staff at the restaurant needs more training in terms of respect towards each other and also not to handle issues in front of guests. For this very reason I award a 3 star ratings.

It is an additional cost but there are several benefits which I thoughtworthwhile.The Premier Club lounge has a great view and offers a much more relaxed breakfast option and the evening happy hour includes drinks and snacks. Alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore so if you like a glass or two of wine in the evening, this is great. The staff in the lounge were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and while we were hopeful, we didnt expect to be in our room until later in the day. So we were surprised and grateful when we were first encouraged to have breakfast in the Premier Lounge while we waited for our room and then, while at breakfast, were told our room was now available. Having flown for what felt like a year, you can imagine how nice it was not to have to wander round the city all tired and ""aeroplaney"".Our connecting flight a couple of days later left at 1am and we were also offered the option of staying in the Premier Club Lounge until 9pm.

The room is clean and comfort with great service by their housekeeping team. The only suggestion to improve the APP for safe entry and input the daily repetition questions though you are registered guest.",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

It has an amazing bath in the Splash Room, which was a highlight. the swimming area is on teh basic side, but it is modern and good for exercise. there's no F&B at all, But they allow deliveries from Grab or Deliveroo.",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0
3,5.0,"Its the school holiday and also the birthday month of my firstborn so we spent 2nights in a splash room. Glad we booked early cos was told that the splash room was a fav. Now i know whyyy and id come back for it again. Dorsett is located right smack in Chinatown. An area id never thought of staying for i thought it was jus out of the way from town but my stay there changed everything. Outram NEL is jus right below n it links with Outram EWL. Jus one stop away to Harbour front/vivo and walking distance to chinatown point and keong saik. Cafes, restaurants, Bars are all walking distance and its just so convenient. Now i see why Dorsett is a hotspot for tourists. I too dont quite like the idea of a staycay and having to travel soo far for food or drinks cos i like to spend more time in the comfort of the already cosy room so this, is perfect! Shoutout to two Dorsett’s gem for my Booking was made easy by Ms Naurah who handles my queries online and offline swiftly while my checking in process was smooth thanks to Ms Kacey.Thank u to everyone too for making my son’s bday staycay a memorable one too! For the situation the world now is facing, i feel safe here on this new norm for their process of screening incoming guests. So i assure u that no guests will be able to enter the hotel without declaring their health and travel info. My stay at Dorsett are made even better with such clean and cosy rooms that made me miss my nights there while typing these. Well equipped with toiletries, coffee, tea and bottled water. I like the idea of having the access to the wardrobe from the bathroom itself. I mentioned we booked the splash room so we got the bathtub and a separate shower. Loved how we cud roll up the blind so that i cud sit on the bed even when my kid is playing in the tub unlike one hotel i hav to squeeze in the alrdy small bathroom with him. Not here .. the bathroom is spacious! The king bed fits us nicely. Em Fluffy pillows n warm quilt. With that, i still hav a lil corner for the kiddo to play his toys. Not big but its really cosy. There’s one thing though .. one thing that made my kiddo whines. I was spending a little too long in the shower. I cant help it.  The rain shower pressure was soo good i swear tt was the best shower i had in hotels. Ya know .. usually the water pressure in hotels are a lil slow but this one was really good together with their refreshing mint scent of body shower and shampoo. That must be why i had a gd sleep aft too. I still hav soo many things to write about but i have pictures that can help me do the deeds instead. Tips: Lookout for their promo on their website and book early to avoid disappointment cos really, the splash room was hot! Lastly, be nice be kind and be responsible Enjoy the pics and stay safe guys! ",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0
4,5.0,"My wife and I had a good staycation for couple of days recently at Dorsett Hotel Singapore located at New Bridge Road. Wonderful location connected by MRT lines and SBS buses. It’s all a matter of 5 to10 mins walk from the hotel to the transport links to go to any part of Singapore.The other big plus of the hotel is its location which is right smack in the middle of Chinatown. You have access to all the eateries like Food courts  located in Maxwell Hong Lim and not forgetting Chinatown Point. The hidden food treasures in Keong Saik Road, Bukit Pasoh,Smith street, mosque street and pagoda street are countless, if you need to fulfil your gastronomic needs.The Dorsett hotel entrance and lobby is swanky and lovely it was quiet though but well served with good reception by front desk. They take the Covid measures professionally and with a polite and smiling  approach. They are helpful and at the same thoughtful. Dennis who doubles as their manager and who deals with hotel guests was a great help in getting our reservations done even though we had to change our dates. He took the trouble to show us the lovely rooms and the amenities available in the hotel like the swimming pool and gym. He even made arrangements to get a cake for my wife’s birthday, it was indeed a special touch. On our date of arrival he received us and assisted in bringing our bags from our car. With regards to the room it’s a lovely property spacious enough for two and well laid out wardrobes and well demarcated shower and toilet area. The housekeeping staff did a great job during our stay and they were always on hand to tend to our needs. I must say the room that we we stayed was super clean and their linen were of good quality.My wife and I will certainly return to Dorsett hotel for our next staycation.",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0
5,4.0,"Location:Right above the Outram Park mrt station. With a sort of dedicated route to the hotel via an elevator from right inside the station.  Very convenient.Hotel room:Size is not that spacious but still okay at 22m2 as per its website for the basic room. Our booked King bed was actually 2 singles merged into one. Minus a point for not informing us at the reception. Overall room is clean. Bathroom/toilet is very small. First time I ever got ""damaged"" twice while in the toilet during my shower. First my right hand swung onto the bath soap tray during shower and while drying myself outside the shower my back knocked against the metal sharp end of the shower door handle. Fortunately it was not that hard that would cause a deep painful bruise. Lastly the toilet door was not working as well.Staff:I have no issues with anyone. Everyone was very efficient and helpful. Due to the SG Clean status of this hotel, the various procedures to ensure everyone's safety from the pandemic were not that inconvenient at all. Sound out to the front office staffs from Rachel who checked us in as well as the entrance lady who'd explained clearly what we needed to do to enter the hotel premises daily. Facilities:The swimming pool was quite nice. We were only allowed an hour daily and the added step to appear at the front desk just to collect the card pass was slightly inconvenient. Would it not be more useful to allow this set hour to be programmed into our hotel room cards instead of needing to go physically collect it at the reception when using the pool? Another minus half point.Summary:We would come back if we need to go Chinatown again and when the price is as good as what we got. ",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0
6,1.0,"Stayed here recently for 2 nights, booked this hotel because it has a great 5 ️ review.. upon arrival on 2nd Jan, hot/warm water wasn’t available(decided to gv it a slide). Woke up next day(OUR WEDDING DAY) still no hot water to shower... gave them a call to check whats up? Staff said the lower floors were affected due to the weather  and technicians are trying to rectify the problem... okay.. went out and came back to the hotel at 10.30pm!!!! STILL NO HOT WATER TO BATHE!?!? Requested to move us to a higher floor where the “high floors” weren’t affected much..my husband and I were put through multiple calls with the staff back and forth until 1:30am just to move us to a higher floor but they refused to... all they could offer is just a later checkout time for more rest... and all this happened on our wedding day and even the day before!!! Imagine the exhaustion we were put through coming back to the hotel and we just want to bathe and sleep during covid period! We paid the hotel with our own money without SRV too... this treatment we got... NEVER AGAIN WILL RETURN HERE! * also.. who the hell are you in rights of budging in to check if our water isn’t hot? Your staff purposely came to check if our hot water wasn’t working and what an invade of privacy and think that we are lying! Your staff who changed our kettle also came in without permission to remove our kettle! ",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0
7,5.0,"Last Christmas 2020, I've decided to book a 4 days 3 night staycation at Dorsett hotel to relax, enjoy and have some me time. I went to their site directly to enjoy some great offers like 12% off and free upgrade to next room category. I booked a Dorsett room and upon check-in my wishes were granted. They upgraded me to Deluxe and  a late check out. The other offer if you book direct on their site is the complimentary limited edition Dorsett Eco straw. The check-in process is very well organized and managed adhering to safe distancing measures properly. In addition, health screening is enforced before you enter the hotel lobby. The lobby is grand, with their lovely huge Crystal Chandelier, Grand Piano and the decor is quite exquisite. I loved the black tone of the interior decor. After check-in there is a staff assisting you in opening the elevator which I am very impressed. At the same time they have this Grand Elevator lighting of Red, Yellow and Orange which adds more grandeur to their lovely interior decor. My room is on the 3rd floor which is also adjacent to the Pool and Gym. And upon my check-in I already booked my 1 hour pool slot daily which is required to adhere in safe distancing measures. I must say the doors of their hotel have this unique cameras attached on the wall beside it in different colors. And they light up Red or Green whenever you opt not to be disturbed or make up the room. My room is so huge that I have so much space for a solo guest like me. Upon you enter you have the control for the aircon which you could turn off and not fully centralized  - a plus for me. Then to my left is the safety box and a huge cabinet. The hotel provides laundry bag, slippers, iron and robes which are another plus for me. Straight towards  to my right is the huge flat screen TV, mini bar and the desk is quite big and spacious as well - I could fit my food, drinks, laptop, phone, and books all at the same time. They provide complimentary water but a bit small for me although they can provide you for free if you ask for more. Then the window with its  black out curtains is so wide and big I could see almost a panoramic view of my surroundings outside. To my left is the centerpiece of this room - a grand King Bed which literally can fit 3 people. The linen, pillows and blanket were very comfortable except I could see a bit of stain on my blanket but I could live with it. On the left side of the bed hangs a big lamp. There are 2 bedside tables with power outlets and light controls for the room, which made it easier and comfortable for me. The cable TV provides lots of channels and the WIFI is so fast. For me, this is the fastest WIFI I've experienced even better than other luxury 5 stars. A big big plus!!! Then to the right of the King bed is the Toilet and Shower. Oh my, it is a room in itself. First, they provide generous amount toiletries including a nice hand lotion. Second, the cabinet is connected to the toilet so I can reach out to my clothes and things from outside. Third, the rainfall shower and Gold/Black tile combination on it were quite elegant. It feels like a spa - very relaxing and soothing. I personally loved their Elemis Shower Gel and Shampoo which has a great calming minty aroma. So overall, I really enjoyed and loved my stay at their Deluxe room. I also tried their pool during my stay and it is a lap pool with attached Jacuzzi. The pool is clean and is surrounded by trees on right side covering the rooms attached to the pool. The left side has the pool beds and a view of the surrounding buildings and roads outside. Shower is near the entrance to the pool. There is also a gym beside the pool.  Pool is great except the water is cold. I also tried opening the Jacuzzi but it's not powering on.  But regardless, I was able to relax and swim some laps. The staff are very courteous, friendly and accommodating. Hotel is directly above Outram MRT station and very near Vivo mall in Harbourfront station and around 10 mins walk to Chinatown. There are restaurants and cafe nearby but the nearest convenience store is a bit of walk so better buy your food, drinks and snacks before you go back to your rooms. Hotel doesn't have room service nor restaurant as well.  Same like my check-in process my checkout is also smooth, fast and convenient. To conclude my excellent review, I am very glad that I've spent my Christmas at Dorsett, which feels like home and will definitely come back again :=)",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

Would like to thank all the staff from reservation, reception to housekeeping for the great effort to decorate the room which was a surprised for us.

9,4.0,"My experience with Dorsett Singapore was overall a pleasant one. Upon arrival, I was subjected to a series of health declarations, much more extensive than any other hotels I have visited so far. The reception staff was polite and courtly, and empahsised that due to the size of my room, I could only have a maximum of 2 guests, even though the general guidelines in Singapore say that it's a maximum of 5. That did disrupt the plans a little but I made do.The room had a few minor issues when I first arrived. 3 of the light sources in the room was not working properly, and unfortunately some of the additional things I have requested for was not fulfilled. But they made it up by sending a gorgeous came from the famous Keong Saik Bakery, along with a drawing on the glass surfaces near the door to help celebrate the occasion. These touches made a difference to my overall experience.The room's amenities was comfortable and adequate. The king sized bed was more than sufficient for the two of us and we had a blissful night's rest. Overall, I would recommend Dorsett Singapore for individuals or couple who are interested to explore Chinatown in Singapore.",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

There are construction works going on across the street (you can see them from the pool) but the noise was actually quite okay. The staff is taking the Covid 19 measures serious and are really making their best effort to ensure everybody has the best time while keeping safety and health in mind.

Do NOT pay for the breakfast, the food is not edible and shocking - basics that are very hard to get wrong like bread and eggs were terrible. For some reason they did not provide any local food (which would have been a lot easier to get right given everything else was inedible, even toast!)- The entire hotel is not air conditioned except for your room so when you walk in, it is hot and stuffy which is a terrible experience- Housekeeping service is terrible as per other reviewers and the communication at the front desk is also very badDo not stay at this overpriced hotel.",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

Yadi also managed to get us two tooms on the same floor which was helpful.There is a restaurant on site. But we get the feeling that the staff are overworked.

Great location and a lift away from the nearest MRT station, which pretty much gets you everywhere in Singapore. Reception staff were friendly too. Hotel room is clean and better than expected. However, the hotel restaurant is a total no-no. Food quality is poor for a hotel standard and workers are rude and extremely unhelpful. We went for lunch buffet and food are not refilled, so we were literally scraping off the leftovers.

They are old and dated with a musty smell. More like a cheap 3 star. Also had a bad experience with a dirty towel being left in our room with a dirty plaster on it. When we went down to tell reception and ask them for new towels they didn’t seem bothered at all and got no apology. When we returned we had new towels but they hadn’t taken the dirty ones away. Customer service at reception wasn’t great. There was a lovely lady who served the breakfast who was very friendly and always offered advice on things to do and see.

The room was great, and thought that was enough, or more better than I expect to the hotels I will stay. Lobby was so not that big, but it is a kind of place seems luxurious. This hotel have great location. Almost at the place the hotel is, you can get subway at Outram Station, or Singapore Chinatown is not that far from the hotel.

Included breakfast was tasty and catered to both Asian and Western tastes. A few small quibbles: room design is poor in several ways. No outlet for the hair dryer in the bathroom so have to sit on the bed and use a mirror kind of far away. Shower door skims the floor so tightly that it bunches up the bathmat and you have to step out onto a bare floor, which could be slippery and dangerous.

Very well-managed chain (from Hong Kong) and the room allocated to me is spacious and has excellent city view. It has all facilities including a mobile phone for local use. Service is very good. My previous stays in Singapore have been in 5-stars at Orchid Rd or Marina Bay but this change is a revelation, as Chinatown may be an even more interesting areas to explore (a 5-min walk).One of the best among 4-stars, and good value makes it nearly 5-star.",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

Thanks to the crew for giving room at 9am itself. Total relief.Couldn't get this in the previous visit though.Rooms are decent enough for staying with all the regular amenities provided like toilitries, pool and gym.I would say the breakfast is average rather good. May be because of less vegetarian/indian options for me. Singapore is not aplve where we stay inside the rooms and all we need is a comfortable sound sleep at the end of exhaustive walk or trips/visits of city. Water refill is not unlimited rather you need to buy after 2nd replacement. God, SG is humid and you'll drench like anything. Ani the good thing is the reachability. Outram MRT is underneath the hotel and you can find elevator dedicated for the hotel in the metro. You can reach any place in the city within 20 30 min. China Town and Clarwue kay is walkable distance. Overall its a pleasurable stay without any discomforts. Would like visit again. ",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

The double single bed room was small and tight with very little space to move around.On the plus sides, the beds are comfortable, and the location is on the edge of Chinatown, meaning that you have more eating and drinking options on your doorstep than you could wish for.

Needless to say I had to call THREE times regarding this lost property. I left my name and number over the phone and even had to call from overseas. On the third time, I even sent a photo of the sunglasses!Why was it so difficult for someone to contact me just to let me know what was going on? I guess I’ll never find out As I never heard back.

89,5.0,"Staying at the Dorsett was a wonderful experience. The location was fantastic - right next to the Outram Park MRT with a lift from the MRT to just opposite the hotel and only requiring traversing four stairs and one quiet lane. The Dorsett is walking distance to China Town and Pinnacle@Dutton and in a very lovely area. We used it as a base to explore as far as Tanah Merah to the east and Tuas in the West.The hotel itself had a pretty classy lobby. When arriving desk staff were kind and helpful and there was self-serve calamasi drinks available near the entry. On our last day we inquired about a late check-out and got a one-hour extension (it was all we needed) at no cost and they set up the room keys immediately to confirm this and they were so nice about it. The camera theme for rooms was cute, elevators worked well. The bed is large and comfortable though we found the pillows a little soft. Everything was very clean. There was a window though the view was a bit mundane, excellent air conditioning, a fridge, iron and ironing board, complimentary bottled water each day, a safe, robes. Housekeeping came around 5pm while we were there which seemed a bit late to us. It was a excellent well maintained four star hotel and we probably didn’t use all the facilities available.The bathroom area was like a Chinese puzzle that took us a while to work out. If you find sitting on the loo staring at a full length mirror a bit off-putting there is a sliding door cleverly hidden at the seemingly open entrance. Moving the closet door to cover the area over the sink will give some privacy when exiting the shower or brushing teeth.  There was no laundry line in the shower or bathroom so we resorted to hanging wet bathers on the towel rack over the toilet. This could be different for other rooms of course. There was a scale in the bathroom (which was great as we’re trying to watch our weight and my travel scales weren’t working. We enjoyed swimming in the 3rd level open air pool (pool towels as well as bathroom towels are in your room). We chose not to book a breakfast - preferring to grab smaller meals in Chinatown. We were able to book a standard Dorsett double room for a very reasonable price (chosing no breakfast, non-refundable and booked way ahead) for Singapore and we are incredibly happy we were able to do that. We stayed for four nights and, when some plans changed, considered staying for one more but booking last minute would have been a lot more expensive so I definitely recommend booking ahead. We were very happy with the experience we had already had. The Dorsett is definitely where I would stay again.",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

91,3.0,"Dorsett is a hotel which tries to be a higher class than it is. We had high expectations, not all of which were met. The positives are the location which is excellent, near enough to thw hustle and bustle of Chinatown but far enough away from the noise. Also service is generally very good. The hotel was v responsive to our queries before we stayed there and also allowed us to leave our luggage there days before the check in as we were going to be away from Singapore. After check out, we could also leave our luggage and hotel staff coordinated showering facilities. The room we had was a corner one so we had a nice view of the city. Negatives of the hotel were the standard of housekeeping - there is a distinct lack of attention to detail so replenishment of things like shaving gel, hand lotion etc was ad hoc. Sometimes one towel would be folded & another left, and once we almost ran out of shampoo as levels were not checked and topped up. This had to be brought to the attention of the cleaner. Pillows provided were very high which was quite uncomfortable & when we asked a staff whether there were alternatives she said they were the only ones they have. The recessed shower section was low & drainage was slow so it was easy for water to overrun and wet the floor of the bathroom. On average, staff at Dorsett were helpful and it was a relaxing stay.  With more attention to detail, it could be even better. ",Dorsett Singapore Hotel,4.0

0,2.0,"Booked this staycation using the SGRV. A few hits and misses about this hotel: Let’s talk about the good things first: - Early check-in – Take note to book your check in slot online. There is no notification from Klook to do so. Happened to view the M Social website and saw the check in reservation link. Booked the check in slot for 12pm, and the room was ready when we arrived at 12pm.- Room was generally clean and the bed was comfy but small (see misses below).- Standard hotel items e.g. hair dryer, bathrobes, bath slippers, and toiletries were provided. Tea and coffee were also provided, with a kettle.- Value for money – after utilising the SGRV, we paid only $118 for the room, so cannot really complain but thought I should give me honest feedback on the ‘misses’ so that others can consider if this price is worth the experience. And a longer list of ‘misses’:- Prior to my arrival, I’ve read past reviews online and on TA. Apparently, there WERE complimentary parking at the foyer, a few lots on a first-come-first-served basis. Please note there is NO MORE complimentary parking. We naively parked at the foyer area and proceeded to check in, only to be informed by the hotel staff that the parking is not complimentary. And note that there is NO grace period. For that few mins, we had to pay $5 (refer to the parking rates displayed at the Front Desk)!!! For drivers, pls do not drive past the gantry, into the foyer area. Instead, go straight and turn left to enter the UP@Robertson Quay carpark. Park at level 2 (level 3 is for residents of UP). We parked from 12pm on a Sat to 11am on a Sun, total parking fee was $16 (excluding the $5 we wasted on the foyer parking). Wished that someone had detailed the parking so that we didn’t have to waste $. There is a lift from the carpark that directly leads to inside the hotel.- The check in was done right at the entrance doors to the hotel, which to me was rather strange. After that, we were asked to join the line to collect the room keys from the Front Desk. Not sure why they decided to split the check in process like that, especially when there was hardly a queue when we reached. Couldn’t the Front Desk processed the check in all at once? I can understand if temp and safe entry checks were done at the door, but to have a computer set-up at the entrance to do check in, that’s odd.- The bed was not the usual queen sized bed, more of a super single. And this is the first time that I see square pillows instead of rectangular pillows on a hotel bed, possibly to fit within the bed.- The room was very small, so pls manage your expectations. We got a Loft room with the bed downstairs and a sitting area plus TV upstairs. The TV was very near to the sofa so we didn’t bother watching TV during our entire stay.- The first room we stayed in had a constant dripping sound in the drainage. It was apparent only after we returned to the room after dinner. The technician came by but could not do anything so the Front Desk arranged for us to change room. The second room was better, no more dripping sound, and the air con was not hideously cold. We adjusted the air con to 26 degrees Celsius for the first room, but it was still super cold. And the air con was directly above the bed!- Breakfast was average. We reached at around 9am, and was told that breakfast would take around 30 mins to be prepared. Breakfast was from 6.30am to 10am. Thankfully they served some cereal and tea/coffee while we waited. In summary, would I return to M Social or recommend it to people? It’s probably be a no.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

However, as per her colleague told her that I must request the decoration to be 3 days in advance. Nontheless, Receptionist Syafiq gave me a call back and full-filled my request to inform the housekeeping to set the last minute decoration and he played along with me upon checked in to not asking for the decoration charges $15++ infront of my wife as it was meant to be a surprise.

8,2.0,"This is my first ever complaint at any service establishment; I feel that it is necessary to alert the management to the particularly intentionally contemptuous behaviour of one staff member I had the displeasure of dealing with. I have no problems with M Social and the rest of the staff were pleasant and welcoming. I had my second stay at M Social Singapore from 24-25 March 2021 in room 468, for my birthday staycation. I had ordered food delivery and I called the front desk to request for some cutlery. A lady answered and told me that the cutlery would be sent up. After 25 minutes the cutlery hadn't been received and the food had gone cold, to which I called the front desk again. Shafiq Bin Senen picked the phone up. Upon hearing my request, which I put across politely, I was surprised to hear him rudely tell me that it was hotel policy for guests to go to ground level to pick up the cutlery themselves. I was surprised since this was inconsistent with the first call to which I replied to him (verbatim): ""But that wasn't what was communicated earlier, I have no issues coming down to collect the cutlery myself since it literally takes only 5 minutes for me, but I could have been told so earlier in the first call'. Shafiq went on to again rudely repeat the policy, to which I interjected and told him I would come down to collect the cutlery myself, as there was no point debating this matter. He mentioned that he would deliver it himself and told me to stay in my room. I really hope the calls are recorded so you can hear how polite I was in both conversations. I waited another 20 minutes and nothing happened. I went down myself at this point and to my shock, I was told that Shafiq had ended work and left the hotel. This was intentionally very contemptuous on his part and I was quite stunned by his actions. Here, I also hope you can match CCTV recordings with the timings of my calls to see how this all played out. Bad service is one thing, but to intentionally lie and act contemptuously to a guest on his birthday is really unacceptable. To be clear, I am not writing for recourse but to alert M Social to the incident, as constructive feedback. For your perusal please.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

11,2.0,"My partner planned my birthday staycay which happened over the last weekend and experienced such bad customer service from the reservation team to swear he will not be back. Better if you choose its competitor which also offers loft room.As he engaged a vendor to decorate the room, he asked the team about check-in procedure. But kept receiving generic / robotic responses which were not helpful at all. After many back & forth, the team finally suggested him to check in at around 1+pm on the day, which is understandable as it depends on the hotel's occupancy rate that day. But when the vendor checked into the room at 1.30pm, my partner was shown photos of an uncleaned room (sink was filthy amongst other areas).When it was time for me to check in, there was long queue at the temp screening AND 2 manual check-in counters. We were puzzled because other hotels are doing the staggered check-in timing to prevent crowding. Oh well.Spent 2 nights there but experienced ZERO in-room service. Took 10mins of ringing just to request for 2 btls of water & 2 toilet rolls (because we didn't request for housekeeping). Fridge is tooooo small for cake, wine bottle etc. Flush is weak, sink drainage is poor. Most of all, Front desk requested us to go down to lobby if we need ice bucket. Totally no part of ""social"" we experienced in M SOCIAL. Felt like a chalet rather than a hotel. But i'm sure chalet nowadays are much more than this hotel.Utterly disappointed and sadden that my partner has to waste money in upgrading the room without receiving the corresponding service.

The session was eye opening, providing some basic knowledge of how bartenders mix cocktails. I was pretty pleased with how my mixture turned out and enjoyed it after the session was over together with my dinner. The cocktail shaker that was part of the package was out of stock on the day we stayed so that was a bit disappointing. I was informed at check out it would be mailed out when they have restocked but after almost two months, it still has not arrived. Will it be mailed out soon?Apart from this, the rest of the stay was enjoyable. However, the room and gym were both a bit small though. The gym equipment is very basic and the room felt like a squeeze. But the room was clean and the bed was comfortable so plus points for those.

14,3.0,"We had chosen M Social for a 3 days 2 nights staycaution. In the orginial booking booking we had only booked 1 night however we decided to book another extra night. As it was a last min booking for the  friday night we can't get the standard loft room and I just book a  Premium loft room, thinking we can sort it out later.Upon checking  in , I spoken to the front desk on the issues I had with the booking. As both type of rooms wasn't too far of the price range, I was hoping for an upgrade on the Thursday night. I was rather surprised that he offer to charge me extra  $23 instaed of the $30++ for the update. This is a special discount cos it is my birthday. I was speachless for the above special discount I gotten. I wonder, if he will had advise me to check out and check in the room if i declined on the offer. Upon check in, I requested for 6 bottles of waters as I don't usually requested for room service and do not request for makeup of my room. When the room service girl turn up in the room, she had only 2 bottles of water. I repeated my request for 6 bottles and she informed me I can only request once since I had ask for 6 bottles of water. I am not sure about the others but I do drink a lot of water, do i have to buy bottle drinks for staycaution?  The room was small but the hardware is all good. The hotel had the formula  to be a good 4 stars hotel but the people touch made it  solid 3 stars hotel.It was a birthday staycaution they sure don't make you feel special. The lack of people touch is the key factor. The staffs are not rude at all standard but the message they share with the customers show they are clueless about the hotel business.  Service made a big different in the staycaution, most hotel do the extra steps to make their guest special. M Social is lacking in these areas which is strange as it is a big chain hotel business under the Millennium. ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

20,2.0,"I booked a stay at M Social for Valentine’s Day since due to COVID-19, travel is permitted. As Singapore is a really small country, most couples would have opted for a staycation to celebrate the day but somehow the hotel can be unprepared for this day as check in took more than 2 hours! We had to wait in line outside of the hotel lobby while 2 staff check us in at the door. Instead of just giving us the keys to our room, they were only allocating room numbers. We then had to queue again in the lobby to the actual front desk to get our keys. At the front desk, I was then informed that my surprise was not done in the room. I requested 3 weeks ago for rose petals and an animal towel to be placed in the room for $15++ which I agreed via email. The staff who replied me, Daphne, even said that it will be done. When I probed further with the front desk staff why, he didn’t even apologise. He just said that the surge in crowd was why and that since I wasn’t charged yet, he won’t be charging for it since it wasn’t done. How is that customer service? Someone could have emailed me before this since the hotel should know that Vday is going to be high occupancy BEFORE the actual check in day.My booking also included a $30 dining credit which the front desk failed to provide or inform me about, so I tried calling their operator back in the room. 15mins on the line and no one picked up. I had to go back down to the lobby to ask the front desk for it. So at the same time, I asked if they were understaffed because check-in was slow and no one picked up the phone. The lady said no, it’s because all 170 bookings came to check-in at 3pm thus leading to the queue.The hotel should have expected it since it’s all Singaporeans staying now and your rule of thumb is to check in at 3pm. If you want to solve this, then inform people to come earlier to check-in! No one takes a plane, so no one is going to come late since everyone wants to enjoy their staycay! Fix your service!

The lights were out and the lots were narrow with multiple columns.Took the lift down to lobby and was with a scene from a refuge center with a long queue and makeshift tables for check-ins / outs. There were no clear signages and or staff on hand for crowd control. We had to ask around where to check in.We are still in the queue after 30 mins and it does not look like we will get checked in soon. There is no arrangements at all for the elderly in the queue or any offer of water or drinks. Very unpleasant even before we checked in. ,M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

24,4.0,"It's my first staycation of the year, and I had been eyeing M Social's Mix-and-Stay package for the longest time! Really looked forward to this whole staycay, though right from the start, it appeared the hotel was running late and my room wasn't yet ready when I checked in at the stipulated time of 3pm. Had to wait another 40 minutes for it.Regardless, I got my Loft Gallery room right at the end of the corridor -- Room 213 --which I believe gives me an extra bit of window around the corner that faces the Robertson Quay street!And as much as I truly enjoyed myself, there are some points I think the hotel staff should note. Because on close inspection, the room really could do with some serious overall maintenance. That bit of extra window at the corner I talked about has obviously been uncleaned for the longest time; the dust that had accumulated on the sill is quite substantial. Also, the window blinds there was a little faulty, and I don't know if any hotel staff ever noticed it. I guess less attention is paid to it, because it isn't the ""main"" windows of the room.Fixtures in the room also need some maintenance. Some of the switches are very obviously old, with the stickers peeling off the side. Many of the electrical outlets are also very much scratched through frequent use, which makes it rather aesthetically unpleasing. Worse, there were a couple of electric outlets that had loose covers, I could practically just pull them out and expose the inside. A little dangerous, I'd say.For me, it's also a little unfortunate that the aircon vents are right over the bed. Even with the high ceiling, I could feel the draft on my face when I sleep, which is absolutely terrible for my sensitive sinuses. I had to sleep with the blanket over my face every night.Lastly, the TV remote is a little faulty too. I can't press right or down, only left and up. Of course, I worked around it, but perhaps it should be fixed soon for other guests?Having said all that, I honestly did enjoy my time here very much. It was bliss to just laze around the room, watch TV in the loft. The shower's great, with perfect water pressure. Staff are all generally very nice and helpful, be it the check-in staff, reception, housekeeping, or restaurant. The cocktail workshop was much more than I expected, and I actually learnt something from it -- when all I thought was that I'd have fun! If anything, I absolutely would stay here again. With all those restaurants along the river, meals are absolutely spoilt for choice. The workshops are an awesome touch too -- I haven't seen any other hotels in SG that holds workshops as part of the staycay package, which is the main reason I wanted to stay at M Social!",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

32,1.0,"I often go on monthly staycations in Singapore as a local. M Social happened to be one of those hotels that I have yet to experience. I should have listened to my gut instincts.Stayed for 1 night from 20-21 Dec, on my birthday with a friend. Because of the recent govt initiative that provided locals voucher incentives to explore Singapore attractions, including hotels, the long waiting time made news. During the pre-registration check-in given via email, I selected the 11am-12pm registration slot. Arrived at around 11am at the registration table at the entrance & given a ticket & was allowed to store our baggage. We were pleasantly surprised to be given a call at 12.30pm that a room was ready. Returned at 2.30pm to discover a 7m line of people waiting. But with the ticket, we got a short-cut to the main check-in counter. So, that was great.However, there was a discrepancy noted in terms of the check-out timing.On the email given prior, it stated 12pm. The lady at registration table told us it was 2pm. The man at the check-in counter did not tell us the timing-but it was our fault too, we forgot to ask. So we double-checked later at night. Another lady at the check-in counter said it was 11am. We were ok with the fact that it was 11am, but we were frustrated with the discrepancy, especially when it was stated in black & white. The lady responded that it was an automated response, the check-in timing is now staggered due to COVID & the email was to be ignored. I find that reason inexcusable - a hotel shouldn't provide confusion to the customer & judging by the way the lady responded, well, obviously, required training.I got the Loft Premier room with a double bed at room 661 at level 6. The amenities & cleanliness were adequate. The WiFi was slow & lagging that it affected screen-sharing on its TV several time that we just gave up. The view of of 2 condos with their own pool, which made the hotel lacklustre. The bed was the best feature-we had a great sleep as it was really comfy.Had complimentary breakfast at Beast & Butterflies the next day. Should have just went to cafes nearby-there were great ones nearby such as P.S. Cafe, Common Man Coffee Roasters, as the selections on the menu were severely limited. Went with a friend who is Muslim & wearing a headscarf. We were both aware that the menu was not halal, but we did not request/demand for anything halal, we were just careful with our selection. I ordered cereal & a mushroom omelette for both of us.While I was considering add-ons to the omelette,  their staff, Zack, kept repeating ""with bacon?"" 2 times. I did not request for bacon but it was clear with his tone of voice , the connotation behind it.  The next option in-line on the menu was sausages & other ingredients, so it wasn't an automated response expected because of the menu.When I requested for 'potatoes', he repeated ""with bacon?"" again. I had to look at him sternly in the eyes & said "" Did you hear what I said? I said potatoes, not bacon."" The foreign lady ( ? a Vietnamese) who served us after that seemed to pick up our unhappiness when I requested for Zack's name. She was highly attentive to us & appears to want to appease us, though we didn't kick a fuss or anything. But it was really mean, immature & socially inept of him, in this day & age & especially in Singapore. I would expect this horrible behaviour overseas, but not in my home country & especially not in a hotel.Based on my experience staying in hotels in Singapore, the main reason customers keep coming back apart from providing a clean & comfortable hotel stay, is actually investing in your frontline staff- how to provide a warm, welcoming & non-judgemental service to customers so that they have a great experience. Seriously, if you are considering to stay at M Social, don't even bother. Consider other great hotels with exceptional service & facilities, such as Fairmont, The Fullerton & Marina Bay Sands- you won't go wrong & end up coming back to visit.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
33,1.0,"Stayed at this hotel for 2nights staycation.Plus Points first:Very good hardware used in the hotel, good furnishings, from bed to shower. Very good.Special shoutout to Housekeeping staff: Mr Ken Rock for being so friendly and helpful despite his busy schedule to make up the rooms for the next batch of guests.Now the bad points, bear with me:Frontdesk staff is cold and lack basic customer service skills. The choice of words and the way you say it makes a lot of difference. E.g. It was drizzling and we need to borrow umbrella, we approach the frontdesk, she said can take it ""over there"", pointing to the entrance, could have walked us there or smile and say it.When we approached the umbrella rack to borrow, we told bluntly : one room, one umbrella. You could have said it: Sir, for the convenience of our guests, we appreciate it if you only loan 1 umbrella so that there is enough of other guests in case they need it. Rude.Apparently their IT also cannot make it. My room was booked with breakfast included, their system didn't capture it. I need to show my email booking then they acknowledge it. I paid at the counter for kids breakfast for the next 2 days in advance, unfortunately, it was not captured when we go for breakfast the following day, I need to show my credit card transaction then they acknowledge it. Hello? Global brand?The location is fine and very walkable to Great World City Shopping mall, and its a serene place to stroll in the evening.The saving grace for this stay is Mr Ken Rock from the housekeeping, without him, it is not worthy of even 1 star.

36,3.0,"Mixed feelings about our stay. Nice touches:- bathrobes provided- care pack of hand sanitizer, mouthwash and 2 masks- unique tea choices- motion-sensor switch for bathroom- mini fridge with see-through door. At a glance, we know if we left anything behind in the fridge. Can be improved:- long check-in queue (similar experience to some other reviewers) - somewhat disappointed that our reservation does not include breakfast- no one picked up our calls to M-bassador & front desk when we needed to change a spoilt light bulb. In the end, we told the front desk on our way out in the morning. Thank you for changing the bulb while we were out. - a shelf and additional hooks would be useful for the bathroom - for some unknown reason, the tv switches off by itself- the shower tap becomes almost impossible to turn on when one’s hands are soapy. Given up trying to save water while soaping oneself. If something can be done to the tap so that it could be easily turned on and off, that will be great. Huge plus point - the location is fantastic! Scenic river walks and abundance of eateries in the area. ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
37,3.0,"Stayed on a weekday in December. Hotel was surprisingly crowded, not sure if it was because it is holiday season and Singaporeans are just desperate for a short getaway.Check in/our:Check in time was 2pm. We came around 3.45pm and the queue for check in was still stretched into the outdoor car porch. This took 45 minutes total which was a total bummer/bad first impression already when all we did at the counters was verify our IDs, sign for our room keys and make payment. All that could’ve been done electronically (minus the issuance of keys) to cut the wait time in my opinion. Otherwise, check out was fuss free. Just unfortunate that we could not check out later.Room requests: We made our booking 2 months in advance with requests for our bed to be on the upper level. This was only noted at the point of check in I believe as the service staff just said with nonchalance that this was not available anymore. Room:Small but expected for a loft room. Cozy otherwise for two. The outdoor terrace was nice but we didn’t use it eventually because the sofa was wet from the rain. Room appears hastily cleaned too with leftover confetti on the floors/ dust on the TV/ inconsistent number of toiletries and slippers (they only gave one slipper and bathrobe when there are two guests).The soap bar was expired so we had to ask for a new one. (Expired in 2019)Bed is pretty small for a hotel. It’s not a queen sized bed, just a ?double bed. However we appreciated the Nespresso machine + Google Chromecast facility in the room.One set of CO Bigelow toiletries was also provided which was nice (when we asked one another set, the standard M group hotels toiletry was given).Breakfast:Small selection of food (one continental, one local mains; with kaya toast and eggs + fruits and cereal). Was served a raw egg when I asked for soft boiled eggs mistakenly. Pastries were also not served hot/toasted so they were a bit rubbery. Otherwise Nasi lemak was nice.Others:The hotel actually has a no visitors after 10pm rule which was not communicated to the guests. Unfortunately we had to leave our room for an event and only got back at 11pm with a friend who wanted to come over for a drink and a chat. We were shocked when our friend was turned away at the door and was told that we can sit in the outdoor porch to have our “chat”. They were so strict that they instructed one guest to go up to take our friend’s belongings are she is not allowed into the hotel past 10pm. I can understand that there might’ve been issues with noise in the hotel with some guests throwing parties. But I think it would be more fair to be more flexible with this rule unless the guest is evidently making a lot of noise from their room. Moreover, this rule should be communicated clearly on the hotel website/ during booking and check in so as to prevent visitors from traveling down only to be turned away at the door.Also did not get to use the pool due to the weather. But I understand that only 20 guests are allowed at one time; no booking allows which I can imagine might be an issue as you would never know when the pool is free to use. Would highly suggest a booking system like other hotels have implemented.Overall I think it is a nice hotel but I do not think I would be staying there again as I did not feel welcomed due to the issues highlighted above.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
38,4.0,"When we arrived an hour before check-in time, the queue has began to form. Yet throughout the check-in procedure, we found the staff friendly and patient. The bed and pillows were great for a comfy sleep. Like the idea of the wash basin built in the Alcove Cosy room rather than in the squeezy bathroom. Wish there was some form of door-stop available as we need to keep holding the door everytime we go in and out of the toilet.  A la carte buffet breakfast was great as there were ample enough variety. The kaya toast was my favourite. Clearly, the restaurant was short handed and some of the food we ordered did not arrived and we have to re-order. Yet, the female restaurant supervisor continued to provide friendly service overall. The outdoor pool is nice for a cool dip but lacked a changing room. Hotel design modern and chic.

It took us about 2 hrs in a queue that stretched outside the hotel and almost out the car park. Some of the guests before us didn’t even have their rooms ready.

Sofa was comfortable and wide enough for watching television. I like the ease of use of Apple Airplay to mirror the screen from IPAD to the tv. Understand the design of the table but the material meant that it is easily scratched and scratches are evident on the table legs and top. One should also be careful when climbing up the stairs to the loft as the bottom steps can easily be missed if one is not careful.

Initially wife was abit upset as she thought some of the things were not communicated properly like parking, check in and also items in the package. However, the effort and service from the staff more than make up for it. The staff were friendly( even when faced with a daunting long queue of customers waiting to check in), kept their cool and professionalism.One guy was going along the queue offering cold water and ice cream to those in line! Granted I waited about 35 mins to get to the check in counter which could be improved ( maybe with an app for people to pre-populate guest info, credit card, etc or staggered check in times for different rooms/packages. ) Thanks Andrew for the friendly check in and follow up during the stay!The room (Loft Premier) is clean and cosy. The bed was comfortable and I had two nights of great uninterrupted sleep. Shower had great water pressure. The mixology workshop was an eyeopener too at Beast and Butterflies. It was interesting and fun to mess around with the different liquor and other ingredients, and we get to drink our own cocktail. This is followed by dinner at the restaurant itself. Will probably write a separate review but I think the Team there did a great job too. Excellent service and the food was excellent. Thanks to Kenny, Fiona and amando and the team for the memorable meals.

50,2.0,"We booked the hotel for a 3D2N staycation during the Covid-19 period. The location of this hotel is very far from the nearest MRT station. At least a 15-20 mins walk under the hot sun. It take about 30 mins walk to Clarke quay. There are a lot of restaurants along the Singapore River, so food isn’t a problem. Check in was rather time consuming. Our rooms stank of cigarettes and we had no idea why because this hotel is supposed to be smoke free. The rooms were tiny but luckily the ceiling was high so it wasn’t that bad. The toilet was extremely small and the sink was outside with the bed, which was very strange. I can’t imagine how dirty the toilet door handle is if everyone had to poop and exit to wash their hands in the room. The pillows were square pillows, not very comfortable to lay in. The bed was smaller than a queen size. Facilities wise, the pools were not available unless you book it through the reception, this is understandable due to Covid-19. Also, the hotel is clearly understaffed because we requested for a new toilet roll and it took them 2.5 hours to get it to us. Overall, this hotel is not worth the price and overhyped in our opinion, and we will not consider for a staycation again. ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

Staff was very friendly and I had a medium sized birthday cake bought for another couple of my friends checking in later on, and had requested the staff to kept it in their fridge which they obliged happily. Room was alright. Small but clean. **Tip, if you go to the toilet frequently at night, I will suggest that you don't book a loft room as the bed is upstairs and the washroom is downstairs. I had the free cocktail making session that day that I checked in. Fiona who is the assistant manager was the bartender teaching us the basics of cocktail making. A very interesting and knowledgeable session. Kudos to Fiona for her cheerful, friendly and enthusiastic character in making this session a very fun one.  Breakfast was alright but lack much options. There is only: American Breakfast, Local Kaya toast with soft boiled eggs, and Nasi Lemak. Unlimited servings of course. At least they did it pretty alright on the taste. **Tip, you can ask for fruit platter (not listed in the breakfast menu). I only discovered this on the last day of breakfast when I saw the next table having them. The location of the hotel is good as it is near to many F&B places.

TV is a smart TV that allows both apple and android phones to connect and mirror. You can even watch netflix on the TV using chrome cast.Only downside of the hotel is that it doesn't come with free parking, and parking overnight will cost a bomb.

The room was quite dark but had a large window that helped to offset that issue.However my overall stay was not positive. My shower was freezing cold despite me setting it to the hottest temperature and giving it extensive time to heat up. Due to COVID room service was not running. You have to order your food off of a QR and then collect it from the restaurant and it takes  an hour minimum for the food to be ready for collection. Additionally, only a small part of the menu is available to order from your room and no beverages at all. I had specifically check to see if room service was available before booking and it was still being advertised. the app also seems to have some difficulty as it was unable to process my credit card information and then was unable to process my request to charge to my room.I did not check out the pool as it was raining during my stay.

There were towels in only one of the rooms. We called the front desk and it took 13 mins before someone answered the call. I was told that it would be around $17 for overnight parking. I parked at the parking lots at the hotel entrance. I was shocked when I tried to exit.The parking was $71.50. When I asked the hotel staff, I was told that those parking were for the condo.  I didn't see any sign.  Anyway, the hotel staff were very cold and told me that I could top up my card to pay for the parking.

58,5.0,"Checked out this morning and had to leave a review of our wonderful first stay with M Social! Service: read about the long queues and long waiting time to check in but I guess we got lucky because the whole experience was such a breeze from entrance to room. Greeted at the door by very friendly, very cheerful staff (but you can tell they are quite exhausted and jaded - probably from all the poor guests’ attitudes meh). We booked a klook deal so dude at check-in even ran to grab the heavy Bruno hotplate box from the room. While we appreciated his rushing to see us through the check-in and collection process quickly, we hope that the staff wouldn’t have to endanger themselves in the process. Last thing we want is for someone to fall down and hurt themselves. Service at Beast & Butterflies was prompt and we really appreciated that our server (didn’t get his name but was this really friendly, polite and helpful Indian chap) took the initiative to provide breakfast recommendations and even stopped by to tell us that our order was going to take a while because they are understaffed in the kitchen (seriously, only two pax in the kitchen for breakfast service must have been crazy). His cheerful demeanour definitely made our Sunday! Food: not mind blowing but edible - perhaps their lunch/dinner menus would be better? Room: feels tight for 19sqm but definitely functional, cosy, clean and comfortable. After reading all the poor reviews, we were not expecting to have an enjoyable and restful weekend but we definitely did! And we think that the staff at M Social really can do with more appreciation, especially since they are regular people just like anyone of us - doing their best and earning a living. Nobody wants to be treated badly or to treat others badly.Thank you M Social Singapore team for making our first time experience a lovely one! ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
59,1.0,"Prior to arrival, I asked for early check-in as I needed to setup the room for a surprise. Understood the policy of standard 2Pm check in and early check-in is subject to availability. I arrived at 11.30am, the kind receptionist outside put me on queue list, telling me that they will call me once the room is ready. At 1.30pm, I went up to the another gentleman at the reception to check if my room was ready, only then he went through the system to find a room for me. After check-in, I needed some hand towels to fold towel art as part of my surprise hence I went to the attendant in the corridor to ask him for 6, to which he only gave me two as he said he didn’t have enough, telling me to call down for more. I called down and ask for 4, the Runner handed me 2. As I was in a hurry setting up the room due to time constraints, I didn’t feedback about finding hair  around the room. When I was back to the hotel at night, I asked the receptionist for an ice bucket but I was asked to head to the restaurant to pick one up myself. Back at the room, I called for bottle opener but the hotel could not provide me any, and when we asked for a solution they told us to go to a 7-11. Always thought this hotel was good until I stayed here. ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
60,3.0,"3 days/ 2 nights stay. I must say that the location is great ! Explored around Robertson Quay & there’s a lot of food options. However, service can be much improve/ house keeping staffs are friendly but counter staffs are all very transactional. We requested for an upgrade if available via email earlier due to my anniversary however, staff didn’t acknowledge that during check in until I asked. She mentioned that all the rooms are fully booked & I understand it’s subject to availability but I would appreciate if staffs could take note of these details during check in and not ignore the requests. Rooms are small but functional. & do not expect too much services for what you pay. And they would not accommodate your late check out at 3pm (most of the hotels do so during covid season) even if they have availability if you did an early check in. But overall it’s an okay stay, if you are just there to explore & do not expect great hotel services. ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

Room is also very dimly lit plus it's so close to the apartment opposite that you can see exactly what laundry is hanging out on their balcony once u draw back the curtains! Thus for privacy sake, curtains had to be drawn throughout stay, making the whole experience claustrophobic. Many of the sockets are giving way, couldn't even properly charge the phone or plug in the iron. Far from public transport yet no free parking. Parking is expensive so if you drive, be prepared to pay. Not worth the money at all. For the price, just top up a bit and you can get a much better option elsewhere.

71,4.0,"It was an overall relaxing staycay with my girlfriends. The loft rooms we stayed in are great - pretty well maintained, lovely and clean, fluffy bed although it can be bigger (my girlfriends and I don't feel like it's a queen size bed, more like a super single?). We love the sofa too! Perfect for couch potatoes like us! We checked in on a very warm day and the AC cooled us down really quickly so thumbs up for the powerful AC!Truth be told, I didn't really have anything to complain until the 2nd day which was our check out day. It started off with the breakfast service. While the food was delish, the service quality should be improved. We arrived at a timing which was not as busy because the restaurant was less than half occupied then and we saw a good number of staff on duty. So we ordered our food and within the next 5 minutes, another 2 groups of people were seated near us and they also ordered their breakfast after us. So after another 5 minutes or so, 2 sets of breakfast arrived at our table (although we ordered 4 sets). We waited another good 20 minutes for the remaining 2 sets and guess  what? The other 2 groups who placed their orders later had their food served and they finished the food before our remaining 2 sets arrived! My friend called on a staff to check and she merely brushed us off without bothering to check and come back to us. Eventually our food was served but they are cold. This was disappointing. Waiting for 30 minutes for food that's cold, that's not very nice?Another disappointment was that my friend was told that our check out time was at 11am but the email we received stated 12pm, as well as the website. I approached the guy on duty outside and I was told that the marcomm manager at the hotel has not updated the website but I don't think this was a good enough message you should deliver to guests. The website is supposed to be updated if there are changes. And so, he insisted we still have to check out at 11am.I went in to check with your front desk in the hotel lobby and I was told another story. I was told that due to new regulations, hotel has to stagger check out timings and it would depend on the check in timing. I would have understand the situation. However, this wasn't communicated upon check in, on the website or on our reservation email, how would your guests be aware? Eventually we were given our check out at 12pm after we showed our emails. We appreciate this gesture of honouring what was committed to us.Last feedback - your lifts. I noticed there are at least 4 lifts but only 2 are operating? During ""peak"" timings such as breakfast or check out hours, the lifts are full. Talking about social distancing, there was none. Everyone on the lower floors would want to squeeze into the lift because it was quite packed already when the lift came down to the lower floors where we were staying. We waited quite a while just to get into the lifts and I heard that it was the same for the other guests staying at lower levels. If you anticipate that the hotel is going to be full, it will be good to have all 4 lifts operating during peak hours to improve the crowding situation.I still give a 4 star rating because I really feel that these are small things the hotel could have done better with proper feedback taken into consideration. Also I do feel that the room is indeed nice and cool. My friends and I had an awesome time until the hiccups came on the 2nd morning.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

73,5.0,"To be honest, I had my doubts when choosing M Social for a staycation. However, upon arrival, I realised that the photos of the room on websites did not do it justice! It looked so much better in reality compared to the photos taken by previous guests and other reviews.Check-in: The queue WILL be long due to its popularity and extra measures implemented for COVID-19. Hence, I'd suggest coming 1-2 hours after the check-in timing if you would prefer not to queue 45 mins to check in.Washroom: It felt very modern. The glass wall between the room and washroom made it look very chic. I also liked how the blinds for the glass wall are built into the wall so it doesn't get wet. Unfortunately, there wasn't a bidet for the toilet.Shower: Rain shower head and handheld shower head, no issues with the heater at all.Sink/Mirror: We loved the vanity light! It was really good lighting for washing up and for lighting the room (it was located in the bedroom instead of the washroom).A/C: Worked great. It is completely silent to the point where we didn't know if it was working until we felt the change in room temperature.TV: Sadly, the TV didn't have ChromeCast built-in, so we had to watch Netflix on our phone (Netflix no longer supports AirPlay). Though, the TV had cable, so channels like HBO was available.Fridge/Kettle: Fridge was little small, but it could fit our little drinks and tidbits. There were complimentary bottles of water as well. Kettle works fine (for those who crave instant noodles in the middle of the night).Lighting: The lighting here is absolutely fantastic for taking photos. The vanity mirror is also aesthetic enough to capture a shot for Instagram.Clothes Rack: Rather small, but I guess if they were to put a whole closet, it'll take up too much space. There were only 3 hangers on ours but you could always ask the M'Bassador to send more to you. M'Bassadors: Essentially the hotel employees at the Front Desk. They were very hospitable and served our every request. Stained your bedsheets? They'll send housekeeping right up. Need more towels? Here you go! They didn't make us feel bad for asking as well. :)Room service: You could order from the room but you'll have to collect it at the restaurant. (Also: They allow food delivery to the hotel but you'll have to collect it yourself.)Gymnasium/Pool: We didn't use the pool because it was raining and we're not a couple who goes to gym on vacation LOLLocation: There are quite a number of restaurants nearby but they're rather pricey. Nearest bus stop to Chinatown Point/Plaza Singapura was a little bit far (about 400 metres away) but we got to enjoy the quay vibes as we walked to it anyway.Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay at M Social.

Our staycation was 3D2N.Breakfast - it was super understaff and waited for 45mins for our food to be served.What horrified us was the lack of and poor management - We went out during Saturday's check-in time, there was a long queue. Long story short, we heard that the longest waiting time to check in was 4 hours.During the late night, we needed some room service to deliver some items - called for almost an hour, but to no avail. Hence we went down and realised that there was only 1 person at the floor.Overall stay aside from the breakfast, all good as we also had a complimentary cocktail making lesson and the room was cosy though small.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

80,2.0,"Firstly, our room was not ready till 4pm, I don’t expect an early check in,but room not ready at 4pm on a Friday afternoon? Come on.. Secondly, this stay was to celebrate my fiancé’s birthday on the day itself, priory to our arrival, staff committed there will be cake or some voucher. Guess what, there’s nothing. Not to mention there isn’t any greeting despite they did registration for him too. Last but not least, when I was asking for a bucket of ice, the answer I got was I have to go down to the restaurant to pick it up. Aside from the service level, the size of the room. Be prepared..I guess during this challenging period, hotel is short of staff but, management, please take care of your staff’s moral. Only if you take good care of them, your staff then can take care of your guest. Nevertheless, this was a very disappointed stay. Will not come back again. ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
81,5.0,"Decided to support our local hotels and found a good deal on Agoda for an alcove cosy room. The room was not big but was as described, cosy and stylish. The staff were friendly and not as described in some other reviews and they seem they were trying their best to manage the situation. There was a queue of about 10 people when we arrived but after completing the declaration form and safe entry, we proceeded in to collect our keys and were off to our room. If there was anything to gripe about, The pool was rather small. All in all, a good staycation!",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
82,2.0,"Through my short stay with M Social Singapore, I believe they really have a huge room for improvements. Firstly, I was given keycard access upon check-in when my assigned room was not ready. As I had to start my work online, I dialled to the reception multiple times with no response. In the end, I had to resolve issues such as blinds not shutting properly and the lack of toiletries at the front desk. Secondly, it could have been due to the room hasn’t been fully ready but, there were dust in various corners of the rooms. Thirdly, when I did my booking, I left a remark that it was my birthday and, being under the Millennium group, entitled me to a birthday treat (voucher for dessert for M Social), which was missed out during my check-in. However, on the bright side, the wifi works great and the room had pretty good lighting to work with due to its high floor-to -ceiling windows. Would give them a second try in hopes for future improvement.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
83,5.0,"It was an amazing experience staying in M social. We took the 3D2N Alcove Cosy room with Perfume making + Cocktails making package. Check in was smooth, took less than 20min and the room is quite spacious for 2. There is also gym and swimming pool facilities if you need some outdoor activities.On our first night, we had cocktail making session by Vladyslav. Vlad was very friendly and knowledgeable. He taught us the steps on how to create a cocktail and types of alcohol by smelling. We get to choose our base and a few other juices to match it. Shaking a cocktail also have technique! The whole workshop was about 95min. But YAYYYYY we created our own free customised cocktail and get to drink it! Cheers ~Breakfast menu was quite simple. Due to Covid, it’s ala carte menu not buffet. There were only about 5-6 selection of mains but you can add on the side dishes if you don’t want a full meal. Service is slightly slower, took around 25min from ordering to serving the food and another 15-20min if you re-order again. On the second night, we had our Perfume making with Novalia. She is a nice, helpful and professional lady. During the workshop, she give us some background on the perfume Brand’s. When choosing our own scene, she would constantly encourage us to smell more, till we find what we like as it’s our personalised perfume. There was no rushing to end the workshop. On top of that, she would recommend some smell that she felt amazing based on the flavour we preferred. We managed to get the smell we want and it’s perfect. Totally love this workshop!!! Would highly recommend this staycation/getaway/mini honeymoon trip if you’re looking for one now. The experience is just different with the two workshop in your stays at M social.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0
84,2.0,"Stayed in the alcove terrace room. Regrets...Shocked to the see that the wash basin is outside of the toilet and in the room itself? Imagine doing your business in the toilet and yet you have to come out of it into the room to wash your hands? The room is small so prepare yourself to have your toes get hurt hitting the sharp legs of the bed every now and then! The outdoor chair could have a proper wicker sofa instead of the cloth because when it's raining, there's no way you can sit on it until it totally dries up. There were also only one robe in the room, and when I asked for another one for my partner at around 11pm, the front desk mentioned that the housekeeping department was already closed and I have to head down to the front desk to collect myself. No toothpaste travel kit in the room. I literally felt like I am staying in a budget hotel.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

Received the room keys after registration , and within minutes we were in our Alcove Cosy Room. It was the right decision booking M Social, as we had such a good night’s rest. The night curtains worked wonders in blocking out any morning light and the bed/pillows was just very comfortable for us. Air condition was just right too.We woke up feeling really very fresh , we did not realize it was morning already as the night curtains blocked out any light from the room.Luckily, we made it on time for breakfast at Beast&Butterflies as we woke up only at 9:45am, and breakfast ends at 10am. Breakfast was great too ! Enjoyed the room so much we did not explore the surrounding area around the hotel. But i think it won’t disappoint. Recommended for a short stay !

The staff made sure that we are all safe to enter. The hotel was near to great world city. We just have to walk around 15 min to reach there. The inside of the room was really nice but pretty small. My room came with a tree resting place which was located outside. The bed is located on top of the loft. So no disturbance from tv. Just sleep.We had dinner at Beast & Butterflies. Which is the best for the day. But it is a bit pricy. We took a stroll after our dinner and end up in Great World City to get the awfully chocolate. The stroll was filled with people. And a lot of dog lovers. We enjoy the after meal breeze walking. Overall the whole experience was good. We will come back to stay again.,M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

91,4.0,"Just ended our staycation at Msocial today. It was a home away from home for the two of us! We stayed on Sunday-Monday to celebrate my birthday. When checking in, there was a long queue and I realised that it was the same when I checked out too and the other guests were checking in. Maybe what the hotel could do is to open up more counters / install self check in kiosks to facilitate the overwhelming queue in the future and that the workload of the front desk personnel could be minimalised. :) Our initial booking was for the loft room but due to technical difficulties on the air conditioner my partner was given the information an hour prior to check in. However, I have to say that the manager Gretchen handled the situation with upmost professionalism! We didn’t get to stay our initial room sadly (but we hope to be back a third time next for it!) but what made up for our stay was Gretchen’s excellent service recovery! I can’t express my gratitude more to Gretchen & her team of staff working at the Msocial for keeping their smiles on and keeping calm throughout constant long queues and waiting period of guests. It’s not an easy period for all of us but I have to say from the bottom of our hearts, we are very appreciative of your service.The room was cozy, comfortable, and clean too! The breakfast took a little longer than expected but I believe it was because it was peak hour, but the service staff at beast & butterflies were responsive and paid attention to detail. I have to also commend the housekeeping staff for their efficiency as well. Overall our stay was very comfortable, service of the staff was commendable and I’m glad my partner chose to come back and celebrate my birthday with a stay at Msocial again.

92,2.0,"I visited M Social and was thoroughly disappointed in a number of items:- After checking in, we found that our room was extremely stuffy, very dusty and we could even see food from the previous traveler left behind. So we asked for it to be thoroughly cleaned again. This is VERY shocking and disappointing as I was under the impression that being SG clean, M social would put more effort into disinfecting and sanitizing the room.- there was no chair in the room despite it being a business hotel and when we asked for one, we were told it was designed to be this way. That’s really inconvenient as we had to work from our beds or floors... - our door lock spoilt and locked us IN the room, and the next day it locked us OUT because of the battery issue. M social came to fix it immediately so that’s fine, but I think a room like this shouldn’t be rented out until you have fixed the lock because I’m sure it’s not the first or second time it has happened for this room. Honestly, if it’s just one of the items listed above that happened I would have been okay with it but it was the cumulation of ALL of the above that really pushed me past my tipping point. I hope M social will review their cleaning standards and ensure the rooms are 100% good to go before letting it out. ",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

Location is fairly convenient. Unfortunately, the only problem we faced was that the hotel per se does not have any complimentary parking spaces for us guests when we arrived. Yet when I booked on their millennium website directly, it did state that there was a free parking space. However, Manager explained apologetically to us that it was because we did not book online through M Social instead but millennium(which would have stated it does not have foc parking).Extremely misleading on their part.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

96,3.0,There is a lot of work that needs to be done. Bad air con. Air con tec had to do air con servicing while we were in the room. Even after that is didn’t work.No mini fridge to chill your drinks.Long curtains are pretty however when I moved it I could feel dust fall onto my face and eyes. Complimentary ice is till 10pm and must be self collected at the restaurant beside the hotel. Basically it’s not convenient. Hotel level corridor stinks of food gone bad and staff do not do their rounds to freshen up the area. Housekeeping literally opened my room door. When we had just checked in. There was no proper info was passed front office to housekeeping. Clearly mentioned we were celebrating a birthday prior booking. Hotel staff mentioned there will be a dessert voucher given during check in to dine in at their restaurant. During check in nothing was given. & when we went up to our room and gave them a call they mentioned it must be on the actually birthday. Maybe you should explain this earlier. Not everyone has the liberty to celebrate on their actual birthday.12.30pm (late check out) was the check out time provided for us. At 12pm when we went down to collect some stuff and made our way back to the room the key card was already deactivated.

To celebrate the occasion, we paid for an upgrade to the Terrace Loft (212), however the room we got wasn’t complete. There was only 1 bathroom towel, no face towel provided and the in-room phone was disconnected and no phone was replaced.We called the reservations team from our own mobile phone to inform and only the towels were delivered to us. Till we checked out, no technician came to the room to replace the phone even though the FO ensured that they’ve keyed into the system. The towels at the pool were stained and looked like it wasn’t cleaned well. On our second night, we went out and switched on the make up room light. We came back to only have the beds cleaned and towels replenished. Our bottled water was not replenished and bath robe still wet.

99,4.0,"From the past reviews, there were issues with the newly implemented processes post covid, but it's good to see the improvements. 1. Though queue to enter is long on a Sat, there's 5 staff facilitating the check-in process (1 at entrance, 4 at check in counter). It's quite fast. Professional team at work.2. As it's a stay to celebrate my partner's birthday, I have personally emailed the reservation team to see what services I can get from hotel. Darshan and Mandy has promptly responded to my query and informed us services they have like deco at xx$, also offered complimentary dessert voucher. While that being said, the actual day caught me off guard as I didn't take on the deco package but found it done within the room. Instead of dessert voucher,we were offered two welcome drinks at their restaurant. Cheers to the excellent m social team. 3. Response time from the team was fast when we called for additional shampoo and body wash at late night, within 5 minutes, the staff came with a few bottles and greeted us with smiley face. Good job to the team. 4. Breakfast menu was decent and served to you instead of self collected buffet. I went as early as 7am and greeted by the friendly staff. The drinks and meals were served fast. It tasted normal hotel food. Can see a few new hires as an improvement from the reviews stating only one ground staff. However, there were a few jokes moments which caught me off guard from the wonderful experience thus far. Can tell the staff serving us is definitely new, maybe she is nervous. So ordering was a little challenging as you need to help her abit. Also, the Tea label was fully intact soaked.  my partner ordered the same from another staff was done correctly with label out.- food came cold for mine. Especially I expected the scramble eggs to be hot or warm. - ordered harshbrown as part of the American breakfast set.  However, didn't get it.  - ordered English breakfast tea.  However, I see no tag hanging outside of the cup. Saw the string inside but thought it broke, that's why.  However, it shocked me towards the end when I pulled the Tea bag out realising that the staff dropped in the whole bag into the water without dismantling the label and string. It was fully intact and dropped into the water to brew. . Wells, I am glad the Tea label is plastic sealed and not paper. Though,it seems that the label couldn't stand being soaked in hot water also. Else, I will be drinking dissolved paper tea.- ordered ""fragrant coconut rice... "" in short, nasi lemak. Also, ordered harshbrown and mushroom omelette. But what came was shocking and funny, cause they replaced the fried chicken wings with the harshbrown and the omelette with mushroom omelette. We had a good laugh but oh wells, kind of full already, so didn't pursue with the staffs. 5. Check out was fast. Just have to drop the cards.6. Not forgetting that we had mix and stay package, the staff scheduled us for a class at 3pm, promptly happening after check in. The class is an hour. We were guided by vuad, the bartender. Received a complimentary shaker, which vuad also kindly taught us how to use. In summary, can consider if you are not perfectionist. To be honest, the stay is memorable with a range of emotions.",M Social Singapore Hotel,4.0

Waitress served tea and coffee without sugar or milk, and she seems unhappy to bring the sugar to us. We book a loft room, with an extra bed at the lower level, it was super squeezy for 3 adults. There was an unpleasant stench on the fabric sofa, the management should look into this. Called up the hotel a couple of times for early check in but was told to call on day of check in.

17,5.0,"The hotel lobby is small but it didn't fill up when I was there.  Plenty of seating area for guests to wait (lobby and the adjoining cafe).  Staff were friendly, welcoming and gave clear instructions (health declaration, SafeEntry, etc.).  Check-in was smooth but had to wait a short while for rooms to be ready.  Staff informed of complimentary drinks and to wait at Blue Jasmine, an in-house restaurant on Level 5.  Was able to sit, rest, have a drink and wait for the staff to approach you at your table with your keycards once your room is ready.  This is such a thoughtful gesture.The hotel is located diagonally across the road from City Square Mall and right behind the Little India MRT Station Exit A.  There is a 7-Eleven at the station exit and there is a 24-hour access at One Farrer Hotel right beside where there’s a restaurant, Killiney and 7-Eleven there too.  The Little India precinct and Mustafa Centre are also a short walk from there.Room was clean, tidy and neat. It was a Premier Loft room and the rollaway bed was already set up for the 3rd adult.  The rollaway bed does make the lower deck of the room tighter to manoeuvre but it was fine for 3 adults.  The metallic strips on the steps to the upper deck of the room might be a little uncomfortable to step on for some people so be sure to make use of the in-room slippers provided!  The TVs had a good range of local and overseas channels (Nat Geo, HBO, DW, RT).  There is one remote control provided for two TVs (one in front of the bed on the upper deck) but you’re able to request for an additional one.  Water is provided, along with The 1872 Clipper Tea Co. tea bags & Nescafe Gold coffee sachets, double-walled mugs and the usual toiletries.  There is a seating spot in the closet (probably for you to wear your shoes while seated).  Two aircon vents were available and it might get too cold for those in the upper deck because the aircon vent blows directly onto the bed on the upper deck.  There are nightlights installed at the steps so these lights may stay on overnight and provide a safe option for guests coming down from the upper deck.Had dinner at Blue Jasmine on my first night and they had both ala carte dishes as well as an ala carte buffet.  For the price of the buffet, there should be a wider variety of dishes available but the taste of the food was great and portion is reasonable.  The restaurant was probably 2/3 full and the food service had slowed down.  Though the dishes were cooked on-the-spot upon ordering, they could probably use one more chef to assist in expediting the cooking of the dishes.  Was served by Lewis and he provided great service, though he had been working long hours.  One thing to note is that their desserts are served “bite-sized” so feel free to order more quantities for yourself and they tasted really yummy!Breakfast was served at the Blue Jasmine too and due to the limited size of the restaurant in addition to safe distancing rules in place, we were informed beforehand to try and avoid the peak time of 8am-9.30am.  I went for breakfast at 9.45am on the second day and 7.30am on the third day.  There were 3 fixed breakfast sets available daily with a fourth Chef’s Special which differed from day-to-day.  It was porridge and laksa on my second and third day respectively.  Eggs made-to-order were also available in addition to the breakfast sets.  Food portions were good and you can request for more if you like.  During longer waiting times, the staff will provide pastries for us to munch on while waiting.  They will also provide yogurt cups and fruits.  I learned that they had seconded staff from their corporate side to assist during breakfast timing at Blue Jasmine.  I think this is pretty thoughtful of the hotel to ensure service doesn’t get delayed during busy hours.All in all, it’s been a great stay. Comfortable room, great service, tasty food and a good location.Tip: Some people get confused with a hotel right beside, so ensure the name and address of hotel when making travel arrangements (PHV/Taxis).","Park Hotel Farrer Park, Singapore",4.0

They doorbelled several times to check if we are in the room but I was using the shower and my partner was asleep - so we could not answer the door on time and they barged in (my shower door was not even fully close and i was not clothed). Our room cleaning switch was not on as well. It was traumatising and a very horrible experience. No compensation was made to us... and the hotel staff (we are not even sure if they checked the CCTV and took action). We do not know who came in as we were both engaged. It was truly an invasion of our privacyBecause of the incident that happened - we are very doubtful to stay here again.

0,1.0,"Arrived with my kids around 9pm. So tired for the whole week and checked in to this hotel hoping for a relaxing experience. Check in process was normal but they said they can only give standby key for some reason. I don't mind any key as long it works.When we went up, the so called key was not working and I went to the phone nearby asking for help. The front desk guy said he will come up now. After several minutes, no one came and I kept calling the front desk and used the chatting function. After 10-15 minutes waiting at the door with kids lying on the hallway carpet and sweating due to not so cold air-condition, 1 lady arrived without saying anything until I said something. She just replied without even mentioning sorry ""oh, dah lama ke tunggu?"" or in english ""oh, how long did you guys have been waiting?"". Problem 1 - If the key system is failure, why did even the standby key is not working? Apparently no one tested this before asking any customer to go up. I settled down and the kids were happily in their bed. Suddenly a knock on my door and I opened it. There was a staff brought some snacks and she offered to put it inside my room. After a while, she realized that the snacks are already there in the room and she left. I was confused and wondering why did I even wasted my effort to ask my kids to behave and allowed the staff to waste my time.Problem 2 - What happen to the daily checklist during the cleaning process? Furthermore now is not a peak season and all these should be under control. There is no need to unnecessarily wasting guests' time. I've rarely complaint but for me, if the basics are not well served or taken care, the other things such as other services might be even worse.After spent more than 250 nights in 2020 only with other hotel chain, this year Ive been offered a status match. Will I proceed with the journey to get their loyalty membership status? I need to think twice after this incident.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5
1,4.0," Booked 3 rooms for our reunion Dinner.Breezy Suite, Urban Double, Standard Room.We ordered the packaged Chinese New Year dinner and got the team at Aloft to serve it in the suite.Food was good and worth the money. The Team were friendly. And the rooms were of a good value.I booked all three rooms under my Marriott Bonvoy account but some how the room still isn't featured on my profile. And the air-conditioning isn't cold. And the blinds In the urban room didn't work.Hence the 4 stars out of 5.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

3,2.0,"There are a few points I have noted in this stay. a) Check in - it was alright but I hv commented the staff made me move to a specific area to check in (with the transparent shield), which I am totally fine to abide to the rules they have set. But when another guest did not do the same the staff was ok with it? Why wasn't he told to go to the shield? Also, he pulled his mask down beneath his chin (pictured)... So the staff had just exposed himself right? Immediately felt double standards.... And had raised this to another staff. Hopefully no more recurring of such incidents.b) Room - dark, tired & basic. Somehow the design of the room is weird. But, can't complain for the price and this cannot change.c) Request for amenities - it takes forever. If you can wait for 3 hours. Called, texted in the chat, yet the wait is still long. Subsequently told them to leave it at the lobby and I would pick it up. Which they did do it (much faster).d) Food - it was okay, but note that the food are mostly microwavable or reheated food. Limited to certain set and you can't switch for room service but you can at the cafe. Slight flexibility. I had their buffet before and this cafe style is a far cry from the delicious buffet. Understood they need to cut cost so... it got to me that the room rate had deducted the buffet price so can't complain...e) Mini Bar - Only one beer and one of each item. Isn't it strange to have 2 person staying but only a can or beer. It's might as well don't give it at all. Everything in mini bar can be eaten but non-refillable. You can pay for the refill.f) Upgrades will be available but not to suite as they are not some partner etc etc. So Platinum members don't expect anything. Late check out will still be available. g) Parking - hazardous. You will be charged everytime you leave the parking because it is not owned by them. Looks like they did not establish a partnership w/ the company. Means, if you leave the hotel within the same day for 3 times, you need to pay 3 times parking (flat rate of RM10 if I remember correctly). Decided to take Grab to go out for dinner since they did not have parking flexibility. Parking is per entry, not per stay.h) Welcome gift - the card is clearly not for me... Mr Pekka (Titanium) and welcome back, but that incorrect. Appreciate their gesture but at least, get my name correct.i) Elevator - only one elevator is working. Takes a long wait to get up and down (also limited people can be inside the elevator due to social distancing).Rubel Miah (GM) did send an email to address the issues after he had received the survey feedback from me. I did not reply to the email (as I had forgotten until today) but here is my reply. Good pricing, even better location, just that I hv concluded that I won't get much service or a truly memorable staycation kinda thing. It's really a place just for you to touch and go - as long as you can stay, clean place to shower, convenient and get on with life. And at least the GM takes feedback very seriously - just not sure if there is an action plan for it since I have not returned. I would pay more for a better quality Marriott property.... But this is just me. Unless Aloft can prove the quality it is unlikely I would be back....",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

6,2.0,"1. The hotel room was booked in short notice, but it was available and ready for early check-in. The reservation line was busy, so I dropped a voicemail, and the hotel returned the call. I should’ve taken that as a hint that it was difficult to contact the hotel.2. The room was clean and quite spacious. It had a funky design, true to the Aloft brand. The usage of sliding doors cleverly maximises the space of the room.3. I’m impressed with the quality of the coffee & tea facilities and the bottled water, which were of high quality.4. The linen and bedding were clean and comfortable. The robes were plush and super comfortable!5. The toiletries were basic and did not satisfy. The shower gel did not lather very well.6. I went to the breakfast buffet and paid as a walk-in patron. At RM60 per pax, the semi-buffet spread was not as diverse as expected. Therefore, it was expensive for me.7. A chef at the live station near the sausage reminded me to put on the mask at the buffet line. Kudos for her for enforcing the SOP.8. Special shoutout to Ms Yap & Ms Racheal for good services. Both of them actually served our drinks to the correct patron. The others put the drinks we ordered next to our table. That was a kind of service you normally see at normal Malaysian eateries, not at a hotel.9. The pool area was well attended to, and physical distancing SOPs were enforced. Each patron was given an hour to swim. An infinity pool overlooking a small part of KL skyline was refreshing nevertheless.10. Surprise #1: The breakfast buffet is not applicable for Club Marriott (CM) dining discount. I asked for an explanation, but Ms Yap only explained that the CM dining discounts are only available for lunch & dinner. I requested an explanation again during checkout, showing the benefits page on the CM website, and again, the same explanation was given. I am waiting for official clarification from CM.11. Surprise #2: Parking was shockingly expensive. As a guest, I was charged RM10 per entry after my ticket was validated. As a comparison, guest parking at Le Meridien is only RM3. Both hotels are in the same area.12. Surprise #3: The hotel is impossible to reach. I was not happy with the explanation during check out, and the receptionist gave me a business card. I must’ve called the number given at least four times, at different times, to no avail.13. Overall, the staycation was not a memorable one. Even though the room rate was cheap, the parking and the breakfast made it hardly value for money. With the lack of satisfactory explanation & difficulty to contact, it’s hard for me to return to this hotel again.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

So glad the hotel allow me to early check in, the room is as usual very clean and perfect for work! Shout out to all the staff through the hotel, restaurant and pool deck. Your smiles makes me feels more home rather than a hotel. The breakfast is strictly with SOP too, the food has limited choices but it’s enough for me and the quality of the food is GOOD!

Ordered Rib eye steak which have the same quality like a famous steak house and they really take pride of the food decorations.

28,5.0,"As a Marriot Bonvoy member, I stay at the Marriot chain hotel a lot, especially when I was in Kuala Lumpur. I decided to give Aloft KL Sentral a try, as staying at Majestic Hotel which I always frequented seems not to be a good idea. I just don’t want to be stuck in a 100 years old colonial building in a quiet corner of Kuala Lumpur city during this time when the occupancy is low. Being somewhere a bit more bustling maybe could do me good. But oh boy, I kid you not, I get more than that.Check-in was fast. The Covid-19 SOP complied strictly. The staffs were really nice. What I requested prior check-in through the Marriot Apps was waiting for me in my room. The room could be one of the cleanest hotel room I’ve ever been, maybe the big room and modern sleek interior add up to the feeling. Plus, the view was great, which include the swimming pool. However, my nightmare started around midnight. I could hear my neighbors doing their business and laughing loudly as if the night is still young. I called the front-office twice, only to be assured that they had reminded the noisy neighbor to keep the noise down. But it still recurring up to about 2 am in the morning. They finally took my complaint seriously after I recorded the noise using my phone and ran down to the lobby to use it as evidence as proof that I am not that “another fussy guest”.In the morning, due to the lack of sleep, I just flipped at the restaurant while having my breakfast because I was seated next to a table where the diner (a famous person whom shall not name) inconsiderately decided to have his breakfast while watching YouTube (a speech or something) on his phone without an earphone, full blast. They willingly change my table, thank you. Positive note: the restaurant (Nook) staffs were really nice, no complaints that the breakfast does not fully buffet, the toast that I had was amazing.What I want to highlight here is the recovery action taken by the staff. I lodge a complaint to the restaurant manager who was very apologetic. She wrote down my complaint and promise to highlight it during a meeting which she would attend later. It is good to know that when I call the reception later to ask whether my neighbor would be staying for another night (I know I am a patience person cause many of you would not consider that at all and would check-out immediately and stay at another hotel for the remaining night), they told me that they knew about my predicament as it has been highlighted by the restaurant manager during the meeting, as promised. They offer a change of room and I was upgraded, and later a fruit plater and apology note arrived in my room, followed by a phone call asking whether everything is okay a WhatsApp message, and an email much later.I know that sometimes things could be out of control (save for the night manager who could handle things better), but if things get worst, the recovery action taken by the staffs is the thing that could tell you whether the hotel cares about the guest and whether the hotel worth to be revisited again, albeit the hiccups. For this, I believe Aloft KL Sentral handles it well. Hence, not only that I will give Aloft KL Sentral another chance (which I am looking forward to) but also other Aloft Hotel too.

45,1.0,"It’s the long Merdeka weekend. We had earlier planned a day trip to Bentong followed by an overnight stay in KL. We booked two rooms at Aloft KL Sentral on 25 August 2020 via Agoda, REQUESTING them to be adjoining and for check in at 1.00 pm. (Adjoining rooms are advertised in their website and also third party travel sites).Booking acknowledgment received, apart from which, there is no further correspondence. Come 30 August 2020, we arrive at the hotel at 1.00 pm. Of course, SOP in place. We entered the MySejahtera app for all of us, then filled a questionnaire, then checked temperature. We had to queue for the check in. Only two people in front of me. Check-in staff initial: DD says that rooms are being cleaned, and that we will have to wait. She gives a temporary card, then takes my number and says she will call when room is ready. “We will try to give you the room soon. If we don’t call you, please come back at 3.00 pm. You must QUEUE AGAIN, and then show me the acknowledgment card”. I said ok. There was no mention of adjoining rooms so I assumed it wasn’t not an issue. We waited.......It was 2.45 pm. We sat at the lounge, noted the queue getting longer and longer. NO SOCIAL DISTANCING being practiced. I subconsciously take off my mask while sitting in an isolated lounge chair and another male staff reprimands me to wear it. BUT NO SOCIAL DISTANCING at the queue area!!!!!!!!The crowd!!!!!! I thought you were supposed to control the number of people in the lobby? Oh, for the sake of business, all SOPs out of the window???????? Customers must obey the rules but hotel can break the rules? (At this point, I was tempted to take a photo of the area and the hotel’s non-compliance, but it’s rude to take a photograph of others, so I refrained from doing so....)Anyway, it’s 2.50 pm. I walk to the separate Customer Service Counter, as the Check-in counter had about 15 people queueing......I ask, “My room available?”. A few calls, then “No sir, you will need to wait”I said ok. But I said, “I want my room at 3.00 pm sharp”. (If you cannot give and take a little, I won’t either). 2.59 pm. Still no sign of my room. Another person in my party is in the LONG check-in queue. When we finally get to the counter...... “Your rooms aren’t ready. Sorry sir.” I then Insisted they give me my rooms. Due to the the pressure I was giving them, they finally gave in, but only a little. “We can only give you one room now. Both rooms are in the same floor, but only one is available”. Me: Are they adjoining like I requested? ND (initials): No sir. Sorry. It’s subject to availability (not true, as they advertise it as being available) I then started making a fuss. I booked two rooms, adjoining, but now they say it’s not available. Then why advertise as those “available”? And when I booked, they should state if it is available or not. I said, “I want to see your manager”Next comes RY (initials)“I’m sorry sir. It’s a long weekend, and it’s always like this on weekends. I’m sorry if you’re unhappy, but we need to manage the crowd and you will have to wait.  Please use one room first, and when the next is available, we will give it to you. It won’t be adjoining”. I said no. And I said, “It’s now 3.10 pm. Will you refund me for the 10 minutes I am not occupying the room?”RY: I’m sorry sir. If you want, we can cancel your booking and refund your entire amount.I decide to take the refund. Why?1. I don’t think I will be enjoying my stay here the rest of the time, as I’ll be unhappy about this ordeal2. I cannot imagine the drama during the next morning’s breakfast (the hotel clearly cannot manage their own guests, as they have failed miserably in their first impressions in more ways than one)3. The rooms aren’t adjoining, and I have two teenage kids4. One room isn’t ready and I don’t know when it will be ready (and it appears they don’t either!)5. The way their SOP is going, I felt insecure. They want me to sit in their lobby to wait with a mask on, but they haven’t made any attempt to clear/control the crowd in any way. When I commented about this to RY, she said, “It’s just the way it is on weekends and we cannot do anything to improve on it”We have stayed at this same Aloft hotel before, and it was wonderful. How things have changed...... We have also stayed at many Marriott hotels around the world. Never would I have thought that I would be disappointed like this at a Marriott. The first thing that comes to my mind is that the entire crew appear lost. They don’t seem like they are trained in the Hospitality Industry, although this is entirely my opinion. They seem to give abrupt answers. They weren’t courteous and had no tact. I sincerely hope the respondent doesn’t say, “please take our discount of 10% the next time you decide to stay with us”, because there won’t be a next time for me at the Aloft KL. Luckily for us, we live at a place where we can drive back. I truly sympathize with those who live far away who cannot take the option I had, who had to be at the hotel’s mercy. I noted many others waiting for their rooms too.........",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

51,5.0,"Aloft wasn't on my radar everytime I looked for hotels around KL, but recently I decided to give it a try.And oh boy, how could I missed this property all these time.The location couldn't be more perfect as it's located on the most accessible address in town. And the facilities were excellent, but it was the people (talents, as they like to call) that's the actual star of Aloft.Yes, it has got nice rooms and beautiful swimming pool and what not. But nothing beats the welcoming feel of the human touch (no pun intended during this period of time). Every corner of the property, you will be greeted by the friendly and cheerful staff.I guess the ""vision of W hotels"" really works.If I was to be nitpicking, maybe the crispy and rock-hard garlic cheese naan for breakfast could be more fluffy instead.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

Access to Nu Sentral mall also makes it super easy to kill time.The infinity swimming pool has nice views and remains warm despite the rainy days.The rooms are quite clean, and really appreciate the individually sealed salt and pepper and cups for extra precaution.  Although not all items are sealed, but compared to the recent few hotels that I have stayed during the MCO, Aloft has the best practice.  Even the buffet breakfast was carefully planned to optimize social distancing.  The staff at the Buffet is top notch in hospitality, smiling faces and eager to serve.The room service also delivers quality without overcharging.  Love their warmer carts which keeps the food warm from kitchen to room.We felt that the hotel is out to impress, and will definitely be going back for more wonderful pampering.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

Nothing to say about the hotel or room, everything was good, nice and tidy.Something weird I would like to share about this stay and hope the hotel's General Manager Ms. Rubel can give me an answer at here.1. I am booking the room by using Club Marriott membership, but the front desk didn't validate the membership card, does it means anyone can enjoy the Club Marriott's rate without the membership?2. I am expecting some welcome gift as stated in the room rate, and there is a pack of cookies on the table together with a card written by Ms. Rubel when I get into my room. However, the card is not for me, is for another Titanium member. I am quite confusing whether the front desk is giving a wrong room or the welcome gifts was put in the wrong room.

64,3.0,"I used to stay at Aloft KL whenever I go to KL for a short holiday.Surprisingly, this is the first time we were disappointed with this hotel.We arrived at the hotel for check in and we must say that the lobby looked like a dead place. They turn off most of the lights and there was no music as well. We truly understand that post-covid19 travels might affect hotel industry and they want to cut cost but playing some music in the lobby wont hurt! At least give us some positive welcoming vibes.Room was great. But after staying at one of the hotels in the same area, their safety precautions for post-covid19 travels were not that great. Door was sealed for security reason which indicates that no one has entered your room since it was last sanitised. But surprisingly whenever you open the door, it wont break the seal which made us think that the door seal was unreliable.Towels, bathrobe and slippers are placed and hanged normally. They didn’t put them in a sealed plastic casing or boxes.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

Noisy aircon, but this helped to disguise the neighbour noise (slamming doors etc). Functional bathroom with shower but no bath. Comfortable king size bed. Good views over KL. Small but decent pool on the 30th floor (didn't actually use it though). Friendly staff. Reasonably priced room service. We were able to negotiate a late checkout which was helpful. Both checkin and checkout took a long time as the hotel was very busy. Convenient location right next to KL Sentral. Overall a very good value for money choice.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

It’s my third or fourth stay here and my usual choice when I’m doing a long stay here or for my staff’s visitNot your usual 5-6 star hotel, but everything is worthy. The front desk, housekeeping, security, in room dining/kitchen team have been so helpful and accommodating. And yes the GM Rubel calls you to check if you’re doing alright and updates on the latest progress. Utmost gratitude to the housekeeping team as they have been really patient and ready any time to get the room cleaned. So as the in room dining team/kitchen for my daily breakfast requests, my late hours supper, and also for remembering my tub of ice cubes every morning without requesting, very good personal touchThe pool, gym and all areas have been closed and the team was really helpful in granting me a workout mat from the gym to be sent to my room. To Rubel, thanks for your understanding the importance of exercising and finding ways to help me fulfil that !Just on a minor side, some rooms are not very sound proof, could hear sound of water running the toilet while walking pass the corridor but this is the way the hotel it’s constructed and built, something out of bound for the management teamThe personal touch has also been very good for a 3.5-4 star hotel, far more than what you’re expecting.  Not paying the price for Regis, Ritz, W, JW or autographs collections so no complains at allOnly I had a cake sent to me on my birthday from a friend on the night of 20/3. It is still kept in the storage freezer. Would be great if the front desk staff or manager on duty that night to be curious about a birthday cake sent to a hotel. A small wish or a small note would be an icing on the cake for the entire stayThe movement restriction has been extended to another further two weeks. Guess I’ll be staying here for a month.

I really enjoyed speaking with him.",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5
74,5.0,"The most upperhand element of this hotel is definitely the location. It is stratigically located within the iconic transportation hub of Kuala Lumpur, The KL central. Since it is directly accessible by the airport rail link, it makes the connection to the airport like a stone throw. There are a few famous hotel brands within this area like Hilton and Le-Meriden that can rival this hotel but what stands out the most is its immediate access to the the bustling shopping complex, NU-central. There is a direct entrance from the Hotel which makes strolling around this place so easy. However please be informed that the direct entrance to the shopping complex closes at 12 midnight. So, if you miss the boat, you have to walk up the open street to the main lobby entrance which I don't really fancy doing it at that hour.The room was comfortable and relatively spacious. There is enough space from the bed to the windows in the sense your children can run around or roll on the carpet. Not alike some other hotels where you get bumper to bumper  among your troop.  There is a cozy working station at the edge and the bathroom was great. There is no bathtub though, but I don’t mind that cause I’m not a bathtub person. There is a small fridge that is kept empty but it does make sense not to fill it because when it comes to food, the world is your oyster the moment you hit the shopping complex The pool has a view to die for when you immerse at the city skyline in the infinity pool. The pool can get a bit crowded in the evening and I got to say for such a big hotel it can’t cater for the crowd. You will find yourself without any chairs to sit on. The gym is also located many floors away from the pool so you  can’t really take a dip after your workouts. If you are a fan of sauna and steam bath, you can forget about it at this hotel.On the whole it is still a great experience to stay here and I will surely recommend it be it for business or pleasure ",Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral Hotel,4.5

I told her that I would like to order a birthday cake for my sister and give her a surprise etc... and after hearing from me, Ms. Afrina told me that she could arrange the cake on complimentary basis PLUS she could also arrange some simple decoration in the room. As if I didn’t give her enough problem, I told her that my sister will arrive earlier than me. In that case my sister will get the surprise but without me around and it defeat the purpose. I then asked if that could be done when we are out for dinner and without any hesitation Ms. Afrina said yes!! How lovely can that be? And upon arrival, Mr. Aruwin also reminded me on the special arrangement for my sister. Everything was perfect and my sister really had a surprise when she returned to her room after our dinner. As for me, Rachel wrote me a welcome note plus a little souvenir placed in my room. She even bothered to count the number of times I have stayed at Aloft Sentral.

There is a fridge, but you have to purchase the content if you want at the bar downstairs. The room lighting should be made a bit brighter as usually I need to prepare some materials for the meeting. The only working area that is well lit is the working table using a desk lamp. There is no night lamp so if you can’t sleep in total darkness you may need to light up the bathroom and leave the door ajar. The desk lamp brightness is fixed.

Dear Ruma team,You’ve proven to us that the “Hostmanship” is not just a marketing tagline on your website, and we’ve experience how serious you guys are with it.We are very much impressed, and this will definitely not be the last time we are staying at the RUMA.","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0
2,5.0,My room was upgraded to deluxe suite for free and I was surprised the hotel even decorate some balloons & dessert in my room. The parking is also free and all the mini bars are also freeee. But the main reason I chose this hotel is bcs they offer the 24hours check in & check  ! Major love for this hotel. Will visit again soon,"The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

8,5.0,"I had a really pleasant stay with the ruma. They upgraded my room and provided flexi checkin/checkout which i ended up checking out late at night. Fikri from reception was very helpful & nice to me the entire stay. I wanted to extend my stay however it was a busy weekend, they were booked out. Sulaiman from housekeeping did a good job providing fast service as i requested some amenities. Breakfast in bed was superb especially now as i did not want to be around people at the restaurant. would definitely come again soon","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0
9,1.0,"I was at the Ruma on 10-11/4/2021 and I have booked a corner room for my weekend staycation.It was a splendid registration as I checked in early on 10/4 at 0030. Decoration is super glam!The frontdesk person greeted me  in Malay and I am definitely liking it!The room, however....There were corners especially at the bedside that were not cleaned, dusty.The pillows are light feather soft pillows. I dislike it because I did not get enough sleep from it.There is only 1 bin for a medium room. 1 small bin.The tub was just nice. It looks like everything cramps up in a small space.The next morning I requested for a room make up.Little that I know, that I was DENIED to request room make up as I stay for 1 day only, and was advised not to request room make up on the last day of stay.Fastforward to the last day of stay,Breakfast in Atas restaurant is definitely an absurd experience.Queueing up for at least 15 minutes before I was brought to my table. The usage of plastic gloves defeats the purpose of being hygienic.The food spread was just ok but it could have been better.Smoked salmon ( the cut was too thick and tasted salty)There were various types of kuehs and breads, but I am disappointed with the selection of Malay kueh. Seri muka is slightly hard on the pandan part.I took nasi lemak, and it did not wowed me.I ordered egg benedict and again I am gravely disappointed with the dish. The muffin was burnt, the egg yolk was not fluidly came out as the name suggested. Might probably change the name to sunny side up egg.The waffle was another dish that I would no recommend; it was as hard as stone.Amenities wise.Gym was a pleasantly nice. Not too many occupants which is fine.Infinity pool is full with kids and families, which I truly understand.Checking out was really smooth. The frontdesk staff were helpful.Anyway, this is probably the first and the last time I’ll check in the Ruma unless it has improved its services.A 5 star hotel? Questionable indeed.","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0
11,5.0,"Went here for a 1-night staycation and it was amazing. I would say their 24hr flexi check in/out time is what attracted me the most on top of other great facilities/services. I checked-in at 8am & checked-out at 11pm the next day (how crazy is that?! Haha I’m not sure if there is other place that offers this). The breakfast buffet offers quite wide variety western menu (eg. eggs benedict, raw salmon, big breakfast etc) on top of other basic breakfast buffet menu. The gym & swimming pool are great as well. The bar looks cool & its such a vibe to chill. Didn’t have a chance to try their other facilities like spa, meal room service or dinner restaurant but would recommend to try it out!","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

14,3.0,"It is wonderful stepping into the hotel with it's tranquil walk into the beautiful lobby, it's an oasis in the middle of the city (strategically located about 10mins walk to KLCC and shorter stroll to Pavillion). Checking in was a breeze with friendly assistance. However, no one offered to take my bags up to my room (a single lady carrying 4 different bags) and they were not even really busy at the time i was checking in. But the excitement to see my room made me forget the strain on my shoulders.And what a sight it was walking to my corner studio, as the shutters automatically goes up while keep admiring the simple lines which are clean yet tasteful. i particularly big fan of the rose gold wash basin and the bath tub which i soaked myself every night. Room came with a breakfast which i was excited to try (heard a lof about Atas restaurant, surely the breakfast would be great too) oh boy was i dissapointed, there was a buffet with limited choices and a menu whihc you could order mains that you would like. Aside to the fact that no one came to take my order for the mains, everything at the buffet was below everage and frankly disppointing. You should never get nasi lemak wrong at a malaysian hotel. And for dinner one night i had nasi goireng at Santai and it was very bland and to my horror had bean sprouts in it. However, the horror did'nt last too long as staff at Santai were very friendly and accomodating and made me feel very welcomed.Overall a very comfortable stay, loved the feel of the hotel, so pleasing to the eyes and very comfortable stay however slightly scarred from the food there, hope they could improve it in the future.","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

We were also entertained by Bell and Khai who lived up to the hostmanship as promised by The Ruma.We totally love the environment and the crowd is well managed. All following SOP and not overcrowding during our visit. However we would like to sincerely ask the chef to relook on their choice of pastries / desserts menu served as some of the food has really odd/weird/unusual pairing of ingredients (November's afternoon tea - the blue theme was wayyyy better than this round's menu). Although we truly understand the specialty of menu but making delicate and delicious food compliment your environment even more.Last but not least, we were also been greet warmly by Adi and Vincent which I believe is from ATAS Restaurant.

All drawers were filled with useful condiments, cutleries, small plates, 3 types of glasses, etc. No drawers and furniture left emptied.4. Complimentary mini bar - soft drinks, more than 2 bottles of mineral water, tidbits (muruku, mini dodol & kacang tumbuk) --- so traditional!5.

She paid for the delivery (because it wouldn’t accept cash payment) and refused to allow me to bank in for her. I am amazed how great the staffs are and even personal whereby they treat you like family. ,"The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

Its a prime location if you want to stay in the city, we only travel on foot because everything is close by, roughly 6-8 mins walk to KLCC or Pavilion. Btw, you would definitely enjoy the breakfast, we certainly did! My son loved the pandan pancake so much, i had to remake it at home. Hehe. Thank you Ruma! It was such a pleasant stay!!","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0
71,5.0,"Made arrangements with RuMa via Agoda for our 5th wedding anniversary staycation. Agoda coordinated with RuMa accordingly via emails and the service was excellent even before we checked in. Was gladly pleased with some of the generous VIP upgrades for tea time meals and the mini bar. The room was so beautiful and the staff decorated it with rose petals for the occasion. Housekeeping even responded very fast at 1am and two staff came just to deliver a stiffer pillow! The whole hotel was an artful delight for the senses and grammable pictures. We also had our scrumptious fine dining at The Atas restaurant and was superbly attended by Deva, and again by him at breakfast. Outstanding service! Felt like we were in a 6-7 star hotel. Amazing experience all the way right til check out. Definitely worth the experience, quality and hospitality despite the slightly higher prices than nearby alternatives. Thank you for making our anniversary so memorable. We will be back again. :)","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

79,3.0,"We stayed for one night here during new year’s (prior to that we stayed at The Majestic for 2 nights and had exceptional service). The hotel came highly recommended by a friend. They have the option whether to have breakfast in the room or at Atas. We choose the latter. It took an hour or so for our breakfast to arrive and it was just mine. Not even my husband’s! After waiting for so long (and we had a restless toddler with us), we told them to just send the food to our room to which they said they can’t do so but can pack it for us. Our child wanted to swim at it was already 10.30am (we were there since 9am!) but I waited while my husband went to the pool with our child. So once they packed the food, I went to my room. Opened it and saw that there’s no toast, milk, or cereal from our breakfast set. Called them and they said they will send it up. After 1 bloody hour of waiting..nothing came to us. Even after we check out. I was too pissed and tired to complain. We even asked for a bucket of ice, 2 hrs before check out and it never came either. Very disappointed.

Thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Atas Restaurant.

85,5.0,"This is definitely one of the best 5 star hotels in KL. It feels homey, cosy and intimate. The rooms are spacious and I love the their bathtub. The staffs are fabulous. I have been to almost all 5 star hotels in KL, and I find that the staffs at the RUMA are the most sincere yet they are very  professional. I had meals at ATAS and SANTAI and the food was fabulous. I didn’t use the gymnasium but the infinity pool is gorgeous. In my opinion, this is the best pool in KL 5 star properties. The hotel is merely 5 mins walk from Pavilion and 10 mins walk from the Petronas Twin Towers. This hotel certainly offers value for money. I’ll be back.

86,5.0,"This was my first return stay at the Ruma Hotel after its reopening since the MCO was lifted.Everything remains great and it’s impressive how they keep up to such high quality of service and hotel conditions after the MCO and CMCO. The Ruma Hotel has also put in notable efforts to safeguard the guests’ safety and well-being by implementing strict protective measures in regard to the virus. I am particularly impressed with the proper disinfection done on all the luggages upon the guests’ arrival at the hotel entrance.This was my birthday staycation and the hotel has also decorated my room for me, and left me a sweet note with a beautiful cake. Appreciate it.Overall it’s an enjoyable and awesome experience.I would also like to extend my gratitude specially to Mr Sebastian from reservation department who has made perfect arrangements to accommodate my needs for the stay.

The only thing that the hotel may need to improve perhaps is the water pressure in the bathroom, not really stable though. Other than this, PERFECT!","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0
94,5.0,"PrologueShould we forget the right advice to book a corner unit by LIZA? Should we not remember the warm welcome and genuine smile during reception and room introduction by EZAZ? how can we erase the memory of the wonderful decorative touches and mini-gift by SYDNEY? What about that ""ayam curry"" prepared by my wife & SUHAIMI?OverviewAs a couple, we were celebrating the beginning of a new life together. It was my wife's first trip to KL, and for this reason she deserves only the best. It took me a tremendous effort to decide where we're going to stay.  We were among the lucky few who stayed at this place during its early opening late Feb 2019. We stayed in a Corner Studio unit for four nights. The RuMa is a unique concept which literally translates to ""The HoMe"". Aesthetically pleasing and tastefully decorated with a blend of simple artistic and modern elements, the RuMa exceeded our expectations in every aspect: location, accommodation, service and dining. It’s noteworthy that while we visited, some facilities such as spa were not operating or have not opened yet but we have been informed about that.Booking & Arrival Experience (5/5)As I was searching for certain features required in our accommodation, I directly engaged with the RuMa team online. My enquiry was swiftly answered. My booking was facilitated by reservation team manager Mrs. Liza who offered an incredible advice to book a corner studio with tower view rather than deluxe room. Timely and prompt communication by the hotel gave a first good signal of an exceptional service that followed later. Arriving at 6 AM after medium-haul flight, our arrival couldn’t have been better. Thanks to RHR 24-hour guaranteed stay policy we didn’t worry about paying extra for an early check-in or having no vacant room until noon. A very friendly porter (can’t call his good name but he was semi-bald) was waiting at hotel entrance and assisted us by opening vehicle doors and picking up our luggage.An ultra-luxurious lobby with a fragrant scent caught our senses and made that drowsy post-flight feeling go away.  Mr. Ezaz from front-desk finalized our check-in while we were seated and some drinks were served. He passionately welcomed and briefed us about the hotel, its facilities and took us to the room for a short introduction.Room (5/5)Blending high-tech with an artistic design, the corner studio offered a direct view on the twin towers. Spacious yet super clean and functional.The double bed was comfortable. Just beside the bed, lie the buttons which control curtains and lights. A complimentary mini-bar and branded coffee/tea kits were replenished daily.The bathroom is split into three separate areas. A shower area with a nice bathtub, a washing sink area with a functional wardrobe and a toilet area. This separation is intuitive, time-saving and is gaining popularity among many new hotels globally as if one person is using the toilet, the other could be using the shower.On 2nd night of our stay, we were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful room set-up by Mrs. Sydney. A small floral gift, a hand-written letter and decorative balloons around the bed made the night special.The studio felt very relaxing and pampering and is a pure manifestation of “the RuMa” concept. Facilities (5/5)I had the pleasure of using the lovely mini-gym located next to the pool. Equipped with a few but state-of-the-art machinery, I really enjoyed exercising on a treadmill.We regret not being able to receive treatments at UR spa as it has not been officially opened at the time but hopefully we should enjoy that in the future.Restaurant (5/5)The concept of fine-dining is clearly demonstrated by ATAS restaurant. This is noticed by our breakfast experiences at both the restaurant and in-room dining. The in-room breakfast came exactly at the requested time and according to our choices. An immense effort is put into food presentation. Each plate was visually appealing. The taste of the meal indicates that only the finest ingredients were sourced. Part of our daily KL morning rituals was having breakfast at ATAS. Staff greeting upon our entry and seating accompanied by smile and willingness to serve is another service quality we testify to. The limited but healthy and fresh selection of food in the morning buffet was our daily fuel to explore the city.To indulge in an out-of-box culinary experience, my wife thought of getting into a cooking class at ATAS kitchen. That’s when we met with chef Tony and chef Suhaimi to make a plan for the class several days ahead. We were asked about our preference and type of meal and we chose a lunch in the afternoon. Two days forward, we were contacted and everything was set and ready for class to take place. My wife, aided with chef Suhaimi, went to prepare one of the most delicious meals we had while in Malaysia, it was an Asian chicken curry dish with a side salad. During the class: the recipe, ingredients and preparation method was fully explained and my wife participated in each step and enjoyed the experience to the fullest. The outcome was savory and flavor-rich meal that she can now prepare at home with passion and wonderful memory. Bravo ATAS team!Departure Experience (5/5)For every story, there will always be an end. For the joy and comfort we felt in this place, it was hard to leave and say goodbye. So on our last day at the RuMa, we contacted the service desk to inform them we’re leaving at our designated check-out time. At front-desk, there was no crowd and I had the pleasure of meeting with duty manager Mr. Jaya. We shook hands and I thanked him for the exceptional service. I told him we should definitely come back to the “HoMe”. Finally, the airport cab arrived and our bags were loaded into the cab by porter who wished us a farewell.  Overall Value and Final Word (5/5)The level of hospitality we have received from the RuMa is unprecedented. I simply can’t fault this place. This shows that my verdict is a bit clouded by my emotional experience but I do find that the RuMa was a very valuable investment for our lifelong memory. As I am a detail-oriented person, I can easily relate to the RuMa where very fine & particular details are looked after. The highly personalized and customized service distinguished this place from others in the bustling city of KL and this might be a reason why it’s costly. The perfect staying experience in my newlywed life.We would like to extend our appreciation and thanks to every energetic member of the RuMa family including management and service staff for making our stay unforgettable.Mohammad & Rinad.","The RuMa Hotel and Residences, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

She checked me in personally. Being a first timer at this hotel, there was so much to explore. First, being escorted to the designated room, it was being upgraded due to Accor status. Next, Emily See whom I have known from previous hotel stay remembered my personal request. Chilled sparkling water and whatnots awaited. I couldn't been any happier.Moving on, as a platinum member, I availed myself for free flow of freebies such as sparkling water, chill water, aerated drinks and juices, coffee and tea. The selection was fabulous. U could even ask for coffee with almond milk, good for those who adhere to strict dietary requirements.I had lunch, a seafood platter. Called the Dulang Grill. Was happy with 50% off from the price sold. It was a great set lunch with grilled stuff n pasta. A bit salty to my liking. Nevertheless, I enjoyed thoroughly.Evening cocktail was served. Delectable nibbles were presented in a few tiffin boxes which resembles some nostalgia. Food was good. I requested for a cheese platter as well as satay. The lamb satay was to die for. Not only that, I devoured the red. It was house pour but premium. To end the meal, I relished on the choc - coated dessert. It was heavenly. Bob who was the server and his supervisor Raziff as well as Maiden and all the staff at Courtyard did a fantastic job. Saci and female Manageress, Ms Olivia were equally attentive. Breakfast was good. I received a birthday cake with the team coming forward to present a birthday song. I felt somewhat a little awkward but touched. After  leaving, I left my pair of trainers in the room. EMILY who knew I was in the vicinity sent to me personally. I thought such gesture was priceless. Thank you Pavilion hotel n staff.

The staffs are all extremely friendly and make you feel very welcome the moment you step out from the lift at the lobby. Great job on that because not every hotel does this as well as you. I booked a urban king room but was upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise. The room is big and comfortable as always. The club lounge is currently closed but we still can go to the courtyard restaurant for our drinks and evening cocktail. So that is not a big issue.

21,5.0,"We stayed at the hotel to usher in the new year. I thought we made an excellent decision to try out the Pavilion Hotel for the first time. The hotel is located adjacent to the Mall, making our shopping and dining experience a convenient and happy one. The reservation experience was great - a shout out to Roshidi, the Club Lounge Manager and his team. They managed our multiple reservations well - even calling us a couple of days before our stay to explain to us the parking process etc. They also managed to have all our rooms on the same floor - my mom was happy to know that her grand daughters were all safely nearby. Housekeeping staff were extremely friendly despite the very busy time of the year. Breakfast was excellent (on the first day) but we were not too excited for the second day as we had to go to the ballroom - some of my family members thought the choices were limited on the second day. But despite this, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.",Pavilion Hotel Kuala Lumpur Managed by Banyan Tree,4.5

I was allowed early check in at 1pm, so grateful as we can settle down in the room with the kids before heading out for lunch. Check in was quick and straightforward. Your keycard is needed to head to your floor so good additional security there. I had a corner room, so it was much larger and will fit a baby cot well (was also provided by the hotel as I requested online). The room is very well lit, good amenities, and clean. Like they have capsule coffee instead of the normal instant coffee. A free pack of face mask is also provided. Good to have extra during these times. In general, this hotel is very good, due to the fact that it is connected to the best mall in KL, Pavilion Mall, which has everything under one roof. It is also quite well located, with a dedicated walkway from Pavilion mall to KLCC. The surrounding areas have lots of amenities. There are free GoKL bus services nearby and also the tourist hop on hop off bus stop nearby as well.

And of course I’ve slept well. Day 2 Breakfast! The most important meal of the day, every time if I were to stay in a hotel I would make sure that I would try their breakfast menu. But before that a quick workout at the gym, let me tell you their gym is niceeee, they call it their Sky Gym which speaks for itself. Fully equip, easy to use for everyone’s daily workout. Hi and thanks to Rahmat for assisting me to change the soundtrack in the gym to motivate me. Back to breakfast, when I arrived I was greeted warmly by Esca as she escorted me to my table. The waiters there were very accommodating, asking me how was my stay and etc. Thanks to Ridwan, Sharma, for attending to my meal preferences and Ukasyah, Maideen and Raziq as well. As you can see from the photos, I had a big meal and I left the Courtyard with a happy tummy. I even brought my parents to have breakfast with me there the next day. When leaving the Courtyard, I was greeted by Syann and Juhairi. They have such pleasing personalities, had a quick chat with them as well. I was lucky that I got to meet Remco and Azizan, surprised that they know my name and that if I needed anything to just let them know.

93,5.0,"This was not our first staycation but it was our first time-off together post Malaysian’s Movement Control Order and hence the chance to experience the usually not-in-our-budget-kind-of-hotel. The reason we decided on this hotel was because it was one of the top-ranking hotels in Kuala Lumpur that is connected to a shopping mall.The hotel was listed as a 5-star hotel and they proved that to us even before we checked in. Upon finishing the online booking for the hotel, we received a few emails from the hotel inquiring us about things that we expected from them for our stay and information that they could utilize to treat us better during the staycation.Parking is available as both basement and valet service. As for the basement parking, the entrance is just a little bit further from the lobby and shared with the mall parking entrance. There would be a 2nd boom gate separating the hotel parking and the mall parking and it could be accessed by simply inserting the parking ticket into the machine which would be returned immediately upon checking.The concierge is multiple levels up and we needed to take the elevator there, after scanning the QR code for covid-19 registration and temperature scanning.My family and I arrived at around 12.30 PM on a Monday at the concierge and we queried whether an early check-in was possible which was granted by the nice lady at the registration counter. The lobby is a thing of beauty with high ceiling and a few views of the city since it is a few floors up. There was nobody queuing at that time and checking in was fast. Our request for a higher floors room near the elevator was granted.The hotel went an extra mile by preparing the room to welcome my wife who was 6-month pregnant at the time. There were balloons, welcoming wish on the bed headboard, brownies as well as welcoming card.We requested a praying mat via the room phone and soon enough it was brought to our room nicely wrapped in a plastic. An extra towel that we requested also was provided in the same manner.Since there were Standard Operating Procedures in place, breakfast was not provided in the normal buffet style but instead, each individual would be able to choose 4 type of meals, so for us three, we were granted 12 choices of meals. Well, we only managed to appreciate 6-7 of them before surrendering to the fullness of our belly.There is a direct link to the Pavilion shopping mall. It saved us from having to walk in the sun / rain and traffic to reach the mall.In general, it was an enjoyable stay and hopefully we will be able to go there again.POSITIVES:# early check in, late check out# reserved parking spots for hotel guests # request during reservation was given# very nice & clean room# fast room service# good location# strong and fast Wi-Fi signal# rain shower# light and easy to use iron (emberton)# weight measuring device providedNEGATIVES:# no magnet at main door to hold it in place while bringing luggage in# toilet is a bit claustrophobic – no windows (maybe can hang pictures / posters)# poor mobile signal (digi)",Pavilion Hotel Kuala Lumpur Managed by Banyan Tree,4.5

The eggs benedict was not to my liking as there was not enough of runny hollandaise sauce to go round the whole muffin.

The additional decor and special dessert provided made my friend’s stay so much better.The rooms that we stayed in was amazing, facilities were great and the bathroom was wonderful. I just did not enjoy having the shower so close to the door, but that’s just a personal preference. The bathtub was divine and it’s one of the only few hotels with bathtubs with a view. I also took the opportunity to have a massage and it was one of the best I’ve experienced.

Easy access.During arrival, we were served some kind of sparkling water or infused water.We had a staff greeting us and accompanying us to the rooms. We were attended to personally very well.The room were very nicely decorated and very homey yet luxury feeling. The only downside was not getting the klcc view as it would have made our trip much more memorable.We only had a one night stay but yet their service doesn't diminish.

Separate bidet toilet flows into wardrobe, powder room n lastly rain shower n bathtub area. A very big size bathtub !- When I checked in, the welcoming officer (Chloe) brought me a tour of the room and explained the features i.e. what switch to turn on/off, how to use the coffee maker, explained different functions of rain shower etc.- Another feature that I like is their turndown service. At 6pm there will be housekeeping staff came to the room, light up the aromatherapy diffuser (they hv different scent each day) n put the chocolates & souvenirs at bedside. - The hotel building also has its own private bridge to Pavilion mall.

98,4.0,"The check in and arrangements done before arrival was attended to promptly and efficiently,  and the front desk ppl were really helpful and friendly. Everyone was really nice and the room looked great.  there were minor hiccups, housekeeping the next day was a bit sloppy and there seem to be a lack of  follow through with some of the staff during breakfast as in forgotten orders etc.  But the staff was really apologetic and it made me felt heard. But i am ok with most of that except for the reservation screw up that was made at Vertigo's. My reservation was cancelled despite being booked 2 days earlier in favour of walk-in guests. My family managed to get a table after much arguing but we only had an hour to be there as were not told of the closing time. So that was a fun birthday :( But other than that, the spa was great, as were the staff, Naz in the spa, some of the front desk people who checked me in and assisted me the next day as well as the supervisor during  breakfast on the 28th.

Room was very spacious n cosy, with a great view. Bed was very comfortable. They even provide a baby cot free of charge. Hotel staff was very courteous.A few downsides :1. late check in because our room was not ready by the time we got there at 4pm (check in time was at 3pm). Only got our room at 5pm. A simple call from the hotel to inform us of the late check in wouldve made a world of difference. 2. Room was not very clean. I expected the room to be spotless with all the sanitising due to covid. However we found traces of food around the room (under the couch, behind curtains). 3.

Most of them were waiting for their rooms to be ready. Luckily, our room was ready and just took 10 minutes for the checked in process and entertained by Ms Sofia. She is very nice and helpful in giving information. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. Our room at level 14 was facing swimming pool and other 5-star hotels. It was great view indeed. Thank you, MO.After checked in, we had our afternoon tea at Lounge at the Park and entertained by a pregnant staff. She is very nice and helpful. However, I requested to change to other table that can be occupied by myself, my mom and my 5-year old daughter, even though i made a reservation for two. Hey, there was many table available for 3, what?Because one of the male staff insisted to change to other table, maybe because they need to set back the table. His body gesture shows everything even we couldnt see his face expression. At last we got the table but i still felt unwelcoming and he really ruins my mood until the end of the tea session. Later, we had our room service dinner in the room since my mom wanted to spend more time in the room. The food was delicious and good. I think it suits the price. Next day, we had our buffet breakfast at mosaic around 7.30am. One of the staff brought us to the table, however the table is not stable. So requested her to stablize the table. We waited her about 5 minutes but she didnt turned up. Finally, there were a male staff helped us to stablize the table. That female lady also had ruined my mood this morning. Luckily, the food helped me calm down. I think most of the restaurant staff need to have PR trainings in order to improve the services. What can i say positive feedback about MO is the room.

6,1.0,"Hi MO team, firstly thank you for having my family and I over the weekend 27 Mar - 29 Mar 2021. I am not one who would normally provide negative feedback and this is the first time that I felt compelled to. Please see below in chronological order:1. we checked in very late on 27 Mar and I had sent an email and facebook messenger to your team - no feedback/acknowledgement2. upon arrival at 22:30, the porter was helping us with our luggage. When i said i'll carry my own laptop, the porter commented, ""ok up to you"" in a very sarcastic tone, which I totally did not appreciate, but I left it and gave him the benefit of the doubt that he didn't mean it3. When i did my booking a couple of weeks before check-in, I requested for 2 rooms to be close to one another as my parents may require assistance - we were put on different floors4. I requested one bed in Room 1, and twin beds in Room 2 - I was given one bed in each room. Normally I would let it go but was too tired to change rooms and had to share a bed with my helper.5. On Sunday 28 Mar, when my family and I went down for breakfast in Mosaic, the staff said the rooms I booked had no breakfast included - I checked my app in Booking.com and it had. Nevertheless, they allowed us in6. On Monday 29 Mar, when we went down to Mosaic for breakfast, one extremely rude staff (at the coffee station) snapped at me by saying, ""no not yours"" when I asked if the coffee on the counter was mine. I asked him to make another because I ordered it 10 mins ago, he didn't acknowledge nor reply. Soon after he came to my table and instead of placing the hot coffee gently on the table, he forcedly placed it on with a soft thud. A few minutes went by and my dad ordered another coffee. He came with a sour face and placed it on our table with enough force. Nevertheless, my dad thanked him and he walked away without saying anything. What kind of service or staff are you hiring?7. It's been two days since I checked out and I still have not received my receipt via email (I told the staff I did not need a hardcopy, so just email was fine).The only positive experience I had in my 2 days was when Yenny (the night manager) helped me to print my boarding pass. Other than that, I must say, for a luxury 5-star hotel like MO, our stay was disappointing. We are not the type who would raise a complaint at every minor thing but honestly, my family and I had had better service in a 3-star hotel elsewhere.

Prior to check in, I made a request that the hotel assist me with a pool side ""surprise"" birthday dinner arrangement. However due to MCO, they could not agree to my request and suggested in room dinner instead. It was disheartening as in room would be boring i thought. But I agreed to make the best of the situation and said yes to the room dinner arrangements. As we were checking in on his birthday, I made all prior arrangements for the cake and gifts to be delivered to the hotel directly and all deliveries were well coordinated and managed by hotel staff plus they were discreet about the surprise.I took my husband for a stroll to the pool side at 6.30pm and when we got back to the room by 7pm, the staff had already laid out our dinner and gifts table in a splendid manner! My husband was pleasantly surprised to see the arrangements put up by the hotel staff.From the bottom of my heart, I thank the team at Mandarin Oriental for making his birthday memorable. We will certainly come back for many more stays with you.You exceeded my expectations! And the food at your hotel is amazing in Taste and quality. Plus the SOP for Covid prevention has been managed so well. All your employees have made us feel so welcomed and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

Just hope your team will be able to improve room cleanliness especially dust on rack and stains bedsheets otherwise toilet hygiene is acceptable. Customer services been very up to standard and helpful. They helped us to extend our check out hour. ,"Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
21,4.0,"We had a special occasion there and they promised room deco upon arrival. There was none when we arrived, told them and they quickly sent some chocolates over. That was nice. Toiletries came in one set only, probably forgotten to replenish after previous guest checked out. This, they acted quickly too and send another set over.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
22,3.0,"Incident of unwelcoming of our presence at your pool really spoilt our staycation. After long argument with manager in charge about the blunt and ironic procedure, we giving up on their response and left the amenity. Repeating asked about our room number make my companion feels uncomfortable and not welcoming response. Feel we are trespasser. Their hospitality treatment and the way they're resolve the issue is disappointment. Attitude on our complaint post the incident was bad too. Even during check out, this issue seem was cover up and doesn't address by reception. No proper manner apologizing received. Avoid using their escalator lobby at carpark basement because is dingy. Feel enter the redundant property. The ground lobby layout arrangement a bit puzzled for guest and not well coordinate. Pre arrival in hotel services however are spot on, the staff noted about our request such birthday treats and early check in.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
23,5.0,"Our first time at the Mandarin Oriental KL. And surely not our last. Beyond the unrivalled Christmas lunch spread, elegant marble finishings & awesome bathtub; we were most blown away by the wonderful & warm staff. Special mentions to Valai at Mosaic, Tajul at the pool, Hafiz at the Mandarin Grill as well as Zarrul & our friend from Sungai Besar at the bar (sorry if we mis-spelled your names). Spending Christmas at this fine & proudly Malaysian-owned establishment was one of the best decisions we made in 2020.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
24,4.0,"I choose this hotel because of the location and Twin Towers view. I was at MO for 02 nights from 22-24 DEC and stayed at room 2318.I was not greeted upon entry into the hotel entrance. No one is asking to assist with my luggage until I have finished checked in, one of the bell man offered to bring my luggage to the room. Mattress was average  and the room lacks some usual amenities one would expect from a luxury hotel. Service however was spot on and the staffs acted swiftly upon request. I ordered a piece of cheese cake but this is the worst cheese cake I have ever had !!! Breakfast was okay but on my 2nd day, the dim sum was served without the sweet soy sauce but only serve with hot sauce ?  Too bad...My children enjoyed the pool. Pool was okay but smaller than Grand Hyatt. Thanks to the life guard (can't remember his name). He took care of my children when i was away for a while.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
25,1.0,"I specifically chose to stay in this hotel during Xmas staycation because it has an outdoor jacuzzi overlooking the twin towers. Not only this facility was taken away but when I resort to the indoor jacuzzi, I was turn away by the staff THRICE. First time was that I was not allowed to bring my 5yo son with me. Second time it was said that the jacuzzi needed booking at the reception desk. Third time when I arrived at the desk, receptionist told me jacuzzi doesn't need booking. BUT it is closing at 9pm instead of the usual 10pm and on top of that they needed extra 15 mins to sanitize the pool before the close it. I was wondering in the pre-covid times when they close at 10pm, wouldn't they need to sanitize and close it as well? Now that you have additional 1 hour, couldn't they sanitize post 9pm?I just needed that hot water jacuzzi to wrap up my long day. Nothing wellness about this kind of service especially they eye my loose clothing and kept turning me away from using the facility. Deeply disappointed at this trip's experience as I have love my previous 2 trips. ","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
26,3.0,"was not greeted upon entry into the hotel from the car park. car park is old and very dim - upgrade is required. long check in queue but will not put the blame on the hotel as it was festive season, no fan of MO perks were offered as well. room is dated with torn bedsheet and bathrobe. mattress was average at best and the room lacks some usual amenities one would expect from a 5* hotel. service however was spot on and the staffs acted swiftly upon requests being made. ","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
27,2.0,"MO is still using spring mattresses topped with a layer of mattress topper, couldn’t sleep well. Bed sheet was torn and bath robe as well.Overall old, no coffee machine, no shavers (normally I don’t use those provided by hotels but I have forgotten to bring mine ) Mini bar empty like 2-stars hotel. As a fans of MO member, I couldn’t choose any privilege as website described, the best given was late check out at 1pm. I couldn’t find a reason to come back. There are too many competitors with wow factors such as theirs amenities, facilities and well designed rooms. And yes, turn down service was truly disappointing. Not what I used to get in others 5-stars hotel. Great coffee and breakfast. ","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
28,4.0,"Going towards the end of 2020, i dont think i'll hop into another hotel again. Hence, i would conclude my stay at MO is my best hotel experience for this challenging year.In term of spaciousness of the room, i've seen better and the room we booked this time was just okay but still quite roomy.The room and the bathroom were very clean, an aspect that  i paid more attention to at any hotels i  stayed. But, the only downpoint was, the shower floor had this 'standing water', though not too much, it's still not comfortable. I  hope the management will check on this too during room cleaning.As for breakfast, (well, i rarely booked room with breakfast due to work commitment), MO certainly impressed me. There were so many people and yet the staffs seemed to be so organized and efficient. So though Kl still in Mco period, that kind of arrangement made people like me felt okay and less worried. The restaurant offered good varieties of food, but of course normally people wouldnt be able to stomach too much in the morning. Still, with the good ambience, u could enjoy some leisurely talk with your friends too.MO is so close to Klcc, less than 100m maybe. Walkable indeed.MO offered valet and lots of basement parking slots.In the future, i would love to come back and hopefully MO is still a cool worthwhile hotel.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

31,3.0,"Mandarin Oriental is a chain that I’ve always enjoyed. You know that when you check in to an MO hotel, it’s going to be a luxurious experience. MO Paris being one of my favourite hotels in the world.This was unfortunately not the case at MO Kuala Lumpur.Our first impression was of the super dark and dingy car park, which was a little scary. I would not feel safe parking downstairs if I was by myself.Getting to reception was easy enough, the lady who did our check in confirmed our dinner reservations for the next day, we got our keys and were on our way. We dropped off our things in the room and went off to KLCC for lunch and a stroll.Unbeknownst to us, our cards were demagnetised first whatever reason so we were stranded outside our door with all our shopping bags, and had to trek back to the front office to get our key cards reactivated. Not a big deal in retrospect, but annoying when you’re tired.The toiletries available were shockingly basic, if there was a QR code to scan for a more extensive list, we weren’t alerted to it. The towels are an odd size, about 1 foot short of being a hotel standard bath towel, and were extremely threadbare.We had the dinner buffet the next evening, and despite front desk confirming our reservation, and us calling to confirm the reservation before coming back to the hotel, they could not locate our reservation and we stood there yet again while they called front desk who was not responding. They gave up and just got us a table after 10 minutes of waiting.The food itself was wonderful but service yet again was touch and go. It took forever to get water glasses refilled but the chefs at the food stations were excellent.Overall the hotel does have its merits like it’s location, quality of food and beverage as well as pool and tennis courts, but overall it does not fully live up to the MO brand.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
32,5.0,"Staycation for 2 nights for my sister’s birthday. Initial impression not too good upon checking in as the check in queue was 15 people long and I was person 5 in the queue having to wait for half hour before my turn arrived. There were 2 lines and the right line was way faster than the left line. Apart from this, everything else was superb. The lady who helped me check in was exceptionally friendly. Her name was Jeannette. She was apologetic too for the long wait. She gave me a late check out time which I was pleased with it. The rooms were immaculate. I enjoyed spending my time in the room. Very cozy. Very neat. Every request of mine was addressed by my name and the service was superb. Jeannette and Mohana even surprised my sister with a song and cake at our room door. The pool was disappointing- very small rectangular pool that was mostly crowded. Apart from that, I was pleased with the high quality of service and the rooms and this hotel has definitely topped my list for the next staycation I will have. Absolutely in love with this hotel Naela","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

35,4.0,"Stayed in the Mandarin Oriental for a night for business - with access to club lounge. Room was big, nice and clean - a bit dated but comfortable. Aircon was a bit warm in the middle of the night but otherwise, all else was good. Bathroom was very clean with separate bathtub and shower stall. Personnel at the club lounge were polite and nice but service was slow - I reckon due to limited manpower - and selection of food were limited too. Ala carte food were available but only limited to one item in the menu per person with no repeats allowed. :( Fortunately, drinks were free flow.Breakfast spread was severely limited as well. Overall a good night's stay and due to low occupancy, they allowed me to check out late. Staff were all polite but I have the feeling they are stretched too thin......","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

46,2.0,"MO was a favourite staycation destination on mine since many years ago and I always look forward to their hospitality and warmth. However, a recent trip had changed this for me. The treatment we received from the staff were inconsistent, the bell service and doorman were amazingly friendly and efficient. Nonetheless, those at the front desk and club lounge were mostly unfriendly. Food service was particularly slow and very limited, not worth the extra we paid for club services.If booking with a steep discount or taking a package that allows for free upgrade to club rooms and lounge access then I guess it’s worth it. However, if you are like me, booking as an MO fan and are opting to pay extra for premium service (I paid for the club rooms and didn’t rely on a free upgrade as per some of their packages) then I advice you to consider elsewhere. MO is not what it used to be, it has lost its glitter and is now generic. No longer can you expect attentiveness to finer details and curated services as before. Staff is more concerned about informing you what you are allowed or not allowed to do (eg. If you think breakfast at the the coffee house is limited, the club lounge is worse - your even limited to ordering only one main course and no one even offered to get us more bread). No one was interested in asking if everything was fine or how the can help make it better. I note that some had very good experience with their stay. I guess it’s the lack of consistency that irks me, the MO brand used to be known for its excellence. To maintain its standards, it cannot be relying on one or two exceptional employees while the rest are just really unwelcoming to guests.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

I didn't go out from the room at all as I was kind of exhausted, had a very long nap on the amazingly comfortable king bed! I had a Deluxe City View Room King. I personally adored the bathroom the most.I was lazy to go out and decided to order an in-room dining service - Curry Laksa! It was absolutely scrumptious though it was fairly spicy, loved it. The breakfast was a buffet setting with great selections - Continental, Chinese, Malaysian, Indian and Healthy. I also loved the Mosaic restaurant interior design and layout, simply elegant.The overall customer service was excellent. Had an express check-out and it went smooth. On the other hand, I was a little bit unhappy because the room door could have been sound-proofed as I could literally hear people talking outside and whenever any room was under housekeeping.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

62,5.0,"Due to the MCO we were unable to take the holiday that we had planned for October Half Term. As a consolation, we decided to indulge in a night of luxury at The MO Hotel in KLCC. What a great consolation it was! A modern hotel without the generic trappings of a hotel that could be anywhere in the world. A recently refurbished and updated jewel in the KLCC Crown, blending the best of what's new and up to date with a traditional colonial, and oriental style. This was evident in the hotel's communal areas the hotel rooms. Most lavish was the delightfully appointed bathroom, reminiscent of The Great Gatsby  era of grandeur. The view of The Twin Towers and the sumptuous bedding made for a fantastically lazy staycation where one could just enjoy the views from the comfort of your bed. From the moment we arrived at the hotel and all through our stay the staff gave exemplary service.  Aslam at the door, Shayfikk at the Aqua Bar and Zana in the SPA everyone welcomed us with a friendly smile and assured us nothing was too much trouble to make our stay the best. As friends of the MO we enjoyed complimentary cocktail at the Aqua bar where we were warmly welcomed by Zana and looked after attentively by Shayfikk.Breakfast menu was wide and offered a great choice. The food we chose was plentiful, delicious and well presented. The best hotel breakfast we have had since moving in Malaysia. In summary a lovely luxurious hotel stay that was value for money. The positive experience created for us by the staff will make us always choose to return to the MO for another staycation. It is the staff and people of the MO that will ensure we return to this hotel instead of the others in KLCC   ensuring we recommend The Mandarin Oriental to all our friends and family.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

Location is very good as it is close to Suria and Pavillion for shopping and great restaurants. Rooms are lavish and amazingly good for the price I paid my staycation. Restaurant offering is exciting with a big buffet, great afternoon tea overlooking the park and a fantastic chinese restaurant. But above all, I was amazed by the service provided by their team and the attention to detail. From the arrival experience with doormen, reception to the pool, lai po Heen and mosaic team. Always a smile, always willing to please me and my friends by consistently being a step ahead of us. Now I know what stands for 5 stars service.

For dinner I ordered the the Tenderloin from the Grill, medium rare, thinking I was going to have a wonderful dinner.  When the dish came, I could not even cut the meat, leave alone chew the meat. I complained but was simply told that that's the way it is. My entire dish was taken away but nothing was replaced!!!  I was not only shocked but sadden that a luxury hotel of such does not even care about it's customer or at least get the chef to explain or at least replace my food!!!  ... so my colleagues  shared their dinner with me.  Totally disgusted. But then again maybe I am a local and not an expat!!!","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

The complimentary birthday cake was very thoughtful from the hotel (I purposely reminded them during check-in). However, MO needs to check the crowd control during breakfast time.

The environment are great and the comfort and cozy feeling unable to describe by words! I enjoy the TV in the bath tub, viewing Twin Tower while lay on the bed, and the fitness room was really good too! Overall is excellent for my celebration at here.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

We only found out when I ask about the lounge access details. Having beverages at any other time was no longer available / perhaps withdraw without inform now (which would be one of the usual benefits for club rooms).The meals at breakfast, tea and cocktail hour remained the same throughout our stay. We were also made to feel like 2nd class citizens when the hotel seemed to prefer to cater for foreigner (we're not allow to have a seat with nice view even it's empty but been told it's reserved???? Dunno for WHO, obviously, util the end hours e.g. 10+ am breakfast /  5.30 pm cocktail the nice view seat still remained empty - must me reserved for either Alien / Ghost.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5
74,1.0,"We booked 2 Club Park View King rooms for 2 nights. This was supposed to give us access to the club lounge. At no time (either during the booking process on the hotel official website or thereafter during communications with the hotel) where we informed that the club lounge was closed. We only found out when I made a call to ask about the dress code for the lounge. Whilst I understand that during RMCO, the lounge may be closed due to numbers etc, this should have been made transparent before one makes a booking.So instead of the lounge, we were told that breakfast, tea and cocktails could be enjoyed at Mosaic and lounge on the park. No mention about having beverages at any other time (which would be one of the usual benefits for club  rooms). The meals at breakfast, tea and cocktail hour remained the same throughout our stay. At cocktail hour, we were given a plate of 3 items as opposed to the usual buffet you would receive at the lounge. On the second night it was made even worse when we were given the same plate of food as the night before but the portions were even smaller (1/4 of a small stick of satay and one small spring roll, as compared with 2 sticks of satay and 2 small spring rolls the night before). We were also made to feel like 2nd class citizens when the hotel seemed to prefer to cater for walk-ins for their high tea and were given preference for seating in the lounge on the park.Breakfast at mosaic was a nightmare. Long queues to get in and tables placed close to each other. Guests were not told to wear masks and one was told to help yourself to juices and pastries. Imagine all the hands touching these items.Sadly, what was meant to be a birthday surprise for my mum turned out to be a very disappointing staycation. We heard such good reviews about the lounge and hence our decision to stay here. We were cheated of this experience and deceived as we weren’t informed of its closure.We have stayed at many hotels in club rooms, even during RMCO and these hotels have honoured their club floor offers and been fully compliant with SOPs.Four of us feel totally disappointed with this stay. We were offered an upgrade the next time we stay at the MO, but unfortunately we will not be taking up this offer.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

We had the BBQ dinner at the poolside one night and the whole family enjoyed it so much. Kids swam and ate while we chilled over some wines and cocktails!

I have hear a lot about the Mandarin group reputation but my stay can confirm the high standards this company has. Since the arrival, they welcomed us with a great smile and helped us with our luggage. It was the first time for my children in a luxury hotel and they were very surprised with every little detail the staff was having with all of us. Room were spacious, even with the extra bed in one of them. Fine quality finishes, luxury bathroom, all very clean, and great views to the park and the pool. My children could not resist and ran to the pool immediately were they stayed until they closed it at 9. Everyone very attentive, served complimentary water and provided fresh towels. Even recommended a delicious pizza in pool restaurant and we had two. Children were in heaven and very thankful to us for having such a wonderful stay. Hotel was very crowdy which did not diminish service quality. Even with full breakfast restaurant, one would expect long waiting but no, we were quickly seated and set to enjoy a great meal. There was always time for the team to take good care of our family. Loved live stations with assisted buffet, great touch from the Mandarin. We were very happy to see hotel so full, reflect of Malaysia  recovering from such terrible pandemic.Thank you Mandarin team for such a treat to our family!

Without having to elaborate, I just simply can say the stay was awesome with everyone that was involved with my stay was top notch. Only tiny disappointment was first day lunch at Lai  Po Heen. When you miss / forgotten to deliver an order/item for the Dim Sum lunch, you disturb the dining flow which otherwise I could have rated it 10/10.Looking forward for a return trip.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

The moment we stepped in my baby went to every corner and shouted 'oh wow' repeatedly. We were surprised with a birthday cake on the first night after we got back from our dinner and a box of praline chocolate the morning before we checked out. There was some minor issues with the room, which i communicated to their front desk, they were quick to address my complaint despite the full occupancy that weekend.

92,1.0,"Our first time at the “prestigious” MO branded hotel. Of course we were excited but even more looking forward to cut short this stay.In a world where travel industry businesses are gravely effected by the health pandemic one would assume that hotels, any hotels would do whatever they can to survive or even get bookings.We are appalled by the lack of professionalism and coordination that the hotel appear to be offering to their guests. The wait to the check in counter was easily 60minutes plus long and to wait for the room keys was tediously lengthy too.To make things worse, there’s NO SOCIAL DISTANCING at all!!! Kids running around the lobby, people not wearing face masks, entry & exit point not adhered to. Hugely disappointing experience even before getting to the check in counter. (Pictures attached)You will be able to save over 75%-85% if you “Grab” your food. They made multiple mistakes with our room service order. To be fair, that is acceptable because the hotel might be full. However, the food quality was shockingly dismal! Also, just get a room stay, their breakfast spread isn’t fine dining, even street foods have better class than what they’re offering. KLCC is just a healthy walk away for brekkie.I feel sorry to smaller hotel that had to shut down because of the pandemic but IMHO, this is one hotel that should be closed down or at least to rescind their glamorous status. Wake up MO!! Stop treating / cheating your guest like this.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

When we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, the view from our room was the KLCC and MO hotel. The hotel looks great from far away; tennis court and lively pool.That makes us deciding to try it for a night. I did not book the Club room and Suite because of the house rules restrict access to the guest below 12 years old and restriction of the Denim. We end up booking Executive with Park View room.Pro: Room deco was nice, fully carpet with IPTV, cheerful pool staff.Cons: Old looking toilet, herbs smell toilet amenities, unpleasant usher at the lobby cafe, dark parking area.Overall, we feel hotel can improve the quality of service.","Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur Hotel",4.5

What your pallette fesires, it is available at Curate breakfast, which is mind you, inclusive in the room rate. 2 coupons for each room.If there is a hotel you want to go to in Kuala Lumpur, there is no other hotel that you should choose but Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur, for its location, high standards of service, luxury and comfort.Still what makes Four Seasons most memorable is its people.

This stylish property oozes sophistication, and places more emphasis on modernity than tradition - much like KL itself. The room was plush and comfortable, and provided me with the perfect place to relax after a day of exploring Malaysia’s energetic capital city. Guests have the option to choose either city or park views. I wouldn’t say one is necessarily better than the other; it all comes down to personal preference.The service at the Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur was absolutely impeccable and I found the staff to be warm, friendly and genuine. I highly recommend heading to Bar Trigona for amazing cocktails which are made with sustainably sourced ingredients. Whilst I do value sustainably sourced food, I have to admit I’d never really given much thought to where cocktail ingredients come from before my stay here! The hotel’s infinity pool is sleek and stylish, with cool city views that make for great photos. I loved swimming over the city!

Sometimes these issues do occur but the lack of communication was just really bad.The hotel was completely overcapacity for what they could actually deal with. I understand that Covid restrictions mean greater staff workload but when you're paying this much it's not unreasonable to expect to hotel to get in extra staff (or just not sell every single room!)It took 15-20 minutes to even get a lift down to dinner because there were too many people waiting for lifts and the stairs were locked. Staff were also encouraging us to break the Covid restrictions and squeeze into already packed lifts.The food was pretty good, but again had long wait times. We couldn't get in the bar because it was totally full.The room was very nice.For a cheaper hotel a lot of this could be excused but it's really not what you'd expect from the Four Seasons.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

Swimming pool is big but no proper kids pool (the one near the adult pool is super cold so end up everyone use one common pool (SOP in place due to Covid precaution). Love their Loccitane toiletteries. The only area I found that is below expectation is the quite long wait for lift everytime; partly due to covid precaution as only 4 pax per lift.

Telling them the purpose of our stay during booking via email, they prepared cakes & little treats for all our children (3). I ordered deco which costed RM80 and they did it exactly as per the catalogue, nothing more :) We had the city-view room at 17th floor. Extra bed was given at no extra charges. The amenities are over the top - always love L'occitane products. They have a tablet in room where you can directly chat and/or request for anything with housekeeping or even food or spa. You can even actually just Whatsapp them and they will respond promptly! I requested for the kids bathrobe & slippers, which was quite and they kids really enjoyed as they get to feel something customized for them instead of always seeing only adults get it :DThe changing room by the pool is pretty impressive. Luxuriously designed and with sauna & steam bath. Small, but there were barely people there although it was Sunday morning, so we had the sauna all to ourselves. Separate for male & female though. Small wading pool for children. I think their pool is salted water which is a plus point.Overall its a great stay for couples & business, even with friends or solo. but for family I have my reservations due to the many sharp edges in the room. My daughter got a purple cheek when she slipped and bumped the bathtub handle, which the corner is pretty sharp. Luckily not hit the eye. I also notified the reception during check out there is a tiny sharp metal at their carpet (something like a stapler bullet) that I stepped on. Hope they managed to find & remove it before someone else got hurt.KLCC is just a walk away. Hence why its a perfect city staycation.

We have faced the problem from times to times the stay but the hotel took immediate action to solved the problem. This is something that four seasons a five stars hotel definitely earn it. We have problem with checking in as staffing was not offering to take our bag and some of the staff seems not to be updated in the information regarding the readiness of the facilities. I would suggest that the hotel staff should communicated in the same language. Moving to the 1st room, we have baht tub and toilet issues which we moved to 2nd room with lighting and speaker issue, 3rd room, we have the television issue and water issue. However, with changing room quite often. Me and my wife didnt want to change further anymore. On the last day, the lift of the hotel have the issue as well but it was okay. Despite the issue in every room that we stayed, we still loved the hotel and service that was offered to us. We went for the spa and the service is very nice. We also dine in Yu house almost every other day of our stay and love the food there. Bar facilities was great and cozy atmosphere. Swimming pool was a surprise to me that they even have music under the water, definitely one of the new experience. The curate restaurant where we have our daily breakfast is definitely recommended. Great variety of food and taste is nice. The sous chef is also very friendly as he talked with us most of the day. Overall, the staff is very friendly and always there to help us. The personalized service that allow us to communicate with them seamlessly is fantastics. The facilities is great and luxury and modern, however, i hope it will be fix and no issue next times as we definitely coming back again. I hope this would help others to chose one of the most fantastic hotel to stay in for your staycation",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

28,3.0,A nice stay with my family and applause to the scrumptious breakfast except for an unfortunate parking misinformation which is not detailed by the concierge staffs. Please ask them to explain the free parking access in detail because they don’t bother to tell you where to actually park and how you can get reimbursed. I actually spent an extra money for the misinformation. I don’t expect it for the price i pay. Please at least match the service i got from the overall stay.,Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

The room was amazing. It’s very spacious and comfortable. You get a beautiful view of the park and skyline. You can also see a bit of the twin tower on the side.

They served many types of cuisine for the breakfast buffet. Only regret is that I couldn’t eat more. In conclusion, everything was amazing. We have no dissatisfaction.

32,5.0,"Yes it’s true the price is on the higher end but but but every penny spent at this amazing hotel is worth it. All the staff are friendly and welcoming, one thing about FSKL the staff don’t judge you base on what you wear. We had the privilege to stay in the Junior Suite room 1111 and the view of the park is amazing and the room is so spacious. Furthermore my wife was lucky to get a slot for the spa treatment and from her reaction, she said it’s the best spa ever with all the amazing spa facilities. And lastly - Shout out to all these amazing stars at the hotel that made our stay memorable and even made me extended my stay from 1 night to 3 nights stay.

Excellent hotel service especially at front desk. Miss Teeve, the duty manager was very friendly and professional. But the hotel may need to improve reservations line because I had issue with my reservations. But luckily I was assisted by Miss Pq and Mr Zafran. Good customer service. I also wanted to compliment an excellent service from pool bar & grill, Mr Azhar. For breakfast buffet at Curate, there are many option and choices and the food are delicious.

34,5.0,"My daughter and myself checked in for a short staycation at the Four Seasons KL and it was by far the best decision we have made. It was our first trip away since Covid-19 and we were apprehensive about safety and we were not disappointed at all. Service was amazing from the minute we got out of our car. They knew our names (which made my daughter feel very special.).I had also told them that this was my daughter's belated birthday treat, and they really went all out to make my little girl feel so special, which i appreciated. They decorated our room, they had a birthday cupcake ready for her but more importantly, they really went out way to give us personalized service that made us feel so welcomed and at home. Everyone knew our name and made sure to check that we were okay at all times. We spent the day by the pool, where service was amazing as well. They were sure to tell us upon check in that the pool had music underwater - which amazed my daughter. We were served complimentary popsicles and infused water all day, which was a delightful addition to the delicious truffle fries and sandwiches we ordered. Breakfast that was provided was delicious (honestly the best waffles we have ever had in our lives!!!). Service was amazing from when we entered the restaurant. The chef came out to speak to us and again, made my daughter feel so special and welcomed.Location is fabulous (2 mins away from KLCC) with a Starbucks reserve right downstairs. Room service food (kids menu) was value for money and delicious. (we had the fries and hot dog). Special mention to the following Four Seasons Family who really did make us feel so welcome - Tan Veen Neer, Gurmit Singh, Swady Othman and Azhar (from the pool). All in all, it was more the soft touches of this amazing team that made my daughter tell me ""I havent felt this happy in a long time, Mummy"" and that made the whole trip worth it!

37,5.0,"I made a promise to the staff, ill write a review regarding my stay at FSKL recently. Let me just say my expectation was already high when i booked for a celebratory stay for my 6th Anniversary and still FSKL hit it out of the ballpark!Let me just start that the parking navigation need some work but thats beyond their control, for now haha. Everything was magnificent. From the lobby experience, calling us by our names (no i haven't even introduce myself) to the reception (upgraded our rooms and friendly staff) it already sets the scene that it is going to be such a personalized stay. Rooms were impeccable, the decoration was immaculate. Everything was how its was to be and more. The view overlooking the KLCC park was breathtaking. Not the first time we stay in a hotel adjacent to KLCC but FSKL somehow whisks us away in a different land it feels.We had our meals in Curate. I’ve never seen my sons gulping down 3 glasses of watermelon juice... each!! And the eldest is only 4!!! Not to mention the swaths of food on offer. We had the set and ala carte though i looked through the buffet line in wonder and planned a future visit by then already. That was even before the chef offered some of his choice dishes from the buffet for me to try and savor. And his selections were spot on! The Anniversary dinner was held in the Yun House. Again it was a customized set menu based on certain dishes we prefer. The oyster was off-menu but it was such a great dish! And the lobsters brought me back to the cool breeze of the ocean, simple and yet perfect in every way.Now mishaps happen and two things we had to address is first, the bathroom flooring can get very slippery, and second, my son had an accident while getting down from the bed. The first part, the hotel provided with so many floor mats, that we basically carpeted the bathroom making it very cosy and no longer slippery. The second part, they had an emergency response team already prepared by the time we head out from the room. And escorted us all the way ensuring a quick route down to my car. It turned out to just be a minor injury and we returned back to the hotel. This is where I have to give full credit to the staff, management and the hotel. The way they cared and fuss on my son, the calm way they act, and the attention they gave to ensure we have all the support required, that cannot be bought or paid for. And i cannot thank them enough for their response, so much so that we as a family never felt safer than where we were then. Like i told at the reception during check out, personally for me, I finally found the best hotel in Malaysia. And we will be back soon!Thank you, and keep up the wonderful work!",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

It really says a lot when my  teenage daughter who always prefer to stay home is looking forward to our next stay over! The facilities provided in the room were top notch. Nespresso coffee machine, toiletries from Loccitane and we didn't have to go to Japan to experience the super smart WC. There is sensor that opens the cover of the WC when it senses our presence and the temperature on the seat adjust to correspond with our body temperature! How cool is that!!! We were thrilled to bits...hehehe...Whenever we talk about our stay over at FS, it  brought us back to the warm and fuzzy feeling that were extended by each and every staff who crossed our path.

41,5.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but this prompted me to do so.I have always have the best hospitality experience with Four Seasons hotel with Malaysia (and Singapore, Dubai). We've had a short staycation after the lockdown in Four Seasons Hotel KL, and were treated like kings and queens.The service is undeniably the best in class, from the concierge, the frontdesk, the in-room service, housekeeping, cleanliness, it was all top notch. Special thanks for Mr. Amirul from the frontdesk that ensured the check-in process was a breeze.We've had some hiccups with the rooms, and the maintenance went straight to action and fixed it immediately. They even personally followed up, and remembered our names to ensure everything went smoothly.On top of that, I had also arranged for the surprise anniversary arrangement in the room with flowers and balloons. Mr. Gurmit Singh from the Guest Experience team ensured everything went according to plan, he took hospitality to the next level, and also gave my toddlers a small plush toy from the hotel.Apart from the frontdesk and housekeeping team, I also want to applaud the team at Curate especially Ms. Kiva that ensured we have the best breakfast service.Though we couldn't use the 'Vitality pool' at the hotel - its a heated outdoor jacuzzi pool, overall we enjoyed the facilities there.In terms of Covid-19 safety and precautions, we absolutely felt safe staying at the hotel. Everyone wore face masks in the public areas, common areas were sanitized and cleaned regularly, we were given alcohol wipe and complimentary face masks in the room.We would definitely be happy to stay here again when we have the chance in the near future.

After jogging, arrived at the hotel lobby, Mr Razman handover a bottle and a wet wipes for each of us. Thanks Mr Razman ️In addition, we have a high tea session. The staff there also surprisingly polite. The staff came to our table suddenly after he saw us struggling take our photo. I cant remember the staff name hihi.

Besides The Shoppes, the Four Seasons Hotel KL is right next to KLCC and opposite Avenue K for shopping and dining.

60,5.0,"There are 5 Star Hotels that give lousy service & there are 5 Star Hotels that give outstanding service. Four Seasons KL is one of those 5 Star hotels that provide astonishing service!Prepare to get your jaw-dropping experience starting from your arrival until departure. Me & my wife went there from Shah Alam for leisure (since we were still not allowed to travel overseas because of the CMCO).We went there by car & parked our vehicle on level B4. Be sure to park your vehicle on B4 instead of other levels because if not, you’ll need to double validate your parking ticket, which can be quite a hassle. And yes, the parking is complimentary for all hotel guests. Just make sure you take the normal ticket instead of using Touch&Go upon entering because I don’t think they can give complimentary parking for Touch&Go.We were greeted by the staffs at the lobby & one staff quickly offered an assistance for our luggage. We were told to scan the MySejahtera QR Code and our body temperatures were taken by an automatic temperature scanner which worked effectively. You may also find hand sanitizers on every corner. We were directed by a staff to go the reception upstairs on level 6B.Our checking in process went super smooth, thanks to the receptionist that are well trained. Unfortunately after registration, we need to wait for our room to be ready due to high occupancy the night before. We roamed around KLCC while waiting for our room to be prepared and the next hour, the hotel’s receptionist called & informed that we may enter our room.The room that we’ve got was Pool Garden-View Room & it was absolutely breathtaking. The room was squeaky clean, kudos to the housekeeping team that took care of it! All the amenities provided were more than enough. The bath amenities provided were from L’Occitane. For the room entertainment, the hotel provides 55” Samsung Smart HDTV which offers almost all important Astro Channels. If you’re a football fan like me, fret not, all Astro Sports Channels are available for viewing. On top of that, the TV also offers mobile/laptop mirroring and whatever you put on the TV, the audio will be playing along in your bathroom area so that you can bathe yourself in the super cozy bathtub while listening to your favorite music.The gym equipment provided were more than enough for a light workout and during my run on the treadmill, a staff named Mr. Amirul approached me and offered me a drinking water. He also informed me to search for him if I need any assistance. The swimming pool is medium sized but sufficient enough for a quick dip. The view from the pool was magnificent and I love the fact that you’ll hear music whenever you swim underwater.Our breakfast at Curate was simply amazing. They offered many variety of food that you may choose from but my personal favorites will be the waffle & yellow mee with chicken soup. During our breakfast, the staffs were always making sure that our coffee/tea will be refilled whenever our cup was going to be empty. The manager personally went from table to table just to make sure that our breakfast needs were fulfilled. I forgot to mention on how lovely the restaurant was decorated. It feels like you’re having your breakfast in a beautiful garden.If I keep on writing this review, I’m pretty sure that I will be writing a complete essay so I will just stop here because there are so many things that I could write about! It’s all about the tiniest details that have always amazed me. And yes, that is what Four Seasons KL Hotel staffs were particularly good at; All those small details that have proven to give enormous impact. We will definitely stay here again in the future! Oh yea, I forgot to mention that our original booking was only for a night but because we loved the place so much, we extended our stay for another night.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

62,3.0,"I recently stayed for 2 nights at the Four Seasons and was rather disappointed by the less than 5 star experience, especially for a brand like theirs.I had problems with the hot water in the toilet the day I checked in. When I informed the front desk, 2 maintenance workers were sent and all they did was to run the taps for about 5 - 10 mins, until the hot water came on. I thought the problem was resolved, but later that evening realized that the same problem recurred, but I was too tired to call again. By the way, no one from the front desk called back to check whether the problem was resolved. And the two maintenance guys did not wear gloves etc and made me feel uncomfortable because of hygiene concerns.The next morning, I informed the front desk of the issue and they were kind enough to offer a room change. And they went the extra mile to upgrade me to a bigger room.Breakfast at Curate was also rather disappointing - the ""prawn dumpling"" had some kind of mince meat in it, which I suppose was prawn meat but tasted more like something ""processed"". On the other hand, my room service meal was actually really good.I have stayed at many 5 star hotels for business, and this one definitely does not live up to it's expectations. Probably convenient for the business traveler, but if you're looking for a relaxing experience, I'd suggest you go somewhere else.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

The children especially found the speakers placed inside the pool (so you get to swim with some calming tunes underwater) and the heated bubble pool, highly amusing! We had the park-facing corner junior suite and the garden facing room for our teenagers, so although we didn’t have a view of the twin towers, looking at the dancing fountains (for the park view) and the residents pool (for the garden view) was nice too. If there’s space/ resources , a kids’ club might be something the hotel would want to add in, in future. Especially since KLCC playground was closed due to CMCO!All in all, we highly recommend this place for its service, nice rooms & facilities and wonderfully central location within the city!

I would believe that there were so much grate guest engagement from every single staff in the hotel .I wish we could extend our stay. definitely we will come back to see you all next coming year. Happy new year to everyone. Thank you very much :),Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
67,5.0,"Four Seasons KL is one of the newer member hotel within the acclaimed hospitality Group, having commenced operation only relatively recently in Nov18.The location of the hotel cannot be faulted, being within walking distance of the iconic PETRONAS Twin Towers (the tallest twin towers in the world) and its integrated Suria KLCC luxury shopping mall, KLCC Park, Avenue K shopping centre (across the road) and KL Tower (one of the tallest telecommunications tower in the world).Service from the point of entering the hotel at the front entrance was nothing short of exemplary.A special commendation for a job well done to the reception team, Mr. Zariff and his colleagues (TV and Kunio) who were particularly friendly and professional in handling our check-in process. Mr. Zariff even took the liberty of helping to make a reservation for our dinner later that night at Yun House.Kudos also go to the housekeeping and engineering teams who were prompt in resolving our request for firmer pillows as well as to sort out a small issue with our blackout curtains.The room features modern conveniences such as an iPad-like device (with useful hotel-wide information), an automated heated toilet bowl  with numerous features as well as L'Occitane-branded bathing essentials (shampoo, conditioner, shower oil, body soap, bath salt). A bath tub is provided in addition to the standard shower cubicle (handheld and rain shower).Some other assorted observations:-- Access to the hotel parking is via the connected Shoppes retail centre (at level B4 past 2 barriers). Roadside signage on this could have been clearer.- The bedside multi-lighting panel can be confusing to operate.- A possible point of improvement is for briefings on the hotel room features to be provided especially for first-time guests.- Buffet-style breakfast at Curate is back (served by restaurant staff).- At the moment, there is a 20% promotional discount on in-hotel F&B purchases for hotel guests (cost to be charged to the room).- The reception is located at level 6B with the main dining establishments (such as Yun House, Curate, The Lounge and Bar Trigona) situated from levels 5B-6B).- You will need to change lifts to go to Yun House (the rest of the aforementioned dining areas are at the same floor as the reception).All-in-all, Four Seasons KL is an excellent and stylish staycation choice if one wishes to pamper oneself during the on-going pandemic restrictions. Everything worked out as hoped for with a strong touch of professional and personalised service which is at the end of the day what you would want from a leading top tier hotel chain such as Four Seasons.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
68,5.0,"I was invited by Omega, the luxury Swiss Watch company, to attend a 1-night event at this property on 17th December 2020. I stayed in corner suite 1011 and it was amazing. I had unobstructed views of the KLCC Park and the surrounding area. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the Malaysian government's Health & Safety standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the dreaded coronavirus, the event was conducted virtually, with speeches and technical workshops on Omega watches streamed Live from Bienne, Switzerland, straight to the television set in our rooms. Our 3-course dinner was served to us in our rooms too, we had a foie-gras dish for appetizer, half an oven-baked chicken with cranberry sauce for the main course and a cream tart with mixed berries for dessert.The room was tastefully decorated, with modern contemporary fittings and amenities. The curtains and roll-down blinds are controlled via electronic panels, the light switches have modern dimmers, the air-conditioning had user-friendly control panels and the lavatory seat was the most impressive; it has a range of different functions operated via a control panel that looks like an iphone mounted on the wall, and the seat cover opens automatically whenever I enter the lavatory cubicle! The toiletries are by L'Occitane and the bath towels are soft and fluffy. The King-sized bed was the most comfortable that I have ever slept on, in any hotel around the world. They provided me with 6 down-pillows, however, I found the pillows too soft. This wasn't the hotel's fault by any means, it was just my personal preference. So I called the housekeeping department and requested for a firm pillow from their pillow menu. They promptly delivered 1 to my room. During my stay, due to the pandemic, the hotel doesn't provide the usual full stationery set in the rooms. So I called the front desk and requested for 2 writing pens and 2 writing pads, and these were delivered to my room promptly as well.The location of this property is second to none: it is located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur's Golden Triangle, right next to KLCC park, the iconic Petronas Twin Towers and lots of shopping venues and eateries within walking distance.All-in-all, I had a wonderful stay at this property and I highly recommend it to all discerning travelers who wish to enjoy luxurious accommodation combined with excellent location in downtown Kuala Lumpur.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
69,5.0,"I checked in here on 17th December, it was my Anniversary and my son’s birthday celebration. From the bellboy, who assisted us to the main entrance lobby to the room, I forgot his name but He’s Indian Tall boy, and then met Mr Rozman (he was the one who bring in my event planner straight away to our room even brought the bouquet of flowers for the surprise) until the receptionist named Kunio and Zariff. They are all Superb!! We got every little things complimentary and special amenities for this celebration from the hotel, they even decorated our room!! I just had a fantastic moment staying there, In addition to that, I must say, when we go for high-tea and evening cocktails, the guy named Iskandar whom always assist my family and We havent finished the meals but he could send up the balance of food to our room with extra-mile by  packing up the ice chocolate some more. God, i cant believe them, when we celebrated my son’s birthday, we go downstairs wearing our cosplay (tiger costume) to take picture at the Lobby and also Bar Trigona place. Zariff and Kunio were there taking our pictures and not even tired in treating us very very friendly they even gave our son the tiger bear!!! I even left behind my phone charger, i called back Hotel and one guy named Saiful answered and assist to pick it up back.  By far, THIS IS THE 5 STAR HOTEL that I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO COME AGAIN IN 2021 and also we do have plan to go to Four Seasons in Langkawi. We will surely come back to FSKL.

75,5.0,"Thank you FSKL and no wonder you're in top 3 in Asia! Mr Gurmit made our stay especially special for our anniversary and birthday for my daughter. During the pandemic, they kindly made our staycation above par. They prepared the room incredibly with not just flowers, but decorations on bed, chocolates and gifts and so many other things. We were amazed.The food at breakfast was also great spread and we were one of the few staying there.We couldn't fault it at all, even check in was in our room! Wow! We felt like we were treated like royalty, that is the FS motto I suspect. They knew our names, they still remember us every time we pass by when we park at the Robinsons to go to KLCC and we pass by the foyer. Loveliest service of any KL hotel we've been in. We did a week of staycation in different hotels including Mandarin Oriental, W hotel, Four Seasons and Sekeping Tenggiri. Four Seasons was the best by far of all. Thank you.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
76,5.0,"FSKL was among the two hotels that I wanted to stay at during my business trip. It was purely business for me whilst it was a staycation for my parents. The room given was superb. In the year of the pandemic, they even upgraded my room to one with an amazing view. Admittedly, I had to do a bit of hotel-hopping for work in November. However, I fell in love with FSKL from the moment I stepped into the room. The beds are VERY comfortable which I had to refrain myself from as I had to work late that night. The coffee machine was a lifesaver and choice of pods, awesome! Breakfast spread was good and value for money, that's for sure! Ms. Saima & Ms. Sukyee were ultimate rockstars in making my stay an unforgettable & superb one. From the room bookings to check-in and then making sure everything was smooth right up to check-out. My parents had a wonderful visit as well. Honestly, I've never cared for staycations but this experience has made me want to go back to FSKL ""just because"".. and my parents are already asking me, when is OUR next staycation here! Looks like I gotta start making a reservation soon.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
77,4.0,"Had our staycation on 29th Nov 2020. Our room has been upgraded to pool view instead of city view. The staff explained it was due to the renovation works on the city view side. Upon check in, we were also greeted by the hotel chef as I had specially requested a customised breakfast for my lovely pregnant wife due to her diet restriction.The room is modern with digital touch to control all the lights, curtain and so on. We were welcomed with a very sweet decoration, hand written greeting card and chocolate Swiss roll for our 2nd wedding anniversary celebration. The room also equipped with iPad where you can directly chat with the hotel staff for dining reservations, pillow and etc. Not to forget, you can also request for pregnancy pillow!! That’s a plus point! Also, you may read their subscribed magazine and evening newspaper from the iPad. The TV is with Android/Apple mirroring feature where you can connect and project your phone or laptop for bigger screen. The bed was comfortable and we had a really good rest.The only downside was the toilet had an unpleasant smell. For a 5-stars hotel, i think this should be improved.We wanted to make a reservation at the Yun House to try their dim sum but was fully booked. Maybe next round :) Our dinner at Curate was good. The Ultimate Signature Burger was delicious with juicy wagyu beef patty. I personally like the half Sabah poached lobster with Mac and Cheese Kampung. The meal portion was big too!Apparently Curate during dinner was short handed when we wanted to end the bill. We have been waiting for 15 minutes just to get the bill.The hotel is very near to KLCC in few footsteps. You may also grab your coffee with some handpicked sandwiches easily from the Starbucks Reserve.The breakfast at Curate, specially prepared by the hotel chef was amazing and we felt so happy to have warm greetings from the chef. He always make sure the meals served were alright. The chef even made us the hidden menu meal - Mee Sua with herbal soup. The taste was beyond amazing. My wife was so in love with it.Will come back again if the lounge is open and hope to enjoy the dim sum at Yun House in the near future.",Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

At the check in desks the process was quick, I was informed about the chat and Apps that they had. I had booked the spa and they had confirmed my bookings a day before I arrived, with suggested packages to look into.  My spa therapist Kina was an absolute gem. She really put me at ease after months of being afraid to go for a massage.  She was really experienced and I had a great session. Felt so refreshed after that.My room was well sanitised and cleaned daily.  I had received some complimentary fruit baskets and cakes, very thoughtful of them.

98,5.0,"With Four Seasons famed internationally with their service quality levels, FSKL did not disappoint. From the room booking where Isaac did a fantastic job ensuring my birthday staycation was smooth and memorable (an upgrade, a free valet parking, reserving a table at Bar Trigona was a major plus). Huge difference is that he also followed through and updated the arrangements via call and email; that he also personally greeted me and ensure my check-in is right before I adjourn to my room. To comment in overall, attitude and service level by various departments are simply exceptional - ALL OF THEM would go all out, to ensure all customers’ needs are fulfilled. The amazing part is they are sincere, to make your day. At the Spa, reception is courteous and masseuse is skillful; all servers at the breakfast place are also very attentive, constantly fulfilling the needs of our breakfast (A’la Carte) requests as buffet is not available due to the CMCO; special thanks to Vyna (from Bar Trigona) and John (front desk) for following up on the receipt that I’ve lost; also Nicholas for the birthday room decoration and Zariff, for the smooth check-out.  Despite the exceptional service and comfortable room stay, the taste of the food served at breakfast and in-room dining can definitely be improved. This is said after comparison of my previous stays in St. Regis, W KL, EQ and Grand Hyatt. All in all, it has been a wonderful and rejuvenating weekend birthday staycation.

13,3.0,"Stayed on the 6th-7th March weekend in the Studio Suite as part of our belated birthday weekend.  Living La Vida Local package included breakfast + dinner. (We were coming from a night at the EQ, so a lot of comparison to be made as both hotels are similar in price.)PRE-ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN Contacted by Maliha via WhatsApp on the eve of my arrival which was a nice touch. Usually, hotels would reach out via email. Requested for an early check-in but was told that a lot of rooms had back-to-back reservations, but she would inform if our room was ready earlier. However, half hour before check-in time was informed that there was a slight delay in getting our suite ready as they had a late check-out. We were already checking out of EQ at this point and was just hoping that they could get the room ready by the time we arrive at 3pm.Arrived at W around 3:30pm and guess what? Our suite was still not ready. Asked if there were any upgrades available (our package entitled us to a complimentary upgrade to next category subjected to availability) but was told that the suites above our category were full. Big let-down in service from a 5-star hotel. If they knew the room was going to be occupied the next day, why permit the previous guest a late check-out? Anyway, we were given the option to wait in a different room or at the Wet Deck. We chose the latter and was given complimentary drink vouchers while we wait.It was close to 4:30pm when we finally got to access our suite. The studio suite is slightly smaller than the Marvellous suite and did not have the Twin Towers view.Studio Suite No 1509 W Hotel KLROOM REVIEW:Very spacious to say the least. Big living area with an elevated island, bar stools, big TV and a powder room. The bedroom is also huge with a vanity table and huge closet. The bathroom has got to be the highlight of it all, separate shower and toilet with a big oval tub (and tv!) that our toddler thoroughly enjoyed. However, the many low-hanging fixtures might not be suitable for a family with small children.The view was truly nothing to shout about as it overlooked Jalan Ampang with its surrounding buildings and even had the Muslim cemetery behind Hotel Maya in sight. Safe to say we had our electronic blinds down for most of our stay.In terms of comfort, the bed is truly amazing. Having spent the previous night in EQ and its hard mattress, W's is definitely a million times better. However, we found that the bedroom section of the suite was very warm compared to the living area. Our toddler was sweating in bed. Called up Whatever Whenever to ask if there was a separate thermostat in the bedroom. After some back and forth, a staff member came in and told us the only control for the AC was in the living area. We felt that there might not be a vent for the AC in the bedroom as when we closed the door between the bedroom and living room there was a definite difference in temperature. In the end they sent up a tower fan and we had to sleep with the bedroom door open to keep us cool enough to sleep. I'm not sure if this is a design flaw or just so happen that the bedroom vent was not working but staying in a high-end property should not require this much effort to sleep comfortably.FOOD:The breakfast is another highlight of our stay. The selection was good (especially compared to our previous breakfast in EQ) and everything is delicious. The best part however has got to be the free flow pandan coconut. This truly sets the breakfast at W apart from the likes of Grand Hyatt and Four Seasons. The service during breakfast is also very good, the staff were attentive and friendly.Dinner on the other hand was very disappointing. We were entitled to a 3-course dinner for two as part of the package we booked. For our toddler we ordered something off the ala-carte menu. The complimentary Italian-style bread helped to keep the hungry 2-yo happy and thankfully the kitchen got our toddler’s dinner ready very quickly. The main problem that we had was with the 3-course dinner. We waited more than an hour and only received the starter. Our kid had finished his dinner and we were still left waiting for the mains to arrive. Imagine we were left with an empty table but was still very much hungry.  Other patrons who had arrived (and ordered) later than us managed to be served their mains earlier than us. We finally had to request for the remainder of our food to be sent to the room as it was getting close to the kid’s bedtime. The staff was very apologetic and admitted that this kind of thing should not be happening. To make it up for the disastrous timing of our food arrival, the ala carte order for the kid was complimentary. POOL:The pool area affords the best view of the towers. Going there early in the AM allowed us to get the pool all to ourselves. Staff was attentive and polite. Even switched on the jacuzzi feature for just the three of us. There were a couple of floating oversized pillows that you can go on and apart from the stairs and bench (by the jacuzzi nozzles) there were not many kid-friendly areas in the pool. Check out was uneventful (although they wanted to charge us for the ala carte dinner we ordered!) and the staff was all very courteous and polite.  Not sure what exactly happened to W Hotel KL, maybe they had an overwhelming weekend and was unable to cope? Having stayed at Grand Hyatt, EQ, Four Seasons, Majestic Hotel and other non-high-end properties during weekends, this was one of the most eventful (not in a good way) stay for us. Hopefully they are able to improve and if the price is right, we might consider giving them another chance (especially with that buffet breakfast).",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

We were a bit skeptical to choose W because we have small kids and W being recognized as a hype hotel for the young ones might not be suitable for us with kids around.We were totally wrong!!! It was a hotel with   Wonderful hospitality that made us feel very much Welcome. The kids love it and wanted to be back again.We took the Living La Vida local package and it was WORTH it!!!My utmost Thank You to the following people who were out there giving us a Wonderful service and experience.1. Harvi - who attended to my queries from the start and ensured all my requests were taken care.2. Ashley - who handled my check in and out process. I booked two rooms and it is located at two different floors. She took the initiative to provide me additional key cards for both rooms of the different floors for the convenience of us moving around. Little thought counts!!!3. Hasnizam (chef at the Flock). A bit of hiccup during dinner but he put on the extra effort to explain the situation at the table prior of us asking. He was also around during Breakfast to ensure everything runs smoothly. We felt appreciated.4. Maliha for the cheeky wishes in my Dad's birthday card.I hope I got all the names right.

21,4.0,"So, this is the 3rd review and saving the best for the last in a series of 3 progressive review covering the W Hotel KL. 3rd review since this is our family's 3rd stay at W hotel. Progressive, since the 1st stay was at the more basic Spectacular room, 2nd stay was at a Marvelous Suite and the 3rd stay, the finale - EXTREME WOW or EWOW suite.EWOW - this is the pinnacle of W Hotel KL and in W brand, is the priciest, biggest, most elaborate, luxurious, blah, blah..... suite you can get. Not every W branded hotel globally have a EWOW suite, though most will have this. Although categorized as luxury by Marriott, W hotels doesn't follow the classical luxury as carried by other Marriott brands (RC, St R. JWM & non-Marriott  like 4S, MO, GH etc). And so, like all other rooms in W, they do not have the classical Presidential / Royal suite kind of a theme, which is more suited for official purposes. Instead W hotel goes for something that's more ""whatever, whenever"", which is W's moto. And this review is about how we felt about the EWOW suite at W hotel KL.Again, we took the AMP-up-your-stay package with the opportunity to experience the EWOW suite for 2 full days. As previously reviewed, AMP is probably the best package you can get in town today, at least in KL, and even compared to packages from other non-Marriott hotels. (Too bad, it is running out by 29th May 2021, so, book it while you still can... W, Mr. Christian Metzner, please extend this package if you can....). As ambassador elite, I've stayed in many suites, and in our last upgraded stay at the Marvelous suite, I commented that the Marvelous suite was excellent for this category of suite. Only the suites in St. R. KL Sentral are the larger for a similar category suite comparison.The EWOW suite is in a completely different class altogether. The EWOW @ W KL is probably the largest single-room suite of any-kind you can find in KL at 520sqm. Reaching the top floor, and stepping out of the lift, the 2 full sized doors to the EWOW suite awaits you. You'll have Extreme high expectations, you know its a huge suite and you'll very likely feel this the minute you step into the suite - this is not an ordinary suite. The large floor space is coupled with a high ceiling. The living and dining/snack area (?) and the bedroom has high ceiling (may 16-18 feet high), giving the feeling of vast, open space. When you start exploring the suite, you'll realize that in effect, the 520sqm is probably separated into 3 areas - the indoor, the swimming pool and the surrounding corridor area. Lets start with the indoor.Indoor - I estimate that this probably covers +/- 350sqm. It does feel vast and relatively well appointed. It includes the living, snack area, small pantry, rowing machine/spa area, very small work area, bedroom with walk in wardrobe and bath/shower room. The focus is on the living & snack area since this is the 1st area which catches your eyes when you walk in. They are connected and well spread out. Just to give an idea of the space, the living room has a 70"" TV model. Frankly, due to the size of the living room, this TV felt really tiny (like a 32""/40"") although its not. I think 120"" TV will be more appropriate and would give the living room a larger EWOW factor. The living room had a long J-shaped sofa which you can sit on both sides and quite a few other armchairs. But somehow, we did have some reservations on the layout and the sofa, maybe again, because the living room was vast. We felt that the sofa was a bit shallow on both sides and that the main side could have been much deeper (like those in the standard WOW suite), this could result in the sofa being more comfortable and may even make the living room a little bit more complete (there's plenty of room to do that). The chic, snack area. This is what I called it because its definitely not a proper dining area. The counter-top is quite high but the 6 chairs seems a bit too low (maybe I'm a shorty). I guess maybe this area would really be perfect for a stand-up, gather-around, blow-a-birthday-cake, have-a-few-drinks-standing-up, chit-chat, dance-around-some-music concept. Its a nice snack area, though we didn't use this place much. Moving to the bedroom/walk-in/bathroom. These were closer to perfect compared to the living / snack area, but also not without small niggles (e.g. the bedside hanging lamp was always in the way of the bedside control panel, no USB etc). Like the living, space is really the WOW factor here and it overlooks the KLCC. The walk-in wardrobe have a his-and-her side, this was much appreciated. The bathroom was huge and for once, we had both a XL sized bathtub and XL sized rain shower. The XL sized rain shower was quite a cool factor and it also meant that this was one of the very few times I've actually used a rain shower in a hotel suite (most rain shower in most hotel/suites are too small). Corridor - One thing that we liked is that the living & bed room have sliding doors which can open up to the long corridor area which surrounds the indoor area. There are plants all around this corridor. This provides a relaxing green lung which you could walk out anytime, have a stroll, feel the constant breeze, breath some (errrr) fresh air, listen to some loud-modified-bikes-revving-up-to-10kRPM, etc.As we stayed there on the 15th of the lunar month, on the clear night, we had a bright moonlit night and the KLCC within view....I think the corridor plays an important role to the EWOW. You may not directly notice it, but as you stay longer in the EWOW suite, you'll likely appreciate this very much as you know there's no confinement to just an indoor area.The only issue I had with the corridor area is that there were too many pillars (and thick ones), which blocks what could have been an expansive view.Swimming Pool - This is the last area of the EWOW suite. And wow, this would be one of the highlight of the stay. I think EWOW suite W KL is the only high-rise suite in KL which has its own swimming pool and its a real pool, not a useless tiny-weeny plunge pool. This is a great place to be in and you can relax in that area for a few hours everyday. Just don't dip into the pool too much. Why? Coz the pool area is covered so the sun can't heat up the pool and the pool constantly felt cold. So, while we used the pool a few times, we didn't spent too much time in the pool itself (there was a temptation to ask for hot-water and more hot-water to heat it up a little... like the kid on BONVOY channel asking for more-n-more ice...). Nevertheless, having your own pool area is wonderful.Overall - Putting the whole EWOW suite back together. Overall, I'll say that the EWOW suite is really WOW but needs a little rearrangement / improvement to make it Extreme perfect and even more useable. As an EWOW suite, the expectations are very high, and while it can be rated Very Good, its not quite Excellent, thus the 4-star.Nevertheless, the EWOW suite is quite Extreme and qualifies to be called so. I would also say that you do need to stay more than 2 nights to fully appreciate the EWOW suite, given its vastness, openness and space, it takes some time for this appreciation to sink in. Once you have that feeling, you would miss the EWOW suite when you check-out.Lastly, from a services perspective, this is excellent as reviewed previously, and a big thank you to W for providing an excellent service, especially for a small incident that had happened during the stay.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

41,5.0,"This is a very specific review of a staycation at W Hotel during the M'sian Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) period. This review may not be applicable during normal times, as the stay environment may be different. This review is applicable to any residence in M'sia thinking of a staycation at W Hotel during this period. And especially if you are a  Platinum/Titanium/Ambassador Elite Member.Perhaps during this difficult times for the travel industry, most hotels have come up with some pretty interesting and good staycation packages which caters for locals. W Hotel had come up with one particular package - AMP UP YOUR STAY. This package includes a 2 nights stay with a RM1000 hotel credit, which is applicable to most of the Hotel restaurants (excluding Willow) and the spa. The package price would depend on the room type which you choose, but its applicable to the lowest category room, which is the Wonderful room. This was the package which I booked and I would say, it is an absolutely great package which W came up with. You probably wouldn't get this kind of packages during normal times, and to local Platinum Elite members (& above) thinking of a family staycation within the next few weeks, this is the package for you. Just book it, don't think twice .... Reason below.As an Ambassador Elite, I was upgrade to Marvelous Suite, that's probably the highest suite level which anyone can get upgraded to. Only the WOW & EWOW suite remains higher, and from previous experiences, its rare to get upgrade to the top 2 tier rooms and this is also the same for St. Regis KL (rarely they upgrade, even for Ambassador's) to the Carolina / J. Jacob suite, unless, maybe you stay at these hotel very regularly and know someone inside, i don't know. But the Marvelous Suite is a great suite and a significant upgrade from Wonderful, over 1100+ sqft, large bedroom enough to squeeze 2 rollaways (if you have 2 kids), and comfortable living room. So, 1st up, Elite membership was recognized and full points (5 star) for that (if they gave me the WOW, I'll probably write an extra chapter to compliment that... LOL). However, the check in counter forgot the standard recognition of ""thank you for being our Ambassador....blah blah"" no big deal for me actually, but this is a Marriott practice.However, while the Marvelous Suite was great, it wasn't 100% perfect (probably 90%) and though it was still quite a new hotel, there where somethings which started to give niggles. As an example, the shower had both the hand billet and the rain shower simultaneously functioning together and the bathroom tap was too low and close to the sink. These problem were not serious, and for the shower, they had 2 separate shower billet in the same shower room and the other one was functioning OK. Yes, 2 separate shower billet in the same shower room, so, good to get some romantic showers.....Aside from that, the room was OK when it comes to cleanliness, supply of towels, amenities, drinking water was always enough, the room had enough bright natural sunlight with KLCC view from the bathroom to the KL Tower from the living room.The reason why we choose the ""AMP UP YOUR STAY"" package was because we had no plans to venture outside of the hotel too much due to the CMCO period, which means, we had hotel credit to mostly dine at the hotel. Which we did:1) 2 complimentary breakfast (so you can still get the 1000 points welcome gift), thanks W.2) RETOX semi-buffet dinner (RM198 pp nett during CMCO, without alcoholic beverage package), my kids ate free3) Ala-carte dinner (30% discount for Titanium/Ambassador during this period)4) Free evening welcome drinks + snack at WET-DECK (as they don't have exec. lounge for Plat's and above)5) Lunch snack at the WoobarSo, 2nd up, food was well taken care off (and good quality food), and hotel credit is really useful and can be fully utilized, full 5 stars here also.Unfortunately, there's quite limited restaurant at W, so we spent most of the food time at Flock. But luckily, we were familiar with W KL, and we were already expecting this. Despite the CMCO, Flock was still quite busy and during the RETOX, the buffet spread had probably been slightly reduced and instead, Flock introduce a semi-ala-carte buffet. The ala-carte quality was probably better, because, then it is cooked to order and you can still eat as much as you want. Service at Flock and WET DECK was good, very good. Very attentive staff, constantly checking to your needs and ensuring you are well served.  The only unfortunate part of this stay was that WET (the swimming pool) was not open due to CMCO and this was a small set back. We had been looking forward to this and this wasn't informed on the W-website. Overall, we had a very pleasant and relaxing get-away stay for a couple of nights (and probably gain some weight thereafter). Almost all positive and very-very little to complain about given the current CMCO circumstances, and this is the reason why this review is probably more specifically applicable to locals whom are considering a similar get-away. Now considering a second AMP UP YOUR STAY soon.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

51,5.0,"Stylish, sleek and dimly lit, The W in Kuala Lumpur is a luxurious vibrant hotel with clever, funny touches in their design and an energy of possibility. Was it the right place for two married normals to celebrate 20 years together? Absolutely, why not? We enjoyed cocktails and a hookah amidst the beautiful young rich kids in designer clothes and bottle services and just took in the stunning view of the twin towers. No one minded mom and dad giggling like teenagers again at a private table, making jokes about movies they’ve probably never even heard of. Lots of pretty saucy touches to the hotel room, mirrors above the bed, intimacy kits, chocolate body paint. If you’re a beautiful rich horny person, this place is for you! Or hey, if you’re a couple of married norms looking to try something new - this could be for you too! Service, impeccable. ",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

We were upgraded to a nice corner room which was already a very pleasant surprise and was greeted with a little cake + balloons to celebrate the occasion. The view of the twin towers at the pool deck was amazing, even our hotel room allowed us to soak in the twin towers in all its beauty We ended our stay with lunch at Yen Cantonese restaurant, and since it was our first time there, we asked one of the staff to recommend some of the delicacies to us. Mr Elvin Wong's recommendations was spot on and a total delight as we absolutely enjoyed the Xiao Long bao and the ""Ha gao"".

62,5.0,"We just had a stay over this weekend at W Hotel in the Marvellous room for 2 nights. And it was indeed awesome! Here's what we thought:1. The hotel is doing an excellent job of meeting all the RMCO guidelines, down from the breakfast table to check in. 2. We had requested an early check in but our room wasn't ready due to a late check-out. So we were parked in another room for few hours & given a late check out. This was much appreciated. 3. The Marvellous room is highly recommended. The interiors are so cleverly done & amenities provided are excellent. This holds true for the entire hotel i think.4. Breakfast (buffets on Sundays only) are very good & staff attentive. 5. Spa service was excellent & both of us enjoyed it thoroughly. 6. The Suria mall is just 2 mins away & very convenient. Location of the hotel is superb.Cons, not really, but few constructive feedback:1. Please introduce a small kids menu in in-room dining. My little one didn't have too many options. 2. Water could have been replenished everyday & not just given one time.Overall had a wonderful stay! We would highly recommend it.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

66,5.0,New and modern hotel. Room was clean and well kept. Able to use mobile phone as room key which is great as you don't have to carry the usual key card. Staff friendly and accommodating. Only feedback would be Flock restaurant's music was too loud during the buffet dinner. Music should be just in the background and not overpower table conversation. Otherwise great hotel.,W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
67,5.0,"We really enjoyed our stay in W KL. This is by far one of the most attentive & chic hotel, even before the actual stay itself. Received WhatsApp (not many will go to that extend, mainly using mail) from W Insider - Kristine. She is so friendly & helpful, top notch service. The moment we stepped into W, it was very welcoming from concierge to front desk team. Well done! They have a very fun & chic interior design and pool. My daughter & I love spending our time there, doing people watching, playing with water & all the fun floaters that were available!  Despite having a bath tub in the room. The W Deck drinks were also very creative & nice. My fave was their Suda-Tuak-Ka. Food at Yen was delicious too, we had the buffet dim sum. Only set back was, the view from our room. Was expecting a twin tower view but it was right at the corner. Mainly facing construction area. The sound proof of the room was not too good too. Light sleeper might need an ear plug. But these are all very minor issue. All in all, we had a great staycation. Thanks W KL team for the memories & the tumbler as gift.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
68,5.0,Booked a night stay for my parents and thanks to Meliha for making their stay great!

We loved the amazing Marvelous suite, the top-notch and attentive service, and the exquisite food here. They have enough restaurants and bars, superb activities such as spa, gym and swimming pool in the hotel to make us stay in the hotel. I’d recommend trying the AWAY Spa, Chinese food at YEN and the Sunday Retox Brunch. The other highlight of our stay was the pool overlooking the amazing Twin Towers. Definitely one of the best views in town!",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
71,5.0,"It's quite rare for a chain hotel to have characteristics and charm of a boutique hotel. But W has proven that it is possibleThe room interior is amazing, and the view from the spectacular room is to die foor. Imagine waking up with the petronas twin tower in front of you. 2 queen beds were just perfect for a small family, with aplenty of spaces still available in the roomAmazing service too, considering the hotel industry is struggling, n they probably had to downsize the number of staff. But the quality of the service was unaffected",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Pool area is the best. we had awesome Dinner there at the restaurant and its memorable. foods are delicious and serving attractively. quite expensive but they got best Collection of International and Asian Cuisines.,W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
73,4.0,"Overpriced and overrated. I guess the price is because of the location. I expected more as review from tripadvisor is very good. Unfortunately, I did not get what I expected. Firstly I message their FB to ask for birthday celebration, they send me an email Add to insider ,  so I email, and no reply until the day I arrive. I had also mention it when I did the booking via Agoda stating that I’m celebrating a birthday. Also, nothing. Check in is smooth,  early check in allowed. Then I call to reception to inform about birthday, and they arrange a cake and balloon. Breakfast is dine in, mentioned 9.30 but by 9.50 only they called to inform that there will be delay. Food presentation is good, but taste is so so only. Bed is comfortable , room view is Kl tower, bathtub is not clean properly , I need to wash the bath tub again before use. The hotel also had signs of aging. ",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
74,5.0,"When it comes to a W Hotel, you either will just love it or hate it. There isn't a middle ground. I personally am a fanboy when it comes to the brand. It is loud, fun, with a touch of pampering and glitzy glamour that comes along with it. WKL  is one of my favorite so far. Amazing people, amazing rooms, amazing view an amazing pool and amazing FOOD, (yes i said Food). I will sound like a broken record if I talk about how the room is and how the service is over here. When we come back to a hotel repeatedly, it is somewhere we know that has done it right. Yen and Flock are two amazing F&B outlet. The dimsum is to die for! And Flock has the most amazing breakfast spread. I may rate them the best breakfast in the city? its a very close call but it is on the top of our list. The pool with the amazing view of the towers is the to go place. I rarely spent time by the pool or go for a swim when visiting hotels around KL, but this, I would be able to enjoy the sun a view for hours. What I am looking forward to here is the brunch at dusk! Look forward to our next stay coming up soon and gonna try that and report back. So far, all I heard was wonderful things. Counting down to our next stay and this is one property you wannna check out for sure.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
75,5.0,"I stayed here for a 3D/2N staycation with my boyfriend to celebrate our 1st year together. We chose this hotel cause of its great location in KL City Centre and based on all the great reviews we have read online. We received a pre-arrival email from Kristine (W Insider) and were glad we met her during our check-in. We booked a standard Wonderful Room, but Kristine and Sudhir (Director of Rooms) surprised us with a 5-tier upgrade to their Marvellous Suite... WOW!!! Literally W-O-W!The W Insider team did a fantastic job at arranging cute and romantic amenities for me and my boyfriend. They even set up a handful of colourful helium balloons to further heighten the 'WOW factor'. I had a hard time eating the amenities because they were simply too pretty!The suite was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was spacious and well lit with natural lights. The standalone bathtub was so huge it was screaming for us to throw in a bath bomb ASAP. Floor to ceiling mirrors were aplenty throughout the suite, which complemented all the natural light coming in from all sides of the suite. My partner and I appreciated the simple things of: hot water in the shower, cool aircon throughout the suite, super-duper comfortable beds that let us sink into a well-deserved deep slumber. The hotel is within a 5-min walking distance to KLCC and 5-min taxi ride to Bukit Bintang. The Wet Desk offered the best view of the KLCC from the bar, sunbeds and even inside the pool itself. I have visited their Chinese restaurant in the past (Yen) and it was great, but this time we went to Flock for Breakfast.The spread of Western and Asian cuisine was huge! I simply LOVE rice congee for breakfast. Flock Restaurant offered a wide variety of condiments to add into the rice congee and that was enough to put me in a good mood for the rest of the day. They also served Nasi Lemak for breakfast with Sambal Sotong and tiny Ikan Bilis - I loved it so much! Fresh coconuts from Cameron Highlands were available upon request - how can I say no to that?!My boyfriend and I enjoyed our staycation so much. We would love to come back again in the near future for our next special occasion!",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
76,5.0,"The W Kuala Lumpur is easily one of the best and certainly the greatest value W’s I have had the pleasure of staying with. Of the 50 plus locations in some 25 countries and my wife and I have experienced many past stays at more than 17 W's in some 13 countries throughout Asia, Europe, North, Central and South America as well the Middle East and most frequently at Bali. Over our three night stay, amongst the many standout features of this relatively new hotel opened in August 2018 included -the superb and massive marvellous suite which probably has the best double shower ever;-the excellent and discreet morning and evening housekeeping;-the generous Titanium Elite recognition which includes a full nightly happy hour at 6.30pm with hot and varied snacks;-an exceptional breakfast at Flock with a diverse range of Asian and Western options and -the generally stellar service by the service team notably at the restaurants and entry levelThe GM’s leadership and high standards are very obvious.My only minor criticism of the hotel was that the pool and wet bar staff were less than friendly and seemed preoccupied which is a pity as the pool deck area is a real feature of the hotel.As a casual smoker, I also appreciated the set aside under cover area on a section of the 8th floor terrace.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Their service is bravo, why i said so ? Because when i entered Flock, their staff even is busy to clear table, they still will look at each customers and talk friendly and giving warm services. This is how i feel at their professional services. A good compliment i would like to give a staff named Hanis, because he is the person who recommend the smoked salmon egg benny, haha, he is a friendly person and he know how to give some suggestions to customers to  have a good meal early in the morning.

They had two computers available in the business Center just outside of the conference rooms, but the area was very un-ergonomic, and looked like a front desk.

86,5.0,"I last stayed here about a year ago, and it was such a splendid stay, that I gave a 5 star review then. Decided it was due for another visit just to see has the standards been maintained, and I'm delighted to say, it definitely has. Checked into the Marvelous Suite again, so nothing new to experience, except this time was given a room higher up, so the views are better. Everything is as I remembered it be during my first stay, room is awesome, service is awesome, and this time I decided to spent more of my stay here at the Wetdeck. Nothing beats taking a dip in the pool whilst gazing at the magnificent views of the Twin Towers next door. And at night, the Wetdeck is even more awesome! I didn't get to spend any time here at night during my last stay as it was closed due to some private function. But now I fully understand why the Wetdeck is THE place to be amongst KL-ites on Saturday nights. Breakfast service at Flock is magnificent, just as I remembered it to be. What's even more astonishing is the staffs even remembered us, which is simply amazing considering that our last stay here was more than a year ago! Special shoutout to Wati and Hanis, both of whom went above and beyond to make sure that we had the loveliest of time during the breakfast service. Food was delicious, the pastries especially, are to die for. And me being a cheese addict, sampled every single cheese options on offer, delicious. Mr. Metzner, if you're reading this review, I just wanna say, you're doing a terrific job keeping this establishment at the standards that it is now. It was a wonderful stay.

We arrived before 3pm hoping we can check in early, however we were informed the room wasn't ready and we needed to wait for an hour to an hour and half. We were shocked but the reception was very apologitic, and to compensate us for the inconvenience they gave us voucher for free drinks at the woobar while waiting...after an hour, still our room wasnt ready and i think their manager stepped in and told us they will give us temporary room and we agree. The check in process was a bit slow compared to other Marriott hotels. Anyway, the temp room given was corner room and sooo pretty... we started using the amenities and walked around.. At past 6pm we finally moved to our room.. it was a nice room amd view was fantastic. They allowed us to check out late and they gave us a token for the trouble. Overall, the experience was still pleasant. the staff were friendly and accommodating. Room and facilities were clean. The inroom dining service was indeed 5-star experience.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
91,5.0,"Perfectly situated in the center of KL, across the street from the Petronas Towers, another perfect stay at the W. This was our first stay at this particular property. Very stylish with a modern, artsy, and hip design. The hotel is fairly new; about a year and a half since it’s opening. It still smells like a brand new car!The staff was amazing. High complements go to front desk and restaurant staff. They were so helpful and personable. It made our stay better than I could have imagined. We really had the opportunity to get to know some of the hosts and servers and the service at Flock, which is the main restaurant where breakfast is served. We really enjoyed our conversations with the servers. Even though we didn’t have any personal contact with housekeeping, the service they provided were perfect. They did a great job maintaining our room. I’d also like to mention the friendliness of the Wheels staff who greeted us as we entered and exited the front of the hotel. They made an attempt to be personable as well.  Like I’ve said in other reviews, when you have staff who interact with you anytime they see you, it’s a sign of a well run hotel.The food at the breakfast buffet was excellent. There’s a mix of western and eastern foods. Fresh fruits are plentiful and the restaurant will make you any type of coffee you desire. Flock has indoor and outdoor seating. If the heat isn’t so bad in the morning, I highly recommend dining outside with a view of the Petronas Towers and skyline. It’s also lovely for dinner. Additionally, we had dinner at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel which was exceptional.The fitness center is located on the 8th floor. It offers a variety of cardiovascular and strength training machines, weights, stretch mats, apples and bottles of water. Spectacular view while working out!  Just down the hall is the pool area. There’s not much shade but incredible views of the skyline and during the evening it turns into an outdoor nightclub. The one night we were up there, they had a DJ playing club music. It’s all open-air and absolutely beautiful. You can also order food until midnight.Our room was awesome. Great size with lots of storage space, nice amenities, and floor to ceiling windows. All in room functionality seemed pretty high-tech; turning on and off the lights, closing and opening the shades are illuminated by waving your finger in front of the icon.  It’s something I’ve never seen in other hotels.When we return to KL, this will definitely be our new address due to the high quality of customer service, personal attention, location, and modern amenities this property offers. Thank you for a wonderful visit!",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
92,5.0,"Amazing views of the Petronas Twin Towers from the rooftop. Great food, lovely staff and room service, excellent bar and pool services. So many great spots in and around the hotel to take pictures. Quality of the room was superb! They helped me reheat a food I had brought in from a restaurant the previous day (at no extra cost!) Overall trip and hotel stay experience was worthwhile (money well spent). Definitely recommend.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
93,5.0,Following a disappointing W stay in Singapore this blew us away. Amazing space and breathtaking location. Wet deck was cool to hang out in at night. Staff were super on it and gave great service throughout. We booked a suite which looked out on to the towers. Great recognition as a titanium Marriott member. We will be back soon hopefully. ,W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
94,5.0,"This hotel is faultless, its got a really cool vibe which is evident throughout the hotel.The staff can not do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble.  Need anything just press whatever/whenever on your in room phone.We ate in Woo Bar- snacks,great quality, quirky cocktails with a menu you can throw a dice on to decide what you want!Flock- just fabulous!Wet Deck- we went to a party on the Saturday night, great atmosphere, DJ’s.  Excellent pool service, good choice of food and drink.  The view from the pool is to die for.Had breakfast in bed, again was amazing.It is worth every ringgit, do not hesitate to book!",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
95,4.0,"I have good impression in last 2 stays at W KL and decided to come back again which is not disappointed. As Marriott Ambassador Elite, I have been upgraded to Studio suite which is much bigger than Typical studio room type (if I am not wrong, it is appx 92sqm). Property also offer beyond normal Marriott scheme by giving both complimentary breakfast and 1,000 Bonvoy points which is fantastics. Similar to last time, I enjoyed all session in the property from Front desk, Fantastic Chinese food @ YEN, Woo Bar as well as Breakfast at Flock. Only one comment which I feel very disappointed not only this time but with previous experience as well is at WET deck. I knew this is kind of cool bar for people to have good drink with nice KLCC view but staff behavior is something different from Typical W worldwide standard. I have been in more than 10 W globally including Maldive, Samui, Bali and Hongkong. Everywhere seem to be very famous for tourist but I would say that we always recieve special handicap as In house guest ( I don’t mention on Ambassador status). Unfortunately, it was not happening here. After my Gym time around 4 pm, I ordered Pepsi and need to remind same waiter after wait over 20 mins. Nice time, staff seem to be do not care when we walk in so I decided to move to have silent Drink at Woo Bar instead. I might switch to St regis in next stay. Am I gonna come back to W? Probably yes but may be not at WET deck. ",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
96,5.0,Great stay from the start to the end! We arrived at the hotel in the morning before check in time and was given early check in with a upgraded room to the Spectacular room. Room was beautiful which faces the twin towers. There's enough amenities(even face wash!) in the room so if you are travelling light you won't need to worry. Hotel is close to most places we wanted to go to but beware of the peak hours. Breakfast was excellent with a variety of choices. Overall all the staff were attentive and friendly.,W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

98,5.0,"Where do I even start?! I am still on a hype of how amazing this hotel is! From pre-arrival to the very few seconds of my stay, I'm completely blown away. Kristin, W Insider, was in touch with me days before I arrived and made sure I had a smooth transition from the airport to the hotel. And where my jaw dropped was when I entered my spacious, luxurious room and an awesome, personalized amenity was already waiting for me. That truly was the highlight of the trip and will be forever remembered. Thanks, Kristin!Every staff I encountered was extremely friendly and would even go out of their way to talk to me. I could really sense the W-ness oozing out from each of their talents here. Breakfast was also another superb experience. Richard, Director of Culinary, was always present and took the time to talk to every guest. In all my travels, I always go for the local delicacies even during breakfast… and Flock certainly did not disappoint! Loved the Beef Rendang, Beef Curry and Nasi Lemak. One notable superstar here is, Shoben (I hope I got the name right?), he remembered me from the first day and welcomed me by name, impressed me with his recommendations that I had to try their special breakfast with Foie Gras topped with Kaya (forgot the name, but I mean… the combination of these two IS TO DIE FOR). Towards the end of my breakfast experience, Sathia (Operations Manager) approached my table to make sure if everything is alright and to offer me anything else in the menu. I hope I could stomach more food at that point, but I really couldn’t anymore! It’s just amazing how the team works here.. the attention to detail and their staff is really something notable and worth praising!At check out, Kristin was her fabulous self and waited to bid me farewell. Dholly’s energy was super contagious - I couldn’t help but smile during check out. Had to stop by Woobar before leaving and Darya surprised me with a special drink outside the menu - wow! Finally, while waiting for my ride to leave W with a heavy heart.... Ash and Faris were there to assist me and made sure that I had a memorable farewell. To the GM, Christian Metzner, you sir have done an amazing job with the team here! Kudos to you and the WKL family for setting up the bar. ",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
99,3.0,"I wanted to like this hotel, but it doesn't live up to the hype or the cost.  As we say in Texas - ""All Hat, No Cattle"".  From a practical standpoint who needs 16 different switches by the bedside?  Just keep it simple, I am just here for a night or two - do not want to spend that much time learning what turns what on or off.  The lobby lounge had the music much too loud - I ask them to turn it down so we could hear each other talk and they did - but said that they were going for a ""vibe"".  Guess that vibe is to not have a conversation.  The throw pillows on the beds just made me think - ""I wonder whose germs are on those?""  - might look nice - but a big yuck factor to me.  It does have a location within easy walking distance to the Towers, so if you want to go there it is very easy.  The business center literally had broken couches and the chairs were to low to reach the computers which were at bar level, not desk level.  Very disappointed in our stay.",W Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Occupancy was low so it was less hectic as compared to my previous stays (on weekends).Due to status, got upgraded to a decent room which was spacious and comfortable with a view of the lake (as opposed to the city view which is also quite good if you are into that sort of thing).In general, service was good all round and in particular exceptional at the Exec Lounge - which has at last been opened! Please extend my thanks to the team who have really made the effort to make me feel comfortable. I also had a very interesting conversation with one of the Exec Lounge staff (Mr. Seran) on the evening of the 12th. Breakfast was great again as expected with the chef being extremely cheerful even at 6am. The variety of food looks to be quite decent, should be enough to satisfy everyone's taste.All in all it was overall a good stay and worth the price!On a side/personal note : There was an incident which I brought up to the Manager on Duty that was resolved.

The process were smooth, superb and excellent. Even though there were many people during weekend, the process was fast and the front desk keep smiling and acting professionally. Thumb up to the Front Desk Team. Special thanks to Mr Ronald ( sorry, correct me if i'm wrong) who assist and detailed the hotel info briefly.  Suprizingly he has a great memory and even remember my name and it maybe justify how frequent i'm staying here. Kudos to him personally. Last but no least, late checkout extended was awesome, lovely. The room with open bathtub concept is the one of my best point to keep loyal with Hilton KL. It is totally perfect for relaxation and some much-needed me-time. The tropical nature pool on level 8 was great Trees and small waterfall make u feel relax and cool to stay longer at the pool. Huge shares two pools with the adjacent Le Meridien make it look alike one big ' Oasis in the City'.

12,2.0,"Stayed here for one night as a staycation. With two young kids we were looking for a relaxing change of scenery after being home for so long. Unfortunately a very disappointing stay. Check in was very weird and unprofessional. Check in was 3pm we showed up a but early (our bad) and where told to wait in the lobby and they would let us know when the room was ready. At 3pm still nothing and when asking they said that the room was not ready and they also couldn’t tell us how long it would take. Unacceptable if you’re only there for one night and don’t get access to the facilities until you have your room key. Only after making quite a fuss we got to get the room. Another weird thing is that we booked the grand executive suite, and online while booking it said you had access to the executive lounge for breakfast, but upon checking in they said the executive lounge is not open until 12noon. Hotel was very busy. For the pool there were 30 min. time slots and there just was no logic to it. Couldn’t reserve a time just show up and maybe wait 30/60 min. for a 30 min swim. With two little kids we had hoped for some pool time and slide fun but this was absolute not the case and it’s wasn’t worth the trip. Other small things but all adding up to this negative review: ordered a baby crib, phoned them the night before about it but wasn’t ready in the room. They brought out roll away bed so it had to get changed. Arrived without blankets, called for blankets. Waited for 1.5 hours, nothing. Phoned again...Positive was that the room was specious and the Japanese restaurant onsite was really good. Great quality and service there!",Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

18,3.0,"Front Desk:Special thanks to Mr Shahril who assist on the check-in & check-out and detailed hotel info was briefed. Late checkout extended by the team member too. Room:Spacious, contemporary design and nice view. Wide range of channels for the TV too. There are some missing amenities such as pen & paper note, slippers and only 1 bathrobe. However, not important as I not really need it. Bathroom with bathtub is my favourite part, where you can actually watch the TV while enjoying your soak due to the open concept design of the bathroom. No worries if you need some privacy as there are doors to close off the bathroom too. Pool:Crowded pool due to high demand which is understandable. However, the limitation of the number of pax in the pool is not consistent. The guests are allowed to come in when the pool is crowded but not allowed when the number of pax is visible lesser. The official number of pax allowed in the pool is 20 pax. Overall, the stay is satisfying but arrangement for special occassion can be improved. Advance request placed but it's not carried out completely and hotel asked for kind understanding without reason and apology which make the situation pretty upset. Eventually, they waived off the decoration charge as compensation but I would rather it to be done than waiving off the charges since it's a special occasion.Lastly, Jay from housekeeping is very polite too and greeted us nicely upon checking-out :)",Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

24,3.0,"Been a while since we stayed in this hôtel and was super excited to stay here for a 'Gourmet Staycation'. One of the highlight was that we can choose to have dinner in Vasco's. What a major disappointment. Yes, we understand that there's no buffet, however, the ala carte menu is simply disappointing. It was not worth the extra we paid. And the taste, it could be better for this hôtel. I could not even finish my pasta. It was that bad. Ordered a hot chocolaté, tasted like the instant version. Left a bad taste in my mouth. I am not so sure what's with this package. Ever since we checked-in, this hôtel wanted to charge us extra. Lucky for us, we have our booking confirmation in hand, else they wanted to charge us higher. Also, in the restaurant, know your right that you can receive 25% off on food. They wanted to charge the full price. It was a mess. Don't get me started on the service. Thank goodness for the pool. We had a wonderful time relaxing by the pool. It's really huge and that's only because they share it with the hôtel next door. I would say this pool is the highlight of our trip. Can't comment much on the room. I had a suspicion that we are short changed because we took the package. The room that we usually stayed in feels larger. All in all, be careful when you choose the 'Gourmet Staycation'. Don't put your expectations too high or you'll be disappointed. And know your entitlements. ",Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

30,3.0,"It was a great staycation at Hilton KL during last valentine's day. My girlfriend and I enjoyed staying in the spacious clean room that equipped with a nice bathtub. Due to Movement Control Order (MCO), most of hotel facilities are closed and breakfast is served in-room(pre-selected meal upon check-in and up to guest's time preference). Overall it was a great experience despite limited access to hotel facilities and few hiccup. Unfortunately, I'm dissapointed with the hotel's hospitality. I have enquiry on handphone charging cable from the reception and the staff on duty that night failed to get back to me. Besides,  breakfast is served late (not as our pre-booked serving time) and only when we called and ask for it, not to mention the incomplete cutlery inside the pre-pack breakfast set! I then checked again on the charging cable with the staff (who sent our meal) and nothing happen nor action taken until our check-out. A simple yes or no will suffice and you don't keep hotel guest waiting for an answer with no response! I'm really disappointed with the 3 star hospitality service, despite being a globally recognizable brand in hotel franchise industry.",Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

They also changed their protocol with their breakfast buffet, by providing you a schedule where you can have your breakfast, this way they would prevent overcrowding of guests in the buffet area.Overall, it was a great short stay at Hilton, will definitely go again hopefully when the conditions are better.",Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
32,5.0,"KL Hilton has been my favourite staycation venue in Kuala Lumpur. Recently, me and my family booked a couple of rooms for a weekend get away. The rooms have been allocated nicely to our convenience. Due to CMCO,  we couldn't experience our breakfast and evening cocktail in the Executive Lounge. Both were served at the alternative restaurant and lounge bar.  The breakfast experience was alright. However, the evening cocktail services and food varieties can be improved especially at this alternative venue. Also, it is best to have a Hilton Honors counter for the convenience of the members. Overall, through my previous experiences staying in KL Hilton before, I am happy with the services and facilities there.

After almost 10 hours of parking I just realized that there is no discount if I enter using Touch N Go card. I had been charged more than RM100 after almost 10hours of parking. It's almost half of my room rate! Imagine that if I go out the next day or few days later? Does the hotel realize how nonsense it is?At the first place there is no warning sign of using the Touch N Go at the parking entrance especially for the hotel guest that at least will stay for a night. Furthermore, there was no information or explanation at all regarding the parking fee during checking-in. After complaining to concierge, they said they won’t compensate the amount charged on my Touch N Go card.

54,1.0,I booked a 2Nights 3days stay at the Hilton KL Executive Suite with access to the Executive Lounge. Upon my arrival at check in was only when I was told the lounge at Level 33 is temporary closed and they have moved their cocktail to one of their bars and breakfast to the main restaurant called Vasco. We did not mind much but we were certainly disappointed. And true enough in the evening when we went for the cocktail the service was so poor and bias and they platter was horrible. Food for the birds I can say. The food quantity was so Lil and the quality was so bad. What's worse is when we asked for refill of our wine the waitress was so rude. She literally ignored me when I asked for a refill and showed me her hand to wait. She later said there was no red wine when the red wine was on the bar in front of us. They admitted they were under staffed but that does not warrant rude behavior. Overall I felt Hilton was paying me at mercy to stay but the fact is I spent RM900 for 2nights. There is a reason we choose Executive lounge because we like that executive feeling. But this was a rip off.  They were not been honest with the customer which is very wrong.  And the next morning the Q to the breakfast was so long.  No executive feeling at all. Horrible. Very disappointed. ,Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

By 3.30pm finally managed to checkin, but was told the room is ready but awaiting inspection and will take ‘few minutes’.An hour and half later at 5pm, room is not ready and no one bothered to inform. When asked was told they will call me when room is ready. I asked for a time estimate - was curtly told that they will call when room is ready.6 hours later, still no call. By 11pm, I gave up the wait and approached the front office, and voila, they say the room is available all along!The receptionist generously offered a ‘3pm checkout’ to which I declined. Don’t want that to be the reason for another guest having to wait 9 hours for a room.For perspective, I'm an Honors Gold member (and Marriott Titanium, IHG Spire) - so I am generally very tolerant of mistakes. But an almost 9 hours wait for a room is the longest I ever had in any hotel.

I was informed that the kitchen has stopped accepting orders. I argued that we have checked and was informed last order’s 715pm. The staff refused to accept our explanation and we left. We complained to the hotel manager and HPC to be told that they couldn’t extend the vouchers. We didn’t ask for vouchers extension. I was complaining about the bad service but the respond was ‘we couldn’t extend the voucher’. Literally. Which part of my email asking for voucher extension??!  And the so-called hotel manager insulted us further by offering a 25% discount on food on our next visit. Are you high on substance? Without your goodwill, I can still get 25% discount using my credit card benefits or up to 45% with other promotion. Upon realising his mistake, he offered to ca to which I declined.

In the current pandemic, of course when many amenities of Hilton has seen better days and while falling short now; however, the expectations were bridged eloquently by these two gentlemen - - Manager Mr. Adli and Chef Brett. Both gentlemen were omnipresent to our dining experience in Chambers Grill on the recent 14th Nov (2020) evening.

I did have a couple of issues during the first few days of my stay but Gagan, the hotel manager has had everything sorted out, and I have not encountered any further issue thus far. It is a good time to stay at Hilton as the rate is now really low, compared to before the pandemic hits the globe. Hilton also offers attractive long term stay benefit, which includes dining discounts. The messaging feature that the hotel provides is really excellent too. The reply is very prompt and action is also taken immediately if required. I would like to thank both Zafrul and Nik specifically for helping me with all my requests and issues during my stay. Zafrul has been really helpful (he replies almost immediately)- when I smelled some weird scent on the floor that I stay, he immediately came with the air freshener kit for the corridor and the smell disappeared immediately. Nik on the other hand has offered to help me to go to Chynna to place my order for in room dining, when he doesn’t need to (and he could’ve told me to go to Chynna on my own), that was very thoughtful of him to do that. I would also like to thank Omar for being thoughtful and thorough. I remember that I had a brief conversation with him at the front desk asking about laundry and also the bath indulgence menu, and when I sent a message to the team to get someone to collect my laundry, the house keeping staff also brought the bath indulgence menu with him (he mentioned that he was informed by Omar to do so)! Dino from the concierge team has been nothing but helpful to me. I have been doing some shopping here and there. Everytime when I walk in to the hotel with some shopping bags on my hand, he would take the initiative to ask me if I need help to get the stuffs to my room. I think overall, I have had a pleasant stay. It is quiet at night that I can sleep very well; food is delicious at the outlets here; staffs are really helpful and kind (from concierge, front desks, to housekeeping).

I could see a long strand of hair on the clean hanging towel near the bathtub. YUCKS! Charging delivery fees for in room dining order (on top of overpriced menu) and each time we request for ice bucket is ridiculous. Breakfast buffet are limited to one hour of dining during RMCO with almost no social distancing SOP. I’m pretty sure the gap between my table & next table is LESS THAN 1 meter. I overheard next table conversation mentioning he saw someone with pink wristband (quarantine band) was at the buffet breakfast area the previous day.

Our kids were in the tub, with the sliding door ajar,which is right next to the main door!Our young children were in shock having a stranger standing at the door!!!Following the incident and after 3 calls, a housekeeping manager came up to our room to address the issue with the reason that the staff actually went to the wrong room. Unacceptable & absurd excuse!Feeling unjustified, we spoke to a Duty Manager at the reception, who committed that the incident will be escalated. We waited all day till our check out day, the next day and no one had the courtesy to revert to us or even to follow up. On our way out, ONLY when we ask, another manager attended to us  claimed and insisted that after their ""apparent"" investigation, they find that their staff DID practise the sop before entering our room!There were 4 of us with 4 pair of ears, in the room. It is absolutely impossible that we could have missed the door bell! As i am writing this, i cant help feeling our rights and privacy being seriously violated. And all this, took place in such a reputable and international hotel, HILTON KL. I managed to reach out to the hotel management to further investigate this matter.

It was a good experience on how every hotel deal with the current pandemic.What I like :-The staggered breakfast session. During check in, you have to choose your slot. 3 slots available with one break for sanitize session. This made me feel confident that they really taking things seriously.What can be improved :-They should apply the same format for the swimming pool. Pre determined the slot, limit no of people in the pool and allocate time for sanitisation. Please ensure only properly attired guests are allowed in the pool. To have those with Jersey, shirts were big NO. You don't even know how clean are their clothes when they entered the pool.It will be better... If they provide mask, wipes or pocket sanitizer in the room. This will be handy for the guests. Sanitizer was provided in the room but it was a big one.What impressed me was the chat service. Most of the 5 stars hotel will have this service. But I have to compliment the person in charge - AKMAL.

From LRT, MRT, KTM, monorel, you named it.. and of course buses and taxi too. As you have the upper hand on public transport here, definitely a very good place for tourist to stay while connected to most of local attractions around kuala lumpur.As for the room, it was spacious and clean and provided with channel tv, air-conditioned, fridge, iron board and kettle. The bed was so comfy, i could sleep there like a log. Toilet also spacious with bathtub and separated shower. Water pressure was good along with hot water, i was cleansed.. however, i wonder why they put that square desk in front of tv, as i found it not really useful and space wasting.The only down part here is the carpark. Only 2 level of carparks were provide and took us almost 40 minutes just to park our vehicle. Maybe it was because of public holiday but it give us some stress at the beginning of our staycation. The other thing was check in time, took us almost an hour but can't brag much as they follow SOP of covid.The pool was big and nice, but no kids pool provided here.. and i really love the covid SOP for using pool, it make pool less crowded with people and everyone can enjoy their time, uncrowded for 45 minutes. They should apply this even when covid-free.It was an excellent stay except that carpark.. but we should revisited during off peak time to test that carpark again.Overall, great stay, lovely room, great location, friendly staff and worth money. I definitely could come here again..",Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

86,5.0,"The KL Hilton shows you what can happen when you hire good people, invest in their training and then lead by personal example. It is a great quality hotel with world class customer service. Staying in hotels during the Covid pandemic has really shown the good from the bad. This hotel has strict safety and hygiene policies in place - right from the lobby arrival. This gives you confidence that they will keep you safe and takes away some of the current stress we are all feeling (examples - individually wrapped towels and bath robes, even the TV remote control is sterilised and plastic wrapped for hygiene) What makes this place such a hit for me is the quality of the staff and the level of customer service. Every single staff me ever whom i interacted with made me feel special. Front desk, housekeeping, restaurants, even the contract security guards do a good job. They live and breathe to make the guests feel like treasured family members. How many times have you met a hotel GM standing a front-of-house shift with his team on a weekend? And Mr Gagan even took time out of his busy schedule to make small talk with the guests. I met other senior managers doing the same (Mr Christopher - whom i think was the new Operations manager?) That’s real leadership.I enjoyed the hotel Breakfast - which is a buffet with multiple options (western, indian, chinese, malay) Again the safety is paramount and they have a system in place to ensure guests are kept socially distanced while enjoying a relaxing meal. Despite the many staff working in masks and gloves they still have the positive energy to bring humour to their work so that you can feel it is a happy team. I wish i knew their names.l to thank them all personally.Of those staff I met and can remember: Mr Kazi the executive chef was working hard on a new menu with his team - but he still took time to seek out my feedback on the tastes. (it was yummy)Rizky, Jim, Priya, Juliyanna, and interns Ethan, Dinesh - and sorry I forgot the Korean lady’s name - take care of the guests in the executive lounge. I highly recommend upgrading to get lounge access in this hotel. It’s worth every penny with free flow drinks and sunset canapé style snacks from 1800-2000 each evening. The view over lake gardens is worth it! Other facilities - the pool, gym and spa - are all open. (Spa has limited choices currently) And i tried several of the on site restaurants (which i will review separately but definitely Chyna restaurant was a highlight. It is the best run hotel in town.

I booked a 4 nights stay at the Hilton KL and upon check in, I was warmly greeted by Mr Harvin, the manager manning the check in. I was also acknowledged as a Diamond Honors member and was accorded an upgrade to a marvellous room overlooking the lake garden. The room itself was just perfect with a king sized bed, a table to work on, a lounge chaise located to the huge window offering a majestic view of KL’s lung. Linens were prepacked in boxes to ensure its cleanliness, in line with Hilton’s hygiene plege to its guests. I was also allowed access to the lounge of the 33rd floor and the staff there were just pleasant .. Ms Julyanna and Mr Jim. They took care of me during my visit to the lounge and even addressed me by my name - which surprised me as I only frequented the lounge during the evenings. Evening snacks at the lounge comprise of a selection of sandwiches, fruits, salad plates, pastries and a hot selection. Drinks included juice, soft drinks, tea and coffee and for those who fancy, a selection of alcoholic drinks.  Breakfast was served buffet style at the restaurant and this was very much welcomed as you had the pleasure of selecting yourself what you desire to eat. There were strict SOPs although breakfast was served buffet style. Check out was a breeze also and was done at the lounge.

I must say it was the best idea we had in a long while. All of us (8 of us in total) had a blast there. The hotel is magnificent and grand. The rooms are refurbished, large and very clean and best of all the staff at this hotel are all amazingly friendly and helpful. Each and everyone of them - but two people stood out for me and that is Mr. Syamim from Front Desk and Ms. Komathy from F&B (Coffee House). They went beyond the norm of service to ensure that my family and I and all the other guests there were happy and well taken care of. Sunway Putra hotel is superbly located in the heart of the city and is adjoined to the Putra Mall which means shopping is just an elevator/lift away...lolFor a superb, 5-star break in the heart of the city and for helpful friendly faces from their staff - Sunway Putra Hotel is by far one of my most memorable stay you could have.

Check-in was a bit hectic because of an event in PWTC; a lot of people checking in and out. Lines were long. But I went for lunch as soon as I got there. 2 hours later, my room was still not yet ready. I booked for a Deluxe Suit, because of the long wait, they upgraded my room to Family Room instead! Yeay! Thanks SPH! The buffet was great! The Mee Kari was unforgettable! I wish I had more room to stomach that Mee Kari! Haha! Will definitely be back for that Mee Kari. The Western Breakfast was my daughter's favorite. The staffs were very accommodating for a family with little ones like me. I like that they followed the SOP in using the pool where we have to book 2 hours earlier to use it. But, when we were swimming, suddenly a huge crowd came rushing in. I doubt they ever booked their time to use the pool because it was surely more than 10 people at one time already. SPH should monitor closely on this. I force my family to go back to our room as soon as the pool got a bit crowded.I did request for an extra laundry bag but it didn't come. I had to purchase plastic bags outside myself.The lifts are superb! Though it was an old installation but it is very fast and well maintained. Good job SPH!Other than that, it was a pleasant stay.

But the tables are all for 2 pax only 6) Free parking ( don’t use Touch&Go when you enter the parking)The CONs (or maybe just a minor improvement would be great )1) Too bad we can’t enjoy the swimming pool due to the CMCO (looking forward to it actually )2) I had Nasi Lemak for breakfast this morning, the rest is fine just the Fried Chicken was a bit to  hard to bite on (overnight cooking I presume )If you want to find a place to stay in KL, this place is highly recommended!

We requested several things from housekeeping and I'd say I am impress with their fast service. They also called us to check whether we received our items.

Upon check out, we were greet by Mr. Idris and we had a chit chat about the hotel. Mr. Idris told us about the promotion on going at the hotel and surely will stay here again.Other than that, the hotel's location is very convenient and the hotel attach to shopping mall (cinema, restaurants, groceries, etc) so you can shop till your drop and rest at the hotel after that.

The mall beside the hotel has many restaurants which makes us more convenient whenever we want to find stuffs to eat. However, one thing i don;t really like is there is no eating place for breakfast since all restaurant opens at 10am, this force me to take a breakfast in the hotel if I do not want to go other further places for breakfast.Overall, i love the hotel room and location.

Location is good and PWTC LRT station is 2-3mins only by walk. There are covered link bridge to Sunway Putra Mall and you can walk from the Mall to hotel also. The mall is just beside the hotel and linked to each other, therefore there is no problem for food and shopping.Stayed here during the Covid-19 period and hotel has limited housekeeping and facilities to use. The pool is closed but the gym is opened by appointment. However, this is for the safety for all guests and staff.Although you may need to call and ask for housekeeping, but the housekeeping lady still come to ask in the morning if you are in the room. If you not making request, she will not enter and housekeeping for you. In the bathroom, the items provided is basic only, but you can call to ask for cotton buds, toothbrush set etc. So, not an issue if you forget to bring any.However, hotel will still provide you with drinking water, tea, toiletries etc when you call and ask from them. The staff will send to you within 5 minutes. After that, the call center staff will confirm if you had receive the items you ask for. This is a great service and I very appreciated for it.Well, only downside I can think of is the window is slight small. My room (deluxe twin room) is like a 2 panels window only.

The reception staffs were all helpful and was calm despite it was chaos at the lobby area.Special mention to Sudhir the security stationed outside, I asked for a mineral water which I understand only available in the room or else need to purchase but Sudhir went the extra mile to go in and got me a mineral water even after telling him I don’t need it anymore.

4,5.0,"We took advantage of the weekday promotion with breakfast and stayed for 4 nights. The breakfast was great but due to the Covid Pandemic, it has to be staggered to avoid overcrowding. The breakfast is great and with ample selection. Since only 2 time slots allocated, the wait time for breakfast can be a bit long. Maybe if there are 4 time slots of 1 hour each may help to cut down peak waiting time. The room was clean, comfortable and safe. The staff were great, very helpful, responsive and courteous. There were minor housekeeping issues but was speedily resolved by Duty Manager (Encik Hasli) and Housekeeping Manager (Puan Adi). The pool is nice too. Location is great, near to many tourist attractions and public transportation hub. For those who enjoy morning or evening walks/jogs, there is a nice Lake Gardens nearby. Parking is a flat rate of RM15 per day but need to be careful since sometimes it charges 2 per day which happened to us twice. Nevertheless, we truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return here for future staycation. ",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

6,4.0,"I initially booked with their sister hotel (Hotel Stripes) but was relocated to Majestic Hotel as Hotel Stripes remain closed despite that they accepted the booking. The e mail informing me of the relocation was rather last minute 1.5 days prior to departure. Needless to say this little incident was rather unsatisfactory as we made plans around Hotel Stripes (restaurant bookings within the vicinity that is walking distance) and being left in the limbo at the eleventh hour. However Natasha Kok from Majestic's reservation did an excellent job in pacifying me and sorted out the room confirmation and ensuring that i was provided with the room and dining privileges on par with what i booked with Hotel Stripes. In fact, i would like to commend that she went above and beyond and exceeded expectations entirely in ensuring customer satisfaction. This happened to be my third stay with Majestic Hotel and it is their impeccable and exemplary services such as this that they will always have in my books as one of my recommended choice of Hotel for KL. Rest assured that you have my loyalty and return patronage.Hotel rooms are clean and tastefully furnished although some deep cleaning and minor touch up should serve the hotel well since it has been operational for many years. Buffet breakfast has a smaller spread compared to pre covid times but it is adequate.Doorman to front desk service were top notched as always.

9,1.0,"On 5th March, we have enquired about organising a birthday celebration at the Colonial Cafe in Majestic Hotel on 13th March. Upon receiving their high tea menu, and taking into consideration that it includes the following items in the menu: Mille Feuille, Basque Burnt Cheesecake, Opera Cake, Florentine and Salted Caramel Eclair, we have decided to proceed with the plan and made a booking to have the high tea menu.On 13th March, instead of being served as per the menu, we were served an assorted type of cakes and instead of receiving 5 different types of desserts, we have only received 4 types of assorted cakes and when we enquired about the type of cakes, it took numerous waiters to come by our table before they could provide an explanation on the type of cakes we were having and the reason for the change of menu. This is such a disappointment, as we were induced to organise our high tea birthday celebration due to the agreed menu, and when there is a changed of the menu, we were not informed though we have only made the bookings a week earlier. There is a clear misrepresentation in the menu when we were promised 5 desserts servings, but we have only received 4 desserts. More importantly, i hope the management realised that assorted type of cakes are a lot more inferior and cheap as compared to the complexity of making Mille Feuille, Basque Burnt Cheesecake, Opera Cake, Florentine and Salted Caramel Eclair. The worst part is, most of the waiters did not know and care about what they were serving as when we enquired about the type of cakes, no one seem to know the answer! I did not pay the service of a 5 star hotel to receive a road side service, neither did I choose to pay for good quality pastries and desserts, but then found out on the day of arrival that they have decided to change it to some inferior cakes without thinking that they need to inform their customers. Your menu has clearly misrepresented and induced us to pay for something that we did not want. Had we knew earlier that there was a change in menu, we would not have hold our birthday party at Majestic Hotel. Such a let down on the service level and product quality. It still baffles me that a 5 star hotel would swap 5 premium Mille Feuille, Basque Burnt Cheesecake, Opera Cake, Florentine and Salted Caramel Eclair, with 4 assorted cakes.

10,3.0,"1. February and March 2021 has been very hot, and that calls for a staycation. My stay was upgraded to The Majestic KL as The Stripes remains closed.2. Check-in took a little long. People took advantage to have a staycation since 6-7 March was the first weekend since MCO was lifted. The reception was fully staffed.3. I was given a corner room. The room was very comfortable, and the bathroom was fantastic. I loved the standalone tub. However, not all amenities were provided. I had to call Housekeeping for face towels. The shampoo & bath gel still contain methylparaben.4. That being said, the room was showing its age. A portion of the wallpaper had peeled off, and one of the mirror lights malfunctioned. The plastic portion of the lampshades are cracked, but it didn’t render the lamps useless. The picture quality for the TV in the bathroom was not as good as the main TV. There was a red stain on one coffee cup. There were some stains on the white curtains.5. The bedding was impeccable. The linens and the pillows were so plush you don’t want to leave the bed once you’re tucked in.6. I was given an impromptu mini hotel tour by Sharezal, the Director of Concierge. I learned a lot from his explanations. I can see his passion and enthusiasm in highlighting what a great hotel this is. It was the highlight of my staycation.7. The gym was well equipped. The exercise machines are all from Technogym. However, my key card was not working, and I had to go down to the Reception to get it sorted out. The receptionist went back to the gym with me to ensure that I can enter the gym. That was a nice gesture.8. There’s a water ponding issue in the shower room. Not all water is drained after you take a shower.9. The breakfast service on the weekend took place at Contango. It was a buffet service, and at least 10 chefs were working at the live stations. The foods were delicious and of high quality. I can see that the patrons were well taken care of.10. However, that was not the case on Monday (8 March). The set menu served breakfast at the Colonial Cafe. Excited to dine at a fine venue, I was left disappointed by the issues at the kitchen. I saw the wrong orders were sent to a couple of tables. My guest also had her order wrongly sent.11. My breakfast finally arrived after 90 minutes of waiting. That was a ridiculous amount of waiting time. However, the waiting team was apologetic, and the food arrived fresh and hot. I was one of the last patrons to leave the Colonial Cafe when the waiting team was already preparing the lunch tables.12. Overall, it was an average stay. It would have been a great one had the Service level at the Colonial Cafe was as good as at the Contango.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

The breakfast buffet spread at Contango, and lunch/dinner menu at Colonial Cafe were limited but sufficient nonetheless for us.  The only grouse we had was the long wait to check in.  We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and only got our room at 8pm (seemed as though the whole of Klang Valley was also there for a staycation that weekend).  Staff said they would call when our room was ready but they never did.  They were not even apologetic about the unusually long wait.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
14,4.0,"We stayed at the junior suite. It was really nice and spacious. Can’t fault anything, everything was lovely. Staff were courteous and helpful at all time. Everything went super well, just like our previous stay. Until, the time we wanted to book the pool. Understandable that we need to follow the SOP during this RMCO. But the management should be wary of some KIASU guests who just simply book slots but didn’t bother to turn up hence denying other guests opportunities to enjoy the pool. And given the limited space, why can’t the management allow those staying at the new wing to use the always empty pool in front of the spa. Afterall we are all paid guests under the same hotel. Why just want to reserve that pool for few guests who apparently don’t want to use it? Then came breakfast. It was quite chaotic. Understandably there were many guests but it was not as if it just happened. Management should have come up with a plan to make sure guests don’t have to wait in a very long Q just to get their eggs, for example. It’s acceptable if it was just a 3 star hotel but.... And I would like to echo the previous reviewer. The parking fee was just ridiculous. As paid guests, you’ll need to fork out RM14 for each day of stay. In our case, we checked out at 4pm and need to pay for 2 days parking ie RM28. So that’s RM14 for that extra 2 hours.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

It was hard to get the slot. Also the pool depth is 1.2m which is not children-friendly. Not advisable to go if you have small kids. Breakfast buffet is not available until further notice. I stayed for 2 nights and i was charged rm14x3 days parking. When i asked the front counter staff, she said all other hotels also charge for parking.

17,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3D2N stay at this luxurious, colonial YTL hotel. We love its proximity to the Botanical Gardens – easy access to lush, greenery despite being in busy, busy KL.  Our room was spacious and grand from all points. We were especially impressed by the bathroom – with beautiful black marble flooring and a lavish bath-tub set in the middle facing the TV.  Our stay had breakfast included. On Sunday it was buffet breakfast with quite a wide selection of choices. On Monday it was ala-carte . But portions were big. We made friends with Chef Zaidi. His nasi lemak with rendang chicken is a must-try. The hotel has a beautiful Orchid Conservatory where we could have had afternoon tea but we did not book in advance. Sigh.  Another time perhaps.Due to MCO we opted not to go to the pool. We worked out in the gym which is pretty well-equipped. Due to MCO we did not go to the spa either. Our thanks to the friendly and helpful staff and special thanks to Front Office Manager, Mr. Marcus Tam. We appreciate that you went out of your way to assist and please anyway you could.

18,3.0,"We stayed at The Majestic on the last week of Dec 2020, between Christmas & New Year. Despite being a weekday, the hotel was almost fully booked, which is great to see for business, especially during these trying times.The check in process was smooth, although long queue. Front desk employee Phoebe (i think) was nice & accommodating. It was a pleasant experience.The room was nice & beautifully decorated, although starting to show signs of aging. Room 511 has some floor tiles in the bathroom which are broken, but thats not really a big deal. In general, we were happy with the condition of the room. The beds & pillows were comfy and provided us with sound sleep, which is great.Being a colonial hotel, the place (especially the Majestic Wing) has lots & lots of photo-opp areas. The reception at the Maj Wing, with its golden dome is just breathtaking. But my favorite is the Orchid Conservatory, it simply took our breaths away.However, all the pleasant experience faded when we visited The Colonial Cafe for dinner. Service was terrible for us. We kept noticing a few guests who arrive later than us were served & got their orders faster than us. And I'm sorry to say this but I just cant help noticing, those guests who received their orders faster than us are mostly white. It makes me feel sad that we were quickly downgraded to the bottom of the list just because we're local? The food was good, by the way. Its just that the service was rather poor.Similarly, the breakfast service at Contango didnt give us a particularly pleasant experience either. Selection wasnt that good, which wasnt a big deal for me, but what I cant accept is that there was only 1 person to man the drinks counter. The same person had to make coffee, take orders, prepare orders etc since the guests are not allowed to take their own drinks. The biggest shame was that the other employees, who were not really busy at that time, didnt feel the need to chip in & help the poor guy who's obviously struggling to meet the demands (and the queue).These two experiences at Colonial & Contango has ruined our experience and for that, we've decided not to visit The Majestic again.

However, I have been experiencing dissapointing experience from the start. The check in was so bad that I had to wait in Q for almost an hour, and come on, not even a welcome (or apology) drink or something? After came in the room, we were welcomed by an annoying humming sound came in from somewhere that I had to call downstairs to check it out, turn out something related to their piping issue. Only 1 towel and no floor mat in the room, again need to call them to send it in. We came straight from Johor Bahru and was starving and we decided to try their in-room dining service since its Majestic right? Oh my God, it was the worst decision ever! Not only the food was so overpriced consider the serving portion was so little, they even sent the wrong food. I was forced to wait another 30 mins for them to send me the right food (I know u recycled the previous rice since I ordered Black Pepper beef rice and the rice given to me was the japanese rice from earlier wrong order).At the time of writing (just finished the not so majestic in-room dinner), I'm still here and really hope tomorrow morning's breakfast can save the day/trip, finger crossed.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

Feel sticky on the floor when I step on it. The room was not properly cleaned as I found toothpick under table lamp. Seriously. There were no towels too so I call the room service and rectify these issue. They came and clean the fridge brought the towel. I also request for extra blanket from through the Marriott apps but none of my request being fulfilled. So I call the service once, twice and trice but nothing was sent.

So, on our special day (ROM at 12.12), we have decided to checked in into this hotel to make our day extra special.Even though we arrived at the hotel rather late at 7pm , our room wasn’t even ready yet (check in time supposedly to be 3pm). Front desk staff promised the room to be ready in 1.5 hours as the hotel was running at full capacity, shorthanded of housekeeping staff & coupled with their nice offer for late check out at 4pm.After learning from other hotel guests (a group family) who has been waiting for more than 4 hours, we approached the front desk again & they needed another 1 hour (from initial 8.30pm delayed to 9pm). Therefore, we have decided to head out to grab some dinner before the restaurants closed as we were hungry. Upon our return at 10pm, we were appalled that our room was still not available & was told to wait for another 30minutes. We weren’t happy & was very disappointed. Phoebe (front desk officer on duty) was super accommodative and got our room ready (all in less than 10 mins). Whilst we appreciate the waived room charges, we’d hope the management can seriously look into beefing up the housekeeping team esp when the property is running at full capacity.

Said it was fully booked, but after we asked repeatedly for her to check, a slot at 8pm was suddenly available (means she didnt check when we initially asked?). We ordered food from Grab (bcs we had an inkling the dine in service would be poor judging from the check in service) but we requested for some plates and cutleries. The plates were only delivered after 2 HOURS and about 10 follow up calls, which was absolutely ridiculous that it took so long just to send up some empty plates! The pool was empty so not sure why the receptionist said it was fully booked, and there was no personnel there to help us with the towels etc. Left to fend for ourselves. Breakfast was also terrible, it was a serviced buffet (understandable due to COVID SOPs) but choices were limited. Food was served cold and wait staff was not helpful.

And after that, we realized that the toilet seat was also dirty with dead insect bodies stuck onto the toilet seats. I would not imagine a hotel with such prestige like yours to actually be so dirty. Next, the air conditioner is not working - it is faulty, we called for an electrician to come around 10pm and fix it and he said the valve was spoilt. The worst thing, my son and I were suddenly having red spots which we are not sure if it is because of the carpets or the cleanliness of the sofa or the bathtub. Even the bedsheets had stains on it..

Upon check in, I was told that housekeeping service is only available upon request. Hence, I interpreted this as, unless I request for the service, otherwise, no one will come over to clean my room. However, I guess the housekeeping team is really eager to do their job  despite mentioning many times that I do not need housekeeping service, they never failed to show up, ring my doorbell 4 mornings during my stay -which I take it as a miscommunication between front desk and housekeeping. Colonial cafe’s food is not that great, while I didn’t appreciate the service that I first received, I do want to thank Sunil for taking ownership of what has happened, and offered a better service during my afternoon tea at the orchid sanctuary. Besides the delicious and reasonably priced afternoon tea, the part that I really like about this hotel is the great concierge team that they have. Concierge team is very knowledgeable and very kind.

When we checked in, all the tables were covered with full of dust. The gaps between on phones were dreadful. When I cleaned them with wipes, I could see black dust all over. I just cleaned by myself. The toilet bowl was ABSOLUTELY disgusting. Only middle of the toilet bowl has been cleaned for a long time, the side/edge of the toilet bowl was completely black, layered with pooh basically. I called the housekeeping and she tried to clean it with a towel. I told her she needs cleaning tools and some kind of liquid and she went to get them. She still cleaned the toilet bowl in the middle only and I had to point out the edges and she realised what I meant. It was not acceptable. It seemed like it hasn't been cleaned properly for months. It was literally disgusting. In room dining service was dreadful too. I ordered the caesar salad comes with chicken satay but it came with 6 pieces of tomato, 4-6 lettuce leaves and boiled egg. I called them back and they said the chicken will be delivered immediately but 2 tiny sticks of chicken came 20 mins later. As I was going out, I had to eat the salad and chicken separately and they charged me 70RM something like that. I just paid. Also, the hotel website advertised the special promotion, a free night in Malacca Majestic but they didn't include terms and conditions in the website. If I had know, the free night is only available during week days, I have booked the hotel from different website. I could have used a free night voucher. When I checked out, they gave me the gift certificate and it was stated ""Weekdays, Sunday to Thursday, until 20th December"". I called the hotel it was a false advertisement and it was not right to charge more money for the package if I couldn't use it. The staff on the phone said they can't do anything about it and he said ""You still have a lot of time so you can use it"", which means I have to take a time off from work to go to Malacca in the middle of the week?Also, the room is right next to the main roads. You can hear terrible traffic noises all night. Majestic doesn't meet 4-5 star hotel category and I would recommend to go to different hotels in KL.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
45,4.0,"Came here for a night stay.Unfortunately paid extra compared to others as we didn’t realise there a package and offers.Future travelers please check the website and available promotions.The hotel it self is wonderful.Check in check out was fast.Lobby was clean.Just one concern when we came there the bell boy passed us without offering to even carry our bags. In the end we had to carry it all the way to 9th floor but it’s ok.The parking: Vallet parking : Rm 40 per day ( acceptable )Normal hotel parking ( Rm 14/ day- cashless , only touch & go ( min rm 20 balance you should have in the card, and also received credit card and debit cards) - unacceptable as it’s the hotel parking and should gv discount or a flat rate or even free for staying in guest.Imaging if you wanna stay for 10 days so you have to pay for each day.Even 5 star hotels don’t charge for parking these days.Room:It was spacious, clean.Bed was comfortable, pillow was nice.Good ambience.Toilet was an open concept but they have sliding glass door with curtains for privacy.It was all well till suddenly out of no where, the water from the toilet started to regurgitate and flow out to the bathroom floor.That really was a mood spoiler as it was my birthday and the whole room smelled like poop and urine.Complained to the front desk and I thought they would change the room but instead sent a guy to pour chemical into the drain hole and fix air freshener ‍️‍️‍️. I’m a Bon voy platinum member but sadly I had to continue sleeping in that unpleasant smell the whole night in the same room.Complained the next morning again to the front desk and he just smiled and changed the topic. So I just ignored.Besides the smell , the room was good.Basic amenities are there.Coffee maker , toothbrush , soaps and etc.Mini bar is chargeable.In room dining is extremely expensive.F&B -We had buffet for dinner - it was ok.Not bad.Varieties were there.The staffs were okay but I really pity them as they are all working double shifts mostly and in the end of the day all looks exhausted and malfunctioning.I understand that it’s probably due to MCO and lacking of resources.Otherwise the staffs were trying their best to keep up and smile and met all our requests.Bravo to them.Breakfast - bento sets. I have shared some pics please check it out for the menu.Can’t do much as it’s due to the RMCO.But in a way it’s good coz one portion is big and you get full. So it’s avoiding food wastage and over eating too.Tea time - tea and scones ( must try) they have nice tea and scones and some savoury pastries.Prices ranges from rm 70-140 per pax depending on which location you will have your teas and scones.Take the one in colonial cafe which is cheaper and the one in orchid room which is more expensive.What’s disappointing is some food was the frozen and fast food.Ordered chicken wings they gv 8 pieces of it ( but it’s frozen ones) like the Ayamas or other brand. Im not exactly sure but we eat that at home which cost around rm 55.So please be wise in choosing your menus.Overall I think the food prices were expensive thn most hotels ( for me ).Varieties also limited.Depends on preference.There are no shops around that hotel so you have no choice to buy is there or get grab food.If you can walk around 2-3km then you could find some food around.Pool - clean , 4ft depth.           They have timing that allow only 2 pax per hour session.So it’s good at least it’s open. Gym is open too.Entertainment : they have one of the best jazz groups in the country performing daily. It’s called the Solianos. It’s really soothing to listen to these guys performing.Overall I was happy with my stay except for the room toilet issues but it’s ok.Will surely  go back again. Hope someImprovement will be done based on these comments here.Thank you :-) ",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

The check in service was good and efficient.We booked a suite for ourselves and a twin bed for the kids, so everyone had enough space.Breakfast and dinner was at the colonial cafe and all meals were served in bento.My stay was marred by the loss of my earpods which I left in the room and they were missing after we came back. My own fault for not locking them in the safe. The second issue is how slow the breakfast was on the second morning. I understand there were probably short of staff but the service while good, was slow.  Will definitely go back again.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
47,3.0,"We returned to Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur to reward ourselves with a staycation within the city. We had an amazing time there 2 years ago and it was our first choice when we wanted to go for this staycation. However, we were a bit disappointed laa.. 1. Parking - changed to cashless parking. RM14 per day (multiple access but need to be validated at the reception before exit). However, if you exited and your TnG balance is less than RM20, you cannot re-enter .... really inconvenient. And imho, stay in guest should not even have to pay RM14 parking fees.. so low class wei ..2. Room upon entry very nice.. but towels got stains, bath tub not cleaned properly. I have to clean it up before use (takut mah) .. 3. No buffet breakfast but understandable because of the Covid situation Overall, compared to our first experience at The Majestic ... this time round is less majestic lah .. But the bed and pillow still the best ! I will rate it 3.5/5.  Hopefully the next time we return (unsure), we will get to enjoy the real Majestic hospitality again.

It takes about 30 minutes for them to clear the bento (we had to prompt the waiter) and takes another 20 minutes to serve the dessert after clearing. Dessert came together with coffee , and A spoon ( to be used for cake and coffee?) As for their “5 choice selectors” - Presentation of the food is definitely worst than a restaurant. Serving bento set ? Oh man, worst place to pick for birthday celebration. Room was fine except they had wedding on going and the music and speech from the event can be heard clearly and loudly from the room. Sound proof is terrible and should have not put your guest at the room near to the event space if there is an event on going.

I called to enquire....""Our Operators are busy...please hold.""  Hello, Operator....Front Desk please...can I help you.... front desk please.... Hi can you tell me what you want...Front Desk please.... Front desk reached...no answer.  Hang up, called about 5 times, leaving my call hack number, asked for the concierge....""Not available""...How about Contango...sorry no one able to assist you there.""  Took my number also.By 4pm, trying to make a lunch reservation for Wednesday seemed 1) annoying...2) time consuming...3) and still not sure about the menu options? 4) space options?

50,1.0,"I have honestly stayed in majestic couple of times and thought it will be great to come back again for a birthday celebration. Little did I know, because of MCO, majestic have turned their buffet breakfast into alacarte (with only asian or American choice) in a BENTO BOX! Seriously! Who puts american breakfast in a BENTO Box? I was not notified at all of the change of breakfast ( from buffet to a bento box) prior to coming. I was only informed upon checkin, and I told them it’s not a fair choice for me to be paying buffet breakfast price for an alacarte american breakfast in a BENTO BOX! This was not I signed up for. Had I known about it, I would’ve gone for the room without the breakfast. The staff told me to take it up to agoda instead! Because I have booked the room via a third party website so they can’t do anything about it! Not to mention, I’m a gold  class marriot bonvoy member, the front desk refused my upgrade and told me ‘ only platinum is guaranteed’. I told them ‘ yes upon availability, but I checked on the websites/agoda that there r plenty of availability as it is still up for sale on the website’. The staff said those rooms are for paying customer. I mean seriously? What’s the point of having majestic join w marriot bonvoy if they are going to be playing this tricks! They mentioned the reason why they have decided to go ahead with the alacarte instead of buffet because of social distancing and other hotels are also doing it. That’s the biggest lie I ever heard ! I just came from another hotel staycation (ke Méridien) and we just had breakfast buffet there. And if a hotel truly want to have buffet breakfast, there is always a way to manage the social distancing practice instead of going alacarte in a bento. I’m very disappointed in my stay with majestic. I could’ve just extended my nights in le Méridien instead of staying my last night with majestic. Least I would be able to get a buffet breakfast out of it. Additionally, i tried using the bathtub, as I switch on the tap, the water was leaking out of the floor, the toilet was flooding. This is not the experience I sign up for ! I’m truly disappointed and I will not return again. For the money I pay, id rather put it in other hotel.  I will leave the same review on trip advisor so everyone are well aware before they pay.  Also, I do not like the fact that as soon as I enter the room. It smells like smoke/cigarettes. My husband and I do not smoke, hence we are quite sensitive to the smell. They did not ventilate the room and did a proper check before we came in. Had to request for another change of room. There were several areas that were moldy. No upkeep of maintenance. It’s definitely not value for money. Wouldn’t recommend at all.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
51,1.0,"Hello from your disappointed guest, kindly read my points below:1) The hotel provided an upgrade to us for our stay(Colonial Suite) which I think not bad - for a first impression :)2) Checked-in, the room is big and nice. However, me and my wife found that the quilt has some sort of moldy smell. I thought 5 star hotel would have quality checks on every room thoroughly.3) Be careful, the Hotel has ‘hidden charges’ - the parking rate. To be honest, we didnt know that the parking rate is rm14 for 24hour and we thought that rm14 is one-off charge by the Hotel. I believe the hotel didnt mention about its parking (hidden charge) on its website, or perhaps it is somewhere which im unable to find (my dear hotel team, please give the link related to parking rate if you have, I can use the link for reference and future sharing purposes). So guys, be careful when you plan to stay here, just make sure that you guys have extra rm14 parking per day (depending how long you guys gonna stay). I feel like I indirectly being scammed ;) Maybe this is another way of hotel to get additional ‘other income’ (finance jargon) to cover the operating cost, or maybe the hotel has its own wealthy standard (baron class etc). Plus, one of your staff, when they explain to me about the parking, are comparing parking between majestic and another hotel, I wonder...the ethics..4) Breakfast is average only, nothing special, plus you need to book your breakfast time at least a night before5) Worth or not? I would say the rm850 rate i spent for two nights....I will leave it to you all to decide itYour beloved guest :)",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

Saw a housekeeping wore slippers walking past us, the lady server poured a breakfast coffee & spilled it on our table & floor without saying anything (let alone sorry) and not even wipe it off.  The ceiling was peeling. I know it’s an old hotel but it has lost its magic. I yet born during its era (colonial times) but expected the same pleasure but I left with frustration. Should have stick to original plan to stay in a newer hotel or Tower Wing (been there once & was happy) But I’m pleased with my last minute request to have afternoon tea and managed to get one (via Whatsapp) at Drawing Room.

The breakfast is served ala carte style with very limited choice. Had the nasi lemak bento which is quite disappointing. But a huge complement needs to be given to the remaining staff who are an absolute champion. The same staff took care of the reception counter, serves breakfast and tend to everything in between.

Dinner set there was great with good ambience and attentive waitress and waiters. But choice of a la carte and price could be better.  Bed and pillow was so very superb I think that was one of the highlights for me. No more buffet breakfast so , felt like lack of choice. As it was served in a bento set. Swim pool at gym level was not opened ( I wished it was as it will be a good thing to be able to dip in after a gym workout ) Receptionists at check in looked very junior and less attentive. Syed was one who served us well and Syarizal was very friendly and professional to chat with.

55,5.0,"Booked the cheapest room at 350rm/night but was given the opportunity to upgrade to one of their club rooms at check-in for an extra 150rm/night. Upgrade was well worth it. Huge room in the original building with separate living room and a huge bathroom. We’ve previously stayed in the newer tower wing but quite simply doesn’t compare. The complimentary (for club rooms) ‘afternoon tea’ is limited compared to the Grand Hyatt in KLCC, serving a few pastries and that sort of thing. Big perk of the club rooms is the 24 hour check in/out period - perfect if you arrive late at night and want to leave late at night. Also the complimentary unlimited laundry is a big perk (completely took advantage of this and ended up getting a full two suitcases dry cleaned.) The pool is pretty basic if I’m being honest, and not that much fun to be in compared to some of the other KL hotels. Breakfast was very good (probs better than the Hyatt but without the views). Staff were excellent. Hotel is a bit out of the way if you want to get into KLCC but when you consider the price of Grab, (SEA’s equivalent to Uber) it’s not really an issue.

They don’t have car parking ticket like other hotel does. You need to use your touchngo or your ATM card. check-in process was okay but they didn’t explained to me about the parking fees and I forgotten to ask about it until I went out to met my friend. The parking is chargeable at RM14 at your first exit with multiple exits. But you need to validate your card parking payment at the reception before your first exit. I never encounter this kind of experience before even Four Seasons hotel give free parking for their in house guest or guest that dine in in their restaurant.My room is at level 1 and the room number is 111. The button lift maybe need to be sanitise frequently because I can see a lots of fingerprints. I think is not hygiene at all and since it’s covid pandemic need to be extra careful. The room was okay. Next is about the breakfast. I asked for in room breakfast to send to the room at 830am. After I finish my breakfast I went back to sleep. I’m not sure what time is that and my room phone rang and I didn’t pick up because i was really tired. And around 11am, has this one young man from F&B bell my room and disturb my sleep just to take back the breakfast tray. I mean i will check out soon why you need to take the tray?

I have invited my friends for my birthday celebrations and all of them found that it’s not worth as a suite and price. One of them was staying in the hotel as well, she said it’s totally different from what they got when they’re staying in the suite in Majestic last time.Secondly, there’s no one to greet me for my birthday and there’s nothing happen during my whole stay. It’s totally unacceptable as for SPG standard. It means SPG members’ profile is totally not worth for your crew to read it before or when your guest approach. Third, the parking fee is hilarious. I’m totally understood that not in-house guest will need to pay for the car parking entrance fee but it’s not for the in-house guest. Some more we’re staying for three days in a suite, it has charged for RM45 for three days stays.  Is your hotel is so crazy about money? Even we have stayed in your property and we still have to pay for the parking? Funny. This is the first hotel ever. Forth, as per mentioned, I was staying in an “upgraded” suite room in the majestic wing, the breakfast totally sucked! Two days breakfast with only pastries, don’t even have any sausages or ham or eggs or something else even we have asked for it. Also, we will have to call to the counter, begging for jam & butter for toasts and milk for tea! How much does these cost to you? Fifth, the decoration in the living room, there’s missing a warm and comfortable feel to the hotel guest. The couch just empties without any cushions on it which makes the couches and the living room not comfortable to sit with. We can’t sit there for more than 15 mins as there was nothing to support our backs when we’re on the couch. The couches were quite deep for the depth. We have to bring our pillows from the bedroom to use it as a back supports which is not hygienic and ergonomics. I have no ideals or any plans to stay with this property again as it has disappointed me and my partners, even my friends. For me, I think the excellent reviews of your property is not worth for my stays. I definitely share my experiences with TripAdvisor or Google review or anyone who/ which to know more about your property. Good luck!  ",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

61,1.0,"Majestic Hotel review. I stayed here for 3 days 2 nights with my Fiancé last week. Initially,i would want to rate this below average,but right before we left the hotel,i would say the rating went from below average to BAD. 1. On the first day, upon arrival my fiancé carried all of our luggages on his own. No hotel staff or bell boy offered to help him with it.I felt bad and ran over to give him a hand.2. Upon arrival, i was told that there will be no breakfast spread as the hotel restaurants are closed. Imagine paying extra for breakfast only to be given this news. ( It should have been stated on their websites),or practise social distancing during breakfast at the restaurant. The restaurants were open for dining during dinner though. -so dinner is allowed but not breakfast. The pool and all other amenities and facilities were closed as well,which was understandable since we’re still under RMCO. 3. Breakfast was served in the room, however it only came with a few types of bread,butter,jam,coffee and juice. Additional request,such as an egg would incur additional charges which was just unacceptable. They would not give anything extra to compensate for the poor breakfast spread. 4. Second day,in room breakfast dining came in with only one of each type bread/pastry.  I paid for 2 people, however the hotel conveniently reduced the serving for the second day. I guess they were assuming that my fiancé and i will share the tiny danishes. 5. Second day, i came back to the room to use the bathtub,only to find the bathtub drain lever is not working. Informed the icenter, and was advised that someone would actually come and look it,but no one came. Disappointing service. Over all the entire experience was a complete waste of time and money. It was the most unpleasant hotel stay. I would recommend to check out other hotels around the area.

On both occasions we stayed in the old part of the hotel i.e. not the tower. Our rooms were very clean (thank you Awal for your help and excellent service) and well supplied and the upgrade gave us a free minibar with soft drinks and access to a lounge with happy hour plus.

The National Museum is located close by and the other sites are within a walkable distance (20 mins walk).Only issue I could say is that, other guests rooms can see into yours.

Additionally the TV is not a modern, smart TV, so no YouTube and other internet channels.Breakfast buffet is a highlight, with multiple themed stations offering Malay, Indian, Chinese and all sorts of Western food, all excellent in taste. Just the coffee is not up to the standard, no matter whether it is the regular brewed coffee or the espresso... I suggest to ask the friendly barista for milk-based coffees to cover the taste of the beans...The gym is big and well equipped with a wide range of modern machines. I suggest to add  more choice of light dumbbells, as those available start at 2.5 kg and the next level up is 5 kg... there should be 1, 2 and 3 kg dumbbells as well.The staff are extremely friendly and respectful, really trying hard to assist and please, surely a highlight of this hotel!",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

71,4.0,"The architecture and decor of the hotel are really quite a sight to behold. The experience feels otherworldly; taking a vacation here feels like a real vacation. Everything looks clean, well-maintained, and tastefully designed. The room feels very, very grand. It’s probably one of the better looking hotel rooms I’ve been in. It admits a lot of light, but the curtains contain the darkness very well when I wanted them to. The bathroom feels very special; it is spacious, and very well laid-out.(None of the rooms in the hotel are smoking; however, my room smelled of cigarette smoke when I arrived. The attendant who tried to address the issue with air freshener told me that another guest might be smoking in their room, and the smell was wafting in through the air conditioner.)Syed of the front desk and Rauf of the Smokehouse were very attentive and truly knew how to listen to guests. I made very specific requests, and they captured them beautifully. They made me feel that they understood me. The lady answering phones for in-room dining also managed my expectations quite well; I wish I could recall her name.Trouble was with some staff, though, who seemed to have challenges thinking things through. I was double charged for my stay, made to wait for an hour for a drink, and was embarrassed by the wait staff at the restaurant. Really, really small stuff each on their own, but they are worrisome when they add up. (Top tip: imagine you’re dealing with interns who are well-meaning but will make mistakes; this should set you up for the pretty basic mistakes the staff will possibly make.)Food is good and very affordable. I really liked the crab carbonara and the aglio lio in-room. The tomato soup was also lovely. (I wish they had more options in their menu, but what they had was generally very good.) At the Colonial House, order the oxtail soup and the chicken rice. They’re really good.The breakfast buffet In Level 1 can feel quite loud and hurried. I went there everyday of my stay, but I couldn’t muster more than a cup of coffee. Perhaps the hotel attracts some type of folks, but, when I was there, the guests were very distracting and were bent on overeating. I just ordered my own food upstairs.The hotel has few but well-maintained indoor plants. The flowers also look amazing. One morning, I was pleased to pick up the unmistakable smell of stargazer lillies in the lobby.The hotel truly is a marvel, and I would love to return on my next trip.

This enable us to fix the sightseeing in a short space of time. Oh when we arrived at great deal of trouble was spent of when we were leaving.  It was very important to make immediate contact with the firm collecting us three days later to take us to the airport at 6am. All very efficient. They even have minibus tranfers to take you to different parts of the city.  My wife really likes orchids and this is exentuated by a vist to the orchid atrium a really legacy to the past.

The pictures and reviews set my expectations high for my three day post flight pre resort stay but as I begin my final full day I can’t wait to leave.  Don’t get me wrong this place has charm but it’s lacking everything else that one would expect of a 5 star hotel!  I’m on the 10th floor, I was on the 12th but my room had a leak so I move.  Nothing wrong with that except for the smell.  Goodness this place needs a deep clean and could probably do away with in room carpets and replace or deep clean soft furnishings - marks and stains are unacceptable.  Throughly room smell which was unpleasant to the point where I had to get a plug in room freshener!!!  Did I mention what this place costs per night in a junior suite!?  Anyway enough about the room let’s move onto service or the lack thereof.  Bar/cafe, Reading room (elite tire only! In my life and extensive travel experience the Ritz Carlton this is not!), tiny room that you can’t get into and even if you did you wouldn’t want to.  Back to the bar/cafe.  I was lucky enough to get a drink, note I said “a drink” because 40 minutes after finishing my small glass of wine any additional service was nowhere to be found.  Not that there were no staff in the bar, there were loads, just that they were busy being busy with each other rather than serving the room.  What a joke!  Again gently reminding myself that I choose this and should have known better than to trust the pretty pictures!  Food, food glorious food!  Well...no.  Average and unnecessarily expensive for the location.  Again, a few historical artefacts and an afternoon tea menu does not make for a credible 5 star hotel experience!Facilities.  There is a gym which I used which wasn’t bad.  Adequate equipment and well stocked with towels and refreshments.  There is a tiny spa pool - practically next to the main road - and the roof pool which is again tiny and just above the main road with no attempt to beautify - that’s about it.  Smoking room I guess useful if that’s what you need but... I’m afraid this hotel needs to do a lot more than simply have outdated colonial charm in this competitive market.  Such a shame but I wouldn’t recommend for more than a quick night if you’re happy to squint past the missives.  ",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
74,5.0,"The Majestic is one of those large hotels that still seems to maintain personality. Everything about it was great, the service, the rooms and the food. Its position makes it a bit difficult to navigate your way around all of the roads that entwine themselves around it, if you are travelling on foot. It is, however, close to the MRT station which is almost certainly the best way of getting into the centre of KL, because the traffic is awful!",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
75,5.0,Stayed for one night. Check in was quick and smooth. Upon settling down in the room I realized that there were some toiletries lacking but housekeeping was quick to send them over. The room was clean. Lightings and air-conditioning was perfect. TV had a good variety of channels. Bed was great. Overall service was too notch and hotel staff were very helpful. The breakfast spread was good however the quality of food especially the Asian cousine was a little disappointing. Also there is a parking fee of RM 15/day that is also applicable to in-house guest which is quite surprising as most hotels waive this fee for guests. Hope they can review this. ,The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

Our suite was perfect and the club lounge area was  a lovely air-conditioned retreat for a quick coffee or cold drink when returning from our expeditions. The breakfast restaurant was large and busy but we always found plenty of food and good service. There are two pool areas a smaller one directly outside the spa area closest to the old part and a large roof top pool in the newer part, both were wonderful.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

We had a corner room and the view was amazing!Be aware that it can be difficult to get a cab or Grab if you plan on catching the 5:00, 5:20 or 5:40 KLIA Express. It was stressful when we were waiting for cab at 5:00 am and were unable to just walk due to the complex road system. We had walked there the long way the day before, but it was at least a half hour and very confusing!Since traffic is so quiet at that time it perhaps would have been better to just order the cab the night before!  We had wanted the ""safety"" if the fast train.Budget tip: There is a local train station directly across the street (a huge ornate building), it's only a few stops to the huge Mid Valley mall. Incidentally it would also take you to KL Sentral in less than five minutes, just not at 5:00 am!!",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
79,5.0,"The Majestic blends modern day luxury with historic features. The lobby certainly has the wow factor!I stayed for 3 nights in the tower, in a huge, modern room with a view of the pool. The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom and had a shower and freestanding bath. I wasn't sure about the open plan design between the bedroom and bathroom, but there was a curtain!Breakfast was a huge buffet with lots of choice, although the service could be a little slow at times. I also tried the evening buffet, and it had everything you could possibly want!The hotel is conveniently located for public transport, near the main Sentral station. It is however on a busy main road which, as well as being noisy, isn't very pedestrian-friendly. The hotel operates a free half-hourly shuttle bus to Sentral (plus others to other locations in KL), which is handy. Alternatively there is a metro stop on the same side of the road as the hotel, by the national museum. It's a 5-10 min walk and only has one dodgy road crossing to contend with! It's a shame it's not easier to explore KL on foot, but from the hotel you can get to the botanical gardens and Merdeka Square.I'm grateful to Felix the concierge, who arranged a ticket for a visit to the Petronas Towers. It was a thrilling experience which I would have missed out on without his help. Thanks Felix!",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

81,5.0,"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel for a week from 17 to 24 January 2020. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, the original structure was built in 1932 and a large extension is beside the original building and completely in keeping. We were in Room 1110, a very large and comfortable room with a lovely view of a historic colonial building across the road, and out over the surrounding area.The building opposite houses the Asian International Arbitration Centre, and dates back to the 1930s. We enjoyed looking at the view, seeing the sun rise in the mornings and the lights at night.The location of the hotel is fantastic, it is set in a historic colonial area, walking distance to the National Museum, and to the National Mosque. Little India and China Town are a short distance away. The hotel has a fleet of small mini buses which take guests to Nu Sentral, Mid Valley Mall, and to Starwood Mall in the Bukit Bintang. These little buses run regularly every half hour, or hourly depending on the destination. The location was quiet and clean, with lots of greenery.The buffet breakfast at the hotel was amazing, whatever guests may want, it was available.We also enjoyed the Colonial Cafe in the evenings, in the original part of the hotel, with lots of seating areas, and soft live music playing. We had a meal there on one of the nights, and it was freshly cooked and delicious.I think the best part of our stay, was the wonderful hotel staff, everyone was just fantastic, so friendly and helpful, and they made us feel special. From the concierges, to the reception staff, to the wait staff, to the chefs, to the bus drivers, everyone was exceptional. The staff were always smiling and genuinely love working at the Majestic.We can throughly recommend the Majestic as a wonderful place to stay, it is I think the best hotel we have stayed at.Thank you to the Majestic Hotel and its staff, you are all special.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

Asked if they had cashier before an attempt to get change.We prepaid our room and was told that booking through an agent disqualify for Marriott Bonvoy which seems kind of strange but as we only stayed 1 night, really couldn’t bother to make a fuss.We had a meal at their restaurant, lovely place with live music.

The train was 4 stops to KLCC and cost 210 rm.

89,1.0,"First the good - clean, historic hotel with some lovely areas and some excellent staff.  so why won't I stay here again?What appears to be a complete lack of management oversight and training as well as a complete disregard for customers comfort - some examples1)  If you have status with Marriott (Bonvoy) you have to argue for the benefits the program describes (I had the exact same experience a year ago - no improvement and REALLY hard to get a manager)  Definitely not a good way to start a stay.2)  People who answer the phone don't have an adequate understanding of English.  e.g.  I need someone to help with the electric outlet......response ""you mean you have a problem with the wash basin?""....no, repeat original request..... ""you mean there is water on the floor""..............................3) Staff stand around talking to each other and completely ignore guests in the executive lounge.  There is no apparent oversight.4)  Tried to swim in spa pool which I was told on checkin was fine.  Staff said I could not use it (b/c not in majestic wing) and denied even when I told them I was expressly told I had access.  On asking at front desk for a manager (a regular staff was sent), again was told that yes access was allowed and an apology was offered.  NO OFFER TO EDUCATE STAFF OR follow up (when I asked twice that it be passed to higher level for training -apathy)  When made to feel so unwelcome and refused use of facility I was entitled to this is NOT a place I want to return.There were many other issues - absolutely no f/u - not even a call or note from management to say sorry and verify that training would be implemented.I totally agree with the review by peterabbeyrichards who apparently had similar experiences.  It really is a shame b/c many staff are very caring and attentive while others are in dire need of customer service training.  Apparently management doesn't care about their customers (at least foreign ones) since issues I brought up last year were not followed up and when suggested again it was a ""new discovery"" (like putting the timetable for the shuttle on the website instead of every 30 minutes indicate location of stops and timing eg ""from station outside kliaexpress arrivals at :55 and :25 past the hour""What a shame :(",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

91,2.0,"We have been regular guests in the Majestic Hotel over the past years. We are also Ambassador Elite members of the Marriott Bonvoy program. This time we stayed for appr. ten days, but then decided not to extend our stay beyond that and not to come back here for a long time for the below stated reasons.The hotel is a beautiful merger between a time long gone by (old wing) and the modern days (new wing), staying true to its colonial heritage. Every single person at the concierge service (Mr. Mueller, as well as the gentleman with the transparent tortois-shell style glasses (Shazim???) and their entire team to be mentioned in particular), as well as in the breakfast area (in particular Mr. Imran and Mr. Ong) are fabulous. HOWEVER, there are some serious deficiencies in the service provided by the iCenter (front desk representation over the room phone), as well as by the housekeeping and the management. Examples: 1. Phone calls from the room to the iCenter are usually attended  by people who have a poor command of the English language and talk in a whisper. You ask for ear buds/ cotton buds and you will be told that these are chargeable (5 RM). Then, they will have ear PLUGS delivered to your room. 2. Essential accessories, such as drinking water, shampoo, conditioner, towels or (see above) ear buds, are not being replenished. This should be easily avoided by going through a checklist, but who am I to give advice? 3. Sometimes you come back from a day out and discover that they just do not make up your room at all (although the DND sign was not out). Not to even mention turndown service, which only sporadically happens (when they are in the mood).The above are just examples of the daily treatment you can expect as a guest. The most disappointing aspect of it all is the fact that any concerns we voiced regarding the above issues were listened, but not responded to at all. It is quite frustrating to take out the time from your stay in order to speak to people and address various problems and find out that both the concerned staff, as well as the management say all the right things in a conversation, but never walk the talk. In fact, you will not even get the notorious ""fruit basked"" as a gesture of apology. What will happen is this: nothing, nothing, nothing. I do not usually post bad comments on the internet, as I am aware that this is only the last resort. In the case of the Majestic Hotel, they are literally asking for it.One last thing: As it is good practice, hotels usually respond to negative comments as follows: ""Thank you for your valuable feedback. We are sorry that the stay was not according to your expectations, etc. etc."" So, I would like to make this clear: any such response to my above review cannot be considered truthful, because I gave the hotel NUMEROUS chances to adequately address my concerns. Any belated apologies or (potentially false) allegations at this point are WAY TOO LATE and can only serve the purpose of showing a dignified face to the internet community. For me personally they are irrelevant at this point.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5
92,3.0,"When we first stepped into our room I was most impressed. We had the junior suite and it was beautiful and spacious. The staff were friendly and helpful and I felt that it would be a very nice place to spend the weekend. Pretty soon however it became apparent that attention to detail was lacking which was a shame as otherwise it is a nice hotel. They were little things that annoyed us but should not occur in such a nice hotel... such as having only 1 bar of soap in the large bathroom with 2 sinks separated by a bathtub, or having only 1 shower cap which was not replaced the next day after use...While the staff were friendly, initiative seemed to be lacking. We came down to take the hotel shuttle 2 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time and was told by staff that it had left and we should have arrived 5 minutes prior. This is totally understandable... except that the bus hadn’t left and we just managed to catch it when we went outside to get a taxi instead!The breakfast was mediocre. One station was empty and no one attended to it despite having a queue. A manager finally noticed the queue and asked one of the staff in the next station to attend to us. He did but obviously did not like being told to do so.I am really giving this feedback as otherwise we like the location and the rooms were nice.

96,4.0,"On arrival at he hotel, it was very impressive to be met by a lovely doorman in a fantastic uniform, who opened the taxi doors and greeted us with a smile. Check-in was fairly straightforward and quick. The room was large and spacious with plenty of room for our luggage, and plenty of seating. Generally, the room was clean although we noticed, when sitting on the sofa, a brown stain on the bedsheet - at least on the edge, so we were not lying on it (see photos). Another downside was the clear glass panel separating the toilet from the shower. It reduced the size of the toilet headroom which made it somewhat awkward when sitting on the toilet. Both of us had difficulties due to this limited headroom - and being clear glass, it is not easy to judge the space.The breakfast choice for western guests is quite restrictive - the food is very much aligned with Asian tastes - probably mainly Malaysian. As a result there was not much to suit our palates, and it was difficult finding enough to eat. We like Earl Grey tea with our breakfast - our first morning we requested a waitress, Ms. Sum Hui, for a teapot of Earl Grey tea. Nothing happened for 15 minutes, so we asked her again. Shortly after, a waiter arrived with just one cup of tea. We were rather taken aback, and explained what we wanted, and he supplied it for us very quickly. Thereafter this waiter (his name is Kamrul) took great care of us, was friendly, willing and helpful. He was a credit to the hotel, and gets our great gratitude for his service to us. However, we do wonder how often the chefs launder their outfits - several had dirty clothes, grey and covered in stains. Looked like it was some time since they were washed.All in all, with the exception of the one waitress, we found the staff affable and helpful. We enjoyed our stay, despite the disappointing breakfast selection for our tastes.",The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur,4.5

I love it’s history and the building entrance. My room was stunning to walk into especially the bedroom. Open space was big enough to have friends over or even gave a meeting. Cons: unfortunately more cons - never met such unfriendly/unhappy looking receptionist, restaurant waiters. I travel a lot for work so as much as I appreciate the grandness of a guest room, I look for practicality- bathroom was nice but no place to put your toiletries. When you have lots of cosmetics, space to put them is what you need. I’m not bothered about the quality of a tissue box but as you can see from my photo, needs to renew? No USB cables which I find very unhelpful esp. for my work travels. Breakfast - never seen such unappetising looking omelette served in a prestigious hotels. Sat at a table next to piles of dirty dishes, the knife they had at a restaurant was so useless because of the odd shape. No single switch beside the bed to turn off all the lights - you have to switch off individual switches.

But they deserve to be mentioned, first location you are practically 10min (minus traffic) from everything and i mean everything KLCC, Mid Valley, DU, PJ etc the parking is free. When you arrive at the hotel its a little bit non descriptive almost an Aladdin cavern  but when you enter then it become a wondrous place. Aslo note you have a 7/11 and other stores conveniently located around the property only walking distance away. Now for the room, ever have a family and looking for big and always in the 1K range or have to get two room well look no further. We booked a 2 bedroom with 2.5 Bathroom with full kitchen and a washing machine/dryer for less than half what you normally get. I kid you not with kids and heat we washed and clean in the washing machine / dryer not fighting over showering or going to the toilet. The staff kept the room clean every time we came back from sightseeing. The pool is half covered so no matter if its raining the kids and everyone can still swim with bar as well.

In one of our stay, We had issues such as water ponding in the bathroom that resulted water flowing into other areas of the room- the hotel said that they were unable to change the room. They did send an apology note with apples and cookies. They didn’t solve the problem. That time we stayed there for 3 nights. At check out there is always a long queue. If you are driving and need to get your ticket endorsed at the time of check in or check out, you might need to wait. As there are only 2/3 staff behind the counter.

90,1.0,"Most, if not all, hotel guests appreciate privacy and security when staying in a hotel. That’s basically why there’s a Do-not-disturb sign outside the room. Hotels’ staff would normally respect the sign, and common courtesy expects the staff to not disturb the guests nor enter the room unless in the case of emergency or other exceptional reasons. There were 2 incidents over my 2 nights stay in VE Hotel that were completely unacceptable. The first incident happened when I requested for an electrician to come fix my air conditioning. I waited but after 30 mins, I decided to put the do not disturb light on and went for a shower. While I was in the shower, the electrician arrived & he knocked loudly on my door. I rushed out of the shower to the door to tell him to come back later. I was annoyed that he didn’t respect my privacy but decided to let it go. Same afternoon, after a nap, I left the room and again, put the do not disturb light on. My luggage was opened, my valuables were on the table so naturally, I didn’t want anyone to enter my room. When I returned 4hrs later, my bed was made, without my consent nor my requesting so. I rang housekeeping to demand for an explanation, the manager explained that they have a policy whereby they’ll knock 3 times and if no answer, they’ll enter the room. I was horrified and asked to speak to the duty manager. And from the duty manager, I received the same response and he confirmed that he actually approved for his staff to enter my room. It left me wondering what’s the purpose of the do not disturb sign in the first place. I escalated this matter to the front office manager and from her, I was told that the policy was for entering a room “without” the do not disturb sign on. The staffs were wrong and the unwarranted entry to my room should never have happened. As a frequent solo traveler, I do need to trust the system to respect my privacy and I need to feel safe and secure. This incident has left me with a feeling not unlike a break-in and my privacy was violated and I felt completely unsafe. So, would I recommend this hotel to anyone? My response is, absolutely Not.

96,4.0,The room was excellent for the rate I paid. I got a discount because of the offer given by Agoda. Otherwise the rate was quite high. The location was good as it was quite far away from the city centre. Anyway the Nexus and The Sphere was close by and linked by a skybridge! Thumbs up! The room I got was ok but the TV was not working. Anyway they rectified the problem as soon as I called. The LRT station was about 1.5km by foot and there were not many tourist spots around. A good place to stay if you want to get away from the usual touristy areas. The safe deposit box in the room was also not working. I expect better maintenance for a hotel with reasonably high room rates in KL.,"VE Hotel & Residence, Kuala Lumpur",4.0
97,4.0,"My office is next door so location was perfect. If in Bangsar South, this hotel is perfect. This is in a new development area with plenty of good restaurants, bars and cafes. The precinct feels a bit like Singapore with manicured gardens. The rooms are new which makes it comfortable. The gym is quite large with a good variety of equipment. There is a changeroom with shower facilities near the gym. The pool design is clever with being under cover but all open. I've stayed there twice now and would each time i go back to the office in KL. The train station is a 10-15 minte walk which takes you into KLCC KL City Centre (Twin towers). The bathroom has quite a few sliding doors (ie 1 that slies across a cupboard and the toilet, another that covers the wardrobe or closes the bathoom area). I had an overnight flight so arrived late morning. The hotel accomodated my request for an early checkin. If you don't want to hear the mosque at 5.30am, request a room further away. The food at breakfast has a lot of local food as wellif you're into that, has an egg station which i liked. It would be nice to be able to make your own natural juices rather than the bottled sugar loaded juices but its the convenience which wasnt expensive.","VE Hotel & Residence, Kuala Lumpur",4.0

0,2.0,"My fiancé and I had chosen to stay at your Hotel due to the location and distinctive architecture that features elements of the Malaysia’s unique heritage. Being a third party agency here in China, my fiancé can have a local Malaysian heritage and cultural experiences so that he can share his experience with the relevant parties here. In the early morning of 26 January 2020 estimated 08:10hrs, I was about to leave the Hotel for reunion at parents, unfortunately, there was a high threshold between the bed chamber and bathroom, I crossed, slipped and fell down in the bathroom of room 455 due to slippery floor, caused my head to hit the ground injured the back of my head, with a lot of blood rushed out from the injured area. I remained calm and made a call to the operator to inform about my injury while blood was spurting from the wound. My fiancé and I waited for someone from the Hotel to bring us to the hospital for medical treatment, however we were not able to wait any longer as I was seriously injured and my wound was bleeding, time is of the essence, I was conscious and able to walk down to the lobby to seek for assistance. There was someone from the Hotel came and checked on my condition and arranged a car to send us off to Prince Court Medical Centre without someone from the Hotel to accompanying us to further understand the condition. If this incident has happened to someone at my home, I could have been taken further steps to keep her / him accompanied. Being someone in the hospitality and tourism industry for almost 15 years, I truly believe this is very basic and necessary.If there is a threshold installed, the edges should be sloped or have an non-slip surface and be adequately secured to the floor. This is important, as the person would encounter an unexpected, increasing the chances for a fall. Ideally, the floor surfaces should be consistent. If hotel guests understand the dangers of a wet bathroom floor, then hotel management must also know and thus take precautions to protect your guests by placing a rubber mat on the floor of the shower or bathroom to prevent skidding. Slipping in the shower or tub is no laughing matter, bathroom falls typically mean violent contact with hard surfaces, which may result in head trauma, broken bones or even death. I suffered a serious head injury when I fell, I may still be dealing with the after effects such as headache which I do encounter such symptom sometimes. During our stay at your Hotel after this incident occurred, none of the employees from your Hotel taken effort to check on my condition, not even a simple call or to leave a message in the room. When we approached the front desk to call for the duty manager for a meet up, we had been asked by the staffs repeatly what purpose was that for while there was bandage around my head, which I felt it was a total negligence from the Hotel.The response from the Hotel was slow during the follow up process which was due to limitation of movement and documents searches, which I completely understand, nonetheless, it took almost half a year.I thought there would be a fair conclusion after a real long investigation by the agency, unfortunately, the conclusion is “there is no insurance coverage”.  None of the insurance agencies had contacted me throughout the 'investigation process"" and the case closed just by sending me a message via WhatsApp without an official response via email. We loved the location and ambience of the Hotel and we did considered your Hotel as one of the venues for our wedding ceremony next year, nevertheless, we will not proceed further due to bad experiences.",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Thumbs up to this 1st impression gave by Ms. HAYATI. Room was enormous & spotless clean. The downside are housekeeping didnt clear up the minibar, dialled no.1 from room phone to get housekeeping to clear it for me & a male operator working night shift on 4th Sept asked me to clear it by myself (whattt????????)The water conditions during my stay was not really ok. It’s not hotel’s fault. Whole Kuala Lumpur facing water supply problem due to shutdown of main supply tank.

When we returned, we first experienced the staff in a competent and friendly manner. Unfortunately, we then had two experiences in the bar and in the lounge, which made us doubt our decision.  After another complaint, both events were excused and repaired. From then on, fresh goods were served in the lounge for breakfast and good cappuccino was offered.  But not by the young male employees who just liked to stroll around in their nice dark suits. It was above all Maria, the employee from the lounge, who delighted us at all times of the day with her friendly manner and very good work.  She always had a smile and a great capuccino or wine for us customers. The Royale Chulan owes her in particular that we would like to come back next.

Room service was the worst pizza I’ve ever tasted and it’s not even worth complaining as we were so hungry - it was literally uncooked dough with a tomato on top. When we first arrived, we were exhausted from our delayed flight, rocking up in our taxi at just past midnight. No bellman came to assist us with our luggage and people are walking around the hotel with their music blasting from their phones.

There is no longer a view of the twin towers from the hotel. The gym was tiny but adequate. The club lounge is very nice and not many people choose to use it. It has several different styles of seating and was a nice place to have a glass of wine and watch a movie in the evening. I had read a review that said there was no alcohol served and was disappointed but there was wine and several kinds of cocktails. The hotel is very conveniently located but with the construction going on it is tricky to get around but not a horrible problem. I had also read reviews of a bad breakfast with not much variety.

Dont mind wasting money cos i travel KL to stay this hotel. Even the reception tell me the other hotel name is Royale bkt bintang  which guests book wrongly.. She doesnt know its now called RC bkt bintang so like me everyone is confused. Its not fair as many waste money and end up getting stranded like a guest i saw. Royale chulan do something abt this to save your image.These 2 hotels are worlds apart. RC bkt bintang is a poor hotel.  read reviews. RC KL as usual is my flavorite. Always good as i reviewed before and other guests. Buffet bfast is expensive though. This time disappointed with the drinks. Mainly coffee tea tarik both dont taste good. No orange juice. Apple juice is not apple juice. These 4 drinks is a must for me for bfast. All 4 this time poorly done. For a high price the basics must be done well. Otherwise not bad. Pls include fish in menu.

It must be said however the maintenance guy came within 10 minutes and fixed it within 2 minutes on both occasions.The hotel is in a very central location but the walk to the hotel needs to be done over a walkway from the Pavillion shopping mall to  another building but this only takes five minutes. However it can be confusing at first! Especially as the shopping center is so large it’s easy to lose track of where the walkway entrance is (hint: it’s behind Starbucks on the 3rd floor).There is an excellent breakfast buffet with a large variety of food so even if you’re staying for multiple days there’s always something different to be had.Front desk staff un particular were excellent.I had an issue with payment but they were very patient and courteous throughout until it was resolved. Thanks guys!The swimming pool is good and the sun lounges are abundant. There aren’t usually many people at the pool so you’ll often have it to yourself or with just a few other people.I’m not much of a gym guy but the hotel gym seems pretty good and I actually got a few workouts in. It also wasn’t busy so I had the place to myself.The wifi isn’t the strongest but it’s decent. I wouldn’t update multiple apps but podcast updates and photo syncing to cloud isn’t an issue.Wifi is also available in the lobby, restaurant and by the pool side.Overall my impression was this place was a 5 star hotel and still delivers a 5 star service. It’s just a bit dated now and some areas could do with a renovation.However I was paying 3 star prices for a 4 star room with 5 star service!Overall great value for money, and great service from all staff that management should be appreciative and proud of!",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

I've booked 3 rooms.hotel room spacious, breakfast splendid, but I dont like hotel staff attitude. first, today after breakfast before continue my shopping, I've requested for late check out up to 1pm for all 3 rooms, the receptionist said no problem to extend my stay. out of sudden there is one staff name Aviana came...she said I cannot extend my stay till 1pm for all 3 rooms, only 1 room is allowed for late check out...which I told her that I'm not intended to check out at 1pm, just in case I cannot make it to get ready every thing. she still refuse and kept repeating her words with funny english language. I feel annoyed with her..so I walk off.second...this morning I went to car park lift...I went inside with one of hotel staff...suddenly he said..this lift is only for staff...not for guest..so I need to take another lift...if the lift is for staff only....why the hotel didn't put a sign there ""for staff only"" or put staff's lift somewhere else...dont put the lift side by side with hotel guest lift.5 star hotel, but it seems like they never trained their staff like 5 star ..I've stayed so many 5 stars' hotel..never encounter all these.I'm supposed to stay at this hotel again in December which I've book the rooms and paid for future stay....I'm going to cancel my December booking...I don't mind if I didn't get my refund.",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
37,1.0,"Hotel is very old and it shows. The air conditioning at lowest setting causes a very audible hum throughout the entire room and there are plenty of construction activities nearby making the area a hazard when walking out of the hotel. Not to mention forget about having a good night sleep due to the AC noise.The worst part is, while charging my laptop, the power point exploded and wiped out my charger and laptop. Manager was nice and apologetic but seemed to imply that the issue might be with incorrect voltage on my laptop adapter, which is completely ridiculous horse manure because laptop chargers are universal and I never had a problem travelling in US, Japan, Europe etc. Hotel is basically a HSE and fire hazard, the Fire Department should do an audit on the whole building again to make sure safe to operate!Unfortunately no resolution was given for my busted laptop and some excuse was given about getting IT to take a look it but I need to leave the next day on a flight to China! Finally, the hotel has no formal complaint system for customers and the manager only offered to take down my details for ""future follow up"". I hope the lack of paper trail is not used as excuse to sweep this issue under the carpet and I expect to see an outcome from this as a lesson learnt!",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Liomsi & Jenny in the Lounge give great friendly service always. Azizi at reception looks after you as if you are family. In fact the reason I always stay at The Royale Chulan in KL, is the staff.

Our ‘upgraded’ room had loose hanging light fixtures, stained carpets, towel rack hanging off, leaking sprayer on both tub and shower and was very dated looking wear and tear wise.  Only pros is hot water was good and bed comfy.  AC did not work well. That was all liveable for price but the part we hated was the staff was a mess.  They were friendlish but all super confused at all roles. It was like all the staff at front desk it was their first day.  We asked for a late check out and were insured no problem, stay until 4pm. Then I realized she didn’t even take our room number so in morning I go to give it to them and now app it is not ok to have late check out without paying 150R so we are already frustrated but agree.  Then when we come back from being out that day we go to front desk to ask something about check out and they are shocked we haven’t already left (we paid and confirmed late checkout until 6pm). So basically between 3 diff staff members every time they just said ya ok then never wrote it down/put it in system. So deactivated our cards while we were at mall and had our stuff stuck in the room. Breakfast was ok, nothing special but not awful.  Super close (4min walk) from pavilion mall and about 100-150R back to KUL Airport.  We wouldn’t choose this hotel again based on the staff alone. They need better training big time.

Entrance to hotel , which is down a back road subject to construction is a bit daunting and feels unsafe at night currently but it’s fine .Hotel lobby is stunning , and there are multiple places to eat and drink at reasonable prices . The club area is dark and the air con is likely to drop water on you if you sit at the bar. The rooms are , on the face of it , reasonable but I wouldn’t call it 5* quality. They are a bit dated . Wooden poles, somehow meant to be part of the bed wee lying loose on the floor under the bed. The plumbing in the bathroom was subject to easy blockage.The aircon in the room- noisy noisy and noisy but due to the heat you have no choice but to leave it on and try to sleep with the noise .Altogether - an OK experience but nothing special and certainly not one that would merit a 5-* rating ",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

However they just offered me vouchers for 20% off their f&b which I confirmed with them that all hotel guests get. So Where's the privilege for Expedia gold??? Best part they gave me one of the rooms facing some dingy back of a building.I usually have pretty nice experiences at other hotels that are considered Expedia Gold partners in Taiwan and Japan but this partnership with royale chulan doesn't seem to take this collaboration seriously. In future I would suggest all Expedia gold members ask their privileges first before booking so you can weigh between booking a expedia VIP hotel or just a regular hotel.I have another 3 days in this hotel but I'm really not feeling it.,Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

My travel bag was with me whole way back home and never left my eyes. The only time that the notes could be replaced was in the hotel room. Most likely between 2 & 3 Aug. The one who replaced the notes should have the five $1 cash with him/her. This means she/he should have known I have $100 notes. He/she didn’t replace all the seven notes, but only the middle five.

From Malay to Chinese to Continental to American to whatever you can think of you will find it in buffet.

Check-out was at 6 in the morning and was quick and easy.2. Room was pretty big and had a small patio with a view over the pool.  Bathroom was also well-sized, so no complaints there.  I was able to use a spare keycard to keep the aircon going while I was out, which I was very happy with as it was quite noisy when it was on full tilt.3. Bed was very comfortable, with a nice selection of pillows.

Sadly the business manager Suria has now moved on but the rest of the staff as ever go out of their way to look after me. The duty manager Mr Nor Ridzuan Hassan was on hand to make sure that all repeat customers get looked after and he was doing an amazing job and he is a credit to the hotel and the rest of the management team.The food is as good as ever and I love Malaysian food and the spices that they offer. The buffet offers a good choice and variety. I was lucky this trip as they had a 30% discount promotion on and it was well received. The rooms are cleaned daily and the cleaners will always ask if you need any more water, sugar, coffee etc. I really cannot finds any dissatisfaction with this hotel.As this was a business trip I had a lot of paperwork to catch up on and Rose in the business centre was a diamond as she helped with any support from printing to access to copiers etc. for business this hotel is again awesome as they have such amazing facilities and give the right support needed to make your stay a successful one.The only comment that I do have is that some of the gym equipment is in need of servicing.

Our previous visits were always pleasant and we had no issues.We stayed for 2 nights in a room that could use a make over. There are general signs of wear and tear that need attention given that this is a 5 Star hotel. Paint on doors is chipping and discoloration of the tile joints in the shower. Also I would not expect to have holes in the sheet on the bed.The check inn was smooth and quick and we were given discount vouchers for the hotel restaurants.As it had been my birthday we decided to visit the steak restaurant. What a surprise to see that we were the only 2 guests in the restaurant, including the other 2 adjacent restaurants.My partner and I both ordered a Sirloin Steak and a glass of wine.The wine arrived first and we were both appalled. The wine was undrinkable because the bottle must have been open for some time - undrinkable.The steaks were ordered bleu and medium which turned out to be medium and well done and not seared but appeared baked.. They came with 5! pieces of pasta dipped in Chilli Sauce.We spoke to the Restaurant Manager who apologised and  told us that the wine comes directly from the bar downstairs and that they would speak to the cook who admittedley did not know what ""bleu"" meant.For a 5 star hotel this is not acceptable.

84,3.0,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights to attend a conference held in the hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 1pm thinking that the rooms may not be ready, but there are already ready rooms. The Check in experience was good. It was done in 5 mins. Room size is considered big with a huge bath tub that can open up to the room itself. The TV provided is 32”. In my opinion, it is abit small for the room size. The carpet in the room feels like it has not beem chemically washed or shampooed for awhile. I usually walk about in a hotel room barefooted, but for this room, i had to use the bedroom slippers provided. Besides that, the room generally is not too bad. Breakfast is at the cafe next to the lobby. The spread is acceptable, but does not have a “wow” factor. The hotel is a street next to Pavilion, officially as per google map, you can reach the mall in less than 10 mins. But to cross the road that separate Pavilion and the hotel is going to take you easily 20 mins as the traffic is very heavy.",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5
85,5.0,"In the middle of our stay, we contacted the hotel directly and they gave us an unbeatable price, emails with customer service was quick and polite.We were upgraded on arrival which was very much appreciated.1 bed apartment with huge balcony and bathroom. All the staff very welcoming and those that recognised us from our previous visits were genuinely pleased to see  us , especially the bengali chap in the tuxedo in the restaurant and his two assistants,  I am sure that if they could have brought breakfast to our room the y would have done.We also had dinner in the restaurant it was very  nice.Salahuddin who was our housekeeper on our previous visits came to see us every day  to make sure all was well and Sophia our cleaner came and introduced herself on the first day which is nice.Has there been the odd minor issue?....yes there has, but I would say that all businesses  , hospitality or otherwise are not perfect and neither is the Chulan, but what they do is strive hard for their guests and you cannot ask more than that and it's why we come back  every year, but I have to say that it would be nice to see the GM walking around at breakfast and speaking with guests in 4 visits I have never seen him.In conclusion great hotel,good location, good food and good rooms",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

And all the more if you are equipped with the stroller, you're in one hell of a walk when you're walking to the nearby Pavilion. One way to get to Pavilion if you are equipped with a stroller is to walk on the right side of the road until you get to the Banyan Tree Hotel where they have a lift that get you across to the bridge to Pavilion.Heard the breakfast is very popular among the hotel stayers.

Breakfast was good with nice offering but should have more  varieties at the salad bar. Walking distance to Pavilion Shopping about 5 to 10 mins walk. Too bad this hotel does not have sauna facilities but when booked under Hotel.Com it mentioned this hotel has sauna facilities. The information provided by Hotel.

We spend Chrismas days in Kuala Lumpur, so the hotel was decorated with huge trees, with lights and other winter decorations. Its entrance hall is huge, with Royal air and tastefully decorated. They organised a small show with music and dance for Christmas - which all guests enjoyed a lot. Check-in was quick, the staff extremely helpful. We had a wonderful breakfast every morning, at Warisan Coffee (amazing selection of breads and flat breads from all over the world, some freshly made by handy bakers, in front of our eyes)The joyful boys at the Concierge helped us booking a massage at the hotel Spa and finding our ways in the city. Room was big, clean and nicely organised (we really appreciated the toilet separated from shower and the rest of the bathroom). Quality of sleep very good. Our daughter was also very pleased with her ""smoker"" room, too. We enjoyed a fresh orange juice and a coffee at the Lanai lounge, in the main lobby, in the company of a wonderful piano player and a vocal singer. They started around 9 pm and kept singing after 11.00 pm, when we left. And we loved the cakes and cockies from their lobby display - we couldn't help not to buy a lot of them!We loved the open swimming pool, with a view toward Petronas towers - we spend almost every afternoon here. And the location of the hotel, near the central park and Suria KLCC and near Pavilion mall and many other attractions is one of the best.  Check out was also very easy and they ordered a car for us, to take us to the airport. Overal, we felt like home, people were so friendly and we loved every minute of the experience.

95,2.0,"Let's start with a few positives.  1.  The location (close to the pavilion shopping centre and heaps of restaurants).  2. The food (breakfast & dinner great buffet, amazing selection & room service delicious too).  It pretty much stops there.  As far as the room was concerned it was old and tired and not cleaned well.  There was mould in the shower, I had to get maintenance to unblock the toilet multiple times and they didn't seem to clean when they 'serviced' the room.  And I use the word 'serviced' very lightly.  First day I had towels, hand towels and floor mat.  then the hand towels disappeared and then the floor mat.  They weren't replacing them.  Even when I specifically asked the lady who was in my room at 6:30 at night, she said yes, looked in her cart and realized nothing there so just left.  The following night I had to call them at 7pm and tell them no one had been to my room all day and I had no clean towels (they had been dwindling every day not being replaced).  At 8:30 that night they came.  Then of course there was the fact that there is construction going on around the hotel.  Unfortunately it was on my side so it wasn't unusual to hear jackhammering well into the evening.  This was a business trip and definitely not my choice of hotel.  Pretty disappointing week.",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

98,2.0,"“Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur, a luxurious 5-star accommodation”. Well, I beg to differ.From, worn out carpet, torn bed sheet and what can I say about the window. I guess it must have not been cleaned since they officially opened in 2013. I get the traditional concept of the room, however, all the furniture and the curtains are too outdated for a 5-star hotel.Another point that I would like to highlight is that the hotel has regulations on wearing a singlet to the Warisan Café. Well, I experienced it first hand. I obliged and change my attire since it is the hotel rules. However, while I am having my breakfast, I can see two men wearing a black singlet in the café. Wait. Why can they wear a singlet and have breakfast while I have to change my shirt to follow the hotel rule?Once I finished my breakfast, I ask the maître d′ about the rules. She explained that all guest is notified regarding the rules during check-in. Well, I have not been notified, I can assure you that. I then point her to the two foreign men wearing the black singlet. She calmly explained. “We already try explaining it to them but they don’t listen and we can’t do anything.”So I guess, rules can be bend if the guest insists not to follow them. Why did you come up with the rule if you can’t follow them anyway? Double standard?5-star accommodation? Make it 2 or 3 instead.",Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Also, we were informed during check in that their breakfast lounge is not opened and there’s no room service as well (probably due to the pandemic).

Laundry area  was also spacious and handy to use(after swiming at pool, we can use it for spin our swimming suits and dry up very easily).Breakfast was amazing!  We chose American breakfast(RM15 per person), and we were surprised at them as they were delivered to our room unit(Because of current situation, cafe area is now closed. Staff kindly delivered to each guests unit every morning!).Absolutely It was worth more than their price! In fact, we could not finish up all breads, then we enjoyed them for our lunch or snack.We should not forget about, they offer Water Server on each level. Because each of our family member drink 2L of water per day, it was so helpful. We do not have to buy water bottles outside, and we can contribute reducing plastic bottels, too. Awesome idea!This hotel's location is fantastically great! We found it that this hotel is located in hidden gourmet town.Just In front of this hotel, there is a very attractice Japanese restaurant.

Upon entering Malaysia, he was asked to serve 14 day Stay Home Notice by the Government.   As we did not want the grandparents to be exposed to him, we decided to get him to stay at a KL hotel.  The hotel we chose was Parkroyal Serviced Suite KL.The suite room is spacious and neat.  There is a small kitchen and living hall, so plenty of room for him to do some simple cooking and stretching his muscles.    All were good, until he developed some fever on the 5th day of his stay there.All of us were getting panic as we could not attend to him since we were actually living in Singapore.   He tried to call the government body to seek help, but was getting very little support.    At the end, he turned to the hotel asking for help.   This was when we realized the hotel is really different from other 5 stars hotel/service suites.A hotel staff by the name of Jessica Lee took the trouble to find out the situation of my son.   She offered him a lot of helpful information to him as to who and how to call.  She also helped to arrange transportation for him to go for Covid swab test the next day.    What's more warming to our heart is that she did not just stop there, but continued to follow up with him to make sure his test was OK.    At the same time,  she whatsapp'ed me to update me on his status.   She even offered him a piece of cake as she said that he looked ""stressed"" with the whole Covid testing !We were so grateful to have Jessica stepping in as his ""guardian"" when we were not able to look after him during this difficult time.   Her care and love for her hotel guest is beyond what a hotel staff would normally do.       What she had done for my son makes the KL Parkroyal Serviced Suite a very special home to my son.

13,5.0,"The Parkroyal serviced suites wasn't a hotel for us. It was home for about 4 months when I was working there.When I checked in at the Parkroyal, it was like entering a hotel. When I left, it was like leaving friends and a temporary home that we will always have fond memories of.I chose this place because of its strategic location. It was hardly 2kms from my office, so my office commute was an absolute breeze. But it also has a lot of other things working for it. It's in the heart of the touristy Bukit Bintang with a lot of things at walking distance. Changkat, a party street packed with pubs is a few minutes walk while some of their best malls, KLCC and Pavilion are barely a 10-15 min walk away. The area is packed with restaurants and you can get different kinds of cuisines around, absolute abundance of food around. The food options are in abundance and there's something to suit everyone's cuisine preferences.Importantly, the monorail and mrt stations are a short walk away, so getting around the city is quite easy. There are free buses plying from the bus stand on the main road outside the hotel to get around in the city as well.The rooms are well laid out and very comfortable with a small but well equipped kitchenette. We had a fair bit of luggage given that we were there for a few months but there was ample storage space. They are also doing renovations to address some small issues on leakages and refurbishments, so the place will only get better. It has a gorgeous rooftop pool on the 30th floor with views overlooking the beautiful skyline of Kuala Lumpur. The rooftop pool is open till 10pm, which helped as I would often take a late evening swim post office. There is a larger pool on the first floor as well though I never ended up using it. The gym is functional and has all the basic equipment for a regular workout. The best part about this place is the people. The staff at Parkroyal was very helpful and incredibly warm and went out of the way to make sure that we were well looked after. Though short in numbers on the odd occasion or even on days that they had high occupancy, they would try their best to attend to our needs. One time when we were hosting people for dinner at our room, they ensured we had extra crockery and cutlery, chairs as well as additional housekeeping to clear up post dinner. The supervisor would personally ensure that these additional requirements were taken care of. It would take some time but it would get done. The house keeping staff across the rooms we stayed in were efficient and thorough. The front desk staff was always helpful with suggestions and recommendations. In fact, the entire staff collectively ensured that the hotel felt like home for the few months that we were there.A special shout to the people we regularly interacted with and who were very helpful - Siva, Ernavati, Siti, Ian and Suhaimi from the front desk, Inayat and Gurupal from housekeeping, Patel from maintenance.My wife also spent a fair bit of time interacting with the staff including exchanging recipes with the chef.Our stay in Malaysia was a brilliant experience, both personally and professionally and our stay at Parkroyal was a big contributor in making this a rather memorable stay.",PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Staff were generally friendly. One or two at the front were not that helpful when we asked for late check out and so waited for the shift to change and asked again. We were happy to pay a small amount to check out at 7pm.Breakfast is average. They probably need more staff to assist in clearing tables and sweeping the food debris off the floors before the next group sit down.It is about 15-20 min walking distance to the Pavilion, Bukit Bintang, Sungei Wang and the main shopping street.

The pool and gym facilities are satisfactory with dumbbells up to 25kg. You’d be doing well to find something else in the area that represents value for money like this property. If you prefer a newer more modern complex, take a look at the nearby TriBecca. A couple of restaurant tips for those interested.

We travel 3 or 4 times a year and at least once to KL and this is the 1st time we were asked to sleep on the sofa when we clearly made a booking for 4 people so be aware. Then she said we can send you 2 single beds for RM60 so I said ok and at check out they charged RM60 for every night which they never told us. Rooms are very old, the air conditioning making noise all night and they are positioned so they can blow on you directly so every morning we woke with either blocked nose or sore throat which was not pleasant when on holiday. Breakfast is the worst we have had in Kuala Lumpur, very very basic, cakes are so hard, fruits are tasteless and very crowded in a very small area that if you leave your seat you find it difficult to sit back. This hotel at best is 3 stars but I would say 2 stars really. The only reason it has some good reviews is because they have a lot of people from the middle east and maybe to their standard it's ok but to western standard nothing more than basic 3 stars. We stayed on the 8th floor and the noise from the road kept us awake all night so again be aware. We even missed the breakfast towards the end and just got coffee and cake from outside. Will not recommend at all.",PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

BUT although very busy at the front desk and with a big boss hanging around directing staff whilst they swapped Xmas for Chinese New Year , Ian ( not his real name I guess) was so very helpful apologetic . We had our cab waiting as we had plans to meet family for supper. All we needed was to freshen up a bit which Ian helped us with. Stored our bags in the office and got us access to freshen ourselves a bit so we could run back out as the room was being dealt with.Our son couldn't wait and headed across the road to get some local food ( roti canai) instead of eating it there he got it to take away........Ian came to the rescue again and took him and his sister through to the dining area and got them a plate and bowl so they could eat........thank you very much Ian you made our always happy stay even better with your heart felt customer service.....Great stay as always so thank you all very much, we had a suite wth two rooms for our family which is very spacious. Comes with kitchen and dining area and good size lounge area with another room which seems to be set up for an office ( great for out daughter who had to do some studying whilst we were away....) and one of the best things we like sad as it may seem is that it has a washing machine and dryer.....which we love as it means we don't return home with dirty washing....The place is very central with a couple of minute walk to serval malls ( pavilion , sungai wang, lot 10) as well and local bars and hawker area ....BIG TIP.......Cabs have been out of control now for the last 10 years charging what they want...download an app called Grab -e hailing taxi app. Charges you e correct rate and we found them to be very good...worth doing from the airport if you can. Local taxi from airport will charge you over RM 250 which is £50 for the 45 min journey to  KL.  Grab will cost you from RM 65 to RM 110 depending on size of car....airport taxi are there to rip you off....you also have several free buses that have serval routes around central KL which is great.

39,1.0,"We were travelling with family and had kids and elderly. Booked 2 2-bedroom apartments for 3 nights. Arrived at about 4.15pm to check in and the rooms were not ready. Kept telling us that housekeeping is checking on the status of the room. After waiting for 30 mins, we asked to refund so that we could go look for another hotel. My kids were tired and wanted to shower so we really just wanted to check into a hotel. They finally gave us our rooms at 5pm, after an almost 1-hr wait! Got into the rooms and it smelt abit stale. But that was ok. At least we got our rooms. Asked for extra towels, blanket and toothbrush and it took a very long time. We went out for dinner and as I was going out, I asked the front desk again. The staff said that the housekeeping staff is on his way and “he will leave it in my room so when i get back”. When I got back, nothing was there. I called the front desk again and they said “oh we went to your room but you were not in”. I then waited another 20-30 mins, called one more time and then got the towels, toothbrushes and blanket. The next day — the housekeeping staff cleaned our rooms and took the bath towels away but did not replace them. So when we came back from lunch, there were no towels for us to use. I went out into the hallway since housekeeping was still there but their reply “please call the reception to ask for replacement towels”. So I did and again, it took about 20 mins. The aircon in one of the bedrooms wasn’t working but I didn’t bother asking them to check or repair it. I didn’t have the confidence that they will fix the aircon in an efficient manner. So we slept with the room door open and let the aircon from the living room flow though. In summary, it was a horrible experience, staying at Parkroyal Service Suites. I won’t be back.",PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Changkat Bukit Bintang known as the” bar street” is 2 mins walk away and Jalan Alor Night market is also within easy walking distance. The reception staff was pleasant and welcoming. Nothing seemed a problem. Our suite was well appointed, spacious and had a great layout. It had a fully stocked kitchenette with a large refrigerator, microwave, etc. The Wi-fi was always strong and never dropped out. We had an excellent selection of cable channels on the 40 inch flat screen. Everything worked well in the bathroom and we had good shower pressure. A/C worked well and we had heaps of power points. The room was serviced daily and stocks were replenished. The roof top pool was ok, limited seating area but had nice city views.

After clarifying what we wanted, they took another long period of time to come with the pillows and blanket.Day 1: We were told only 2 breakfasts were provided for our room. Had to pay our child's. Paid RM20+ for her to have an egg and a glass of water. Breakfast choices very limited and guests were fighting for the food like it was going to run out any second. Day 2 and Day 3 We did not go down for breakfast at all. Nights 1 and 2: Couldn't sleep well as the air conditioner was making so much noise. Night 3: AC started pouring.

The hotel gym is rather small for the size of the hotel especially that the hotel is targeting the extended stay market.

He then talked to someone on phone, said we need to pack our luggage, and would be given a different room.Cindy helped us by shifting us to the 17th floor family suite 1702.

Gaming room was nice with some good reading options and comfortable lounge area. It is behind the breakfast area so one need to take steps.Breakfast buffet had a decent vegetarian and non-vegetarian spread. Live egg counter was available and chef customized as per requests. The sauce bottles are kept at the end of the spread. The pool area on 30th Floor is too good to hang out at night as views are good and one can spend time in Jacuzzi.Towels are provided. I really liked the blue lighting of the pool and Kl tower with dancing lights, Petronas glittering and pavilion studded like diamond ... everything together creating a magical aura. So after a while we just relaxed in the hot water Jacuzzi. It was my highlight during my stay here.Do have the tamarind welcome drink near reception as it is refreshing after a day trip/ exploration.Bulkit Bintang shopping area/ Petronas are at walkable distance with plenty restaurant options.One day when we came down and realized it was drizzling we requested reception for an umbrella and were provided one.Around 10 pm till early morning the glass door entry is restricted to enhance safety which is good.Our flight was an early morning one so we asked Siti at reception if breakfast could be packed as our package had breakfast.

Location was perfect close to twin towers, pub street, Jalan Alor, Pavillion etc, couldn't fault it as you could easily walk to everything with young kids.the rooms were really great and spacious, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, lounge dining, and a spare room, aircon worked well with aircon's in every room, and a laundry room, with washer and dryer.rooms were cleaned daily and to a high standard.the pool on the 31st floor was nice, but strangely water was cold, probably due to the shade cover.the breakfast was fine, with a choice of bread, eggs, porridge, fruit and a selection of Asian hot dishes. breakfast gets busy from 9.30am, getting their earlier makes it a lot more enjoyable.taxi rank outside the hotel is handy and getting GRAB is super easy.There are mini-marts right across the road for all the sundries you may need, snacks, drinks, washing powder, coffee, teas, etc.The staff were all amazing, so friendly and really went out of their way to help.We used the room service a couple of times for dinner and that was really good.Overall we loved our stay and couldn't recommend the Parkroyal highly enough.",PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Well worth it as it comes with a comfortable sitting room and kitchen with a separate bedroom. The only difference this time round is that I'm on the 29th rather than the 25th floor but hey, it's good to travel and the views are amazing.The check in took no time at all and it was great to see the same friendly team I remembered from my previous visit. You'll read from the other reviews how amazing the pools are and I can never get tired of lying by the pool looking at the KL tower. It's also a great place to be when the sun goes down as you see the city start to light up around you.Breakfast is available on the ground floor and has a wide variety of hot and cold options available.

80,4.0,"We thought we had booked the ParkRoyal hotel, but were quickly corrected by the reception staff.  The suites are just a few hundred metres away but trying to get there by car was a nightmare because of all the one-way streets (although taxi-drivers manage it without difficulty).We were pleasantly surprised when we finally arrived.  The reception is manned but otherwise unimpressive, and there is a ground floor restaurant, which is quite cheap (but eat in the street, the food is better). The suite was large and cleverly laid out, with a bath and a separate shower, and the bed positioned in the middle of the room to minimise noise from adjacent suites. Having siad that the suite was very quiet.  It had a small kitchen and a safe.The bed was large and comfortable, and the air conditioning worked well.  It does have room service but we did not try it.

88,4.0,"These serviced suites are right in the centre of the golden triangle in Bukit Bintang.  We walked everywhere when we were in KL because of this excellent location.  Pavillion Mall, Lot 10 and the KL tower were all reached within 5 minutes walking.  Time Square took us 10 minutes walking.  We even walked to the twin towers, which took about 20 minutes in an air conditioned walkway. I cannot praise the location enough really.We booked a 2 bedroom suite which was excellent.  There was 1 king room with ensuite, 1 double room and then another room with a double sofa bed, which they made up properly so we used it as a third bedroom. There is a full kitchen with fridge freezer and everything you need (except a colander/sieve).  They even provided washing up liquid, sponge and tea towels which similar properties don't.  Then there is a separate room (good for the noise) for the washing machine and tumble dryer.  This room is really large and plenty big enough to store bags etc.  All of this plus a living room and family bathroom. 6 of us (2 adults, 3 teenagers and a child) stayed very comfortably for 6 nights in this apartment. We also had lovely views across the city. We could see the twin towers.  Please note if, like us, you are a large family, it is better to book the 2 bed suite rather than the 2 bed premier suite.  The premier one has a separate office with desk etc.  I think the sofa bed in the separate room is more flexible as it enables you to have a third bedroom.They cleaned every day, replacing towels and bedding and providing bottled water.All of this was amazing!  My only problem with the room is one of the bedroom doors did not shut properly unless locked with the key and the curtains are too thin, bring an eye mask if you like to sleep past dawn.The hotel pool is a rooftop location which has stunning views across the city.  The pool is a bit smaller than it looks in the pictures and was cold as it is not heated at all.  There is a second pool on a lower floor which is also nice. In the lobby there is a mezzanine floor which has a kids lounge with playstation, football table, air hockey table and computers.  We didn't use this but it seemed good.The only downside with this hotel is breakfast.  It isn't that great.  There is an egg station which serves omelettes to order. Fresh fruit selection and croissants are nice.  Other than that, it is a bit ropy.  It seems very geared to a Chinese market, which is odd as the majority of visitors seem to be Arab or Western.  For example, every day there were dim sum on the buffet but not pancakes which the majority of people would have preferred.  Some of the other choices were very weird, like boiled potatoes sitting in water. The breakfast area was too small to accommodate all of the guests.  I would suggest to make the mezzanine area a second breakfast area with a buffet upstairs as well. Despite the just OK breakfast, our stay in this hotel was really lovely.  I would recommend it.  Please request a higher floor as the area is busy and noisy.  We stayed on floor 19 and it was good.",PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Kuala Lumpur Hotel,4.5

Two pools to choose from and the neither overly busy, the rooftop pool was virtually empty most nights and watching the lights on KL Tower were nice while relaxing on the recliners! Breakfast was ok, bit repetitive but they cater to everyone with a large selection of worldwide dishes. The suites are very close to all tourist attractions, Jalan Alor is just around the corner with lots of street stalls to eat from, all the department stores are within walking distance, such as Berjaya Times  Square, Pavillion Farenheit.

Actually the second bedroom was nicer but didn’t have an en suite. We were on the 30th floor and so had a fabulous view straight out onto the Petronas towers. Breakfast was better than we had been led to believe. It was described as being a continental breakfast but there were plenty of hot items and an egg station.Jalan Alor is a short stroll away too.

We weren’t greeted with a smile. We understand that they might be a bit overwhelmed with so many check-ins. We can see that Oasia Suites is understaffed.

44,1.0,The hotel is playing a dangerous gameYou are required to sign in to use the pool but there is noone there to enforce it. A group of 12 played in the pool running on and touching ALL of the sunbeds and chairs without leaving their names or checking temperatures. Staff did nothing to stop this from happening. Not only did it ruin my pool experience but I did not feel safe as there was no social distancing going on and no way of contact tracing. ,Oasia Suites Kuala Lumpur by Far East Hospitality Hotel,4.0

The public area was hardly air-conditioned, certain elevators were not working, some of the shower doors were not working properly, some of the air-conditioners in the rooms were not working properly.    The staff tried their best to make our stay comfortable but limited in their ability to be successful.  Looks like management must step in.  Will not stay there anymore.",Oasia Suites Kuala Lumpur by Far East Hospitality Hotel,4.0
54,4.0,"I stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed it overall. I did see a couple of spots in my room that need maintenance - they look like water damage and I suspect there’s an issue with the pipes. Other than that, my room was great - clean & comfortable. Not much of a view as the window is so small and you can’t really get to it to look out very far. The biggest let down for me was the pool area. The pool itself is lovely, but the pool furniture isn’t great. It’s all hard plastic, there are a few loungers actually in the pool, the rest are chairs & tables. I would’ve liked sun loungers around the pool to make it nicer to hang out. The location is ok - very close to the KL Tower, but not much else - plenty of transport options around and I used grab a lot which was very cheap. There was no shuttle bus provided though, which they do advertise as an option in the hotel info. All of the staff were great - very friendly and helpful. It’s not bad for the price but I think I’d stay in a different area, with a nicer pool next time! ",Oasia Suites Kuala Lumpur by Far East Hospitality Hotel,4.0
55,2.0,"We stayed 4 nights in the Oasia Apartments in Kuala Lumpur last week. A very mixed experience: great location, roomy apartment for 4 adults, okay breakfast, lovely smiley doorman.  However, we had to ask to change rooms as there were rats making a constant scuttling and squeeking sound in the air ducts; the washing machine didn't work; the lift didn't work and we had to use the service lift throughout our stay, One night even this didn't work and we had to walk up the fire exit stairs. The air con didn't work in our bedroom, but was fixed after two calls to Reception. However, the very worse thing (apart from the scuttling rats) was the manner of the Reception staff. They were surly, barely communicated with us and never once gave any apology for any of these issues. They really do need to learn what customer service means.",Oasia Suites Kuala Lumpur by Far East Hospitality Hotel,4.0

Life Centre is about 10 minutes walk.  GOKL shuttle bus stops just opposite Menara Hup Seng.Check-in/out is at the ground floor.  Easy and hussle free.  Need to pay the mandatory tourism tax at RM10.  Reception service can be better.  On the other hand, the pleasant doormen were friendly and full of smiles.We stayed at Premier room at SGD83.34 for 2 adults without breakfast.  At 11th floor, the view was nice but not spectacular.  Room is spacious and homely but a little dated.  However, it is still functional.  A hot plate stove, washing machine, huge fridge and washing basin at the living room.  Bedroom is in a separate room.  Bed is comfortable and clean.  One TV at living room and another TV at bedroom.   All other hotel amenities are provided.  Wifi speed is satisfactory.

59,2.0,"This is one great example of why I think the system of rating for accommodation properties is manipulated on trip advisor and booking.com. Booking. com gives it a 4.8 which is very good but when we arrived at the property it looked as though it needed a make over years ago. Dark and unwelcoming rooms coupled with unwelcoming staff at reception. Surly and no politeness to even acknowledge that you are there. What kind of criteria is used for these ratings? I know the location is good but that doesn’t prop the property rating up. Pool was not as glamorous as in the photos, neither was the gym. The best part of our experience there were the congenial doormen. Always with a smile and helpful.

Staff are very pleasant and helpful and will go out of their way to assist. It is within walking distance of the Twin Towers but if not inclined to walk taxis are readily available but remember to bargain if doing your own booking. The gym and pool are wonderful assets. The cafe’s breakfast buffet leaves a lot be desired.Very limited choices - hot food not hot, cereals taste stale coffee/ tea not good.

64,2.0,"Very disappointed with my recent stay here. I am not. normally one to believe in the 1 & 2 star reviews but most hit the nail on the head! Start with the pros. Great location, door/security Guys were always polite and it has a washing machine. Pros, great location, door staff very polite.Now for the cons.Room was old and tired and no way reflected the pictures on the website. Room (1413) was dirty in a lot of places and had not been dusted in a while. Look at the pictures to see for your own eyes. Tired decor and mould in the mastic around the shower, very dusty under the bed, on the door and the lampshade. Air con unit in room had been leaking down the wall and the plaster had bubbled up and was brown so needs repair.  The picture of the lampshade shows dust all over it and the door I wiped with my hand so you could see the level of dust on it. The picture under the bed shows a massive amount of dust so maybe the cleaner sweeps it all under there! Receptionist on arrival was surly. No welcome, no smile just a miserable looking face. Breakfast was poor and again dining room did look like the pictures on the website. Pastries were left uncovered, food in hot trays were not very hot, just not very appealing at all. Only visited it once, went out for breakfast after that. All the replies on the negative reviews says the manager will pass it on to the team but obviously this is not happening or there are just ignoring him. People might say, why didn’t you complain but if this is the standard of the hotel generally I would have no confidence that any where else in the hotel would differ. One or two little issues are acceptable but this was worse than that or maybe we were really unlucky in getting the worse room in the hotel. It’s a shame as I say the location is great. Decided to cut our 4 night stay to 3 nights and booked a hotel near the airport for the final night. Final tip for anyone reading this and thinking about coming to KL. use the KLGO free bus when you can, use Grabcab for other journeys. If you want to get into the city from the airport use the express or transit train very cheap and efficient. KL is a great city to visit just a shame my travel agent picked this hotel.",Oasia Suites Kuala Lumpur by Far East Hospitality Hotel,4.0

I booked and paid for a two-bedroom but due to your own problem, you didn't offer any solution but down grade your guest! What kind of service is it?After my serious complain to front desk, she finally agreed to offer a connected room for us. We then went to the so called connected room with your bell boy but found out that it was a joke! The room was a one bedroom only!

2,5.0,"We have spent a good 6 months staying here and it felt more like a home than a service residences.The biggest impression Lanson made on us was at every touch point from the security personnel all the way to the sales & front of house. We never felt that we were mass market. Rather, it feels like the Private Banking of the hospitality industry where all the staff are friendly & pay attention to details. Yes, they may not be perfect but they try the best that they can within their means.From the moment we stepped in, our personnel effects were waiting for us in the apartment along with all our prior requests. It’s the sort of feeling u get when u arrive home instead of waiting to check in and shuffling through paperwork. Amenities wise, they provide all the basics & more. What we were impressed with was the amount of thought that went into the details within the room all the way down to the brands they use for their utensils. Stuff which might not usually be included in other serviced apartments such as a washer/dryer, oven, microwave ect were all provided. Their sound system in the living room is phenomenal but it can be a double edged sword especially in the hands of irresponsible users. The rooms were really comfy & spacious with absolutely breathe taking views regardless of room type. From the lounge, u have phenomenal panoramic views with a pool table where residents can chill or enjoy the view during festive occasions especially if there are fireworks.Bedrooms of the one bedroom units face the KL tower with a phenomenal view. Surrounding noise from outside does come in a little but it is still bearable. Minimised a lot once you shut the windows and not even noticeable with the TV or music on.Security are friendly yet tight where you can feel their presence but not in an intimidating manner. They even helped us to move in & tracked us down once when we left our headlights on. Housekeeping has been a mixed bag of emotions between expected & mind blowing. Most of the time, its the usual with their staff leaving our room spotless. But there have been times where blown lights have been repaired automatically without us informing them, dish washer automatically cleared & coffee machine capsules emptied. It may be little things but it’s these things that show they care.All in all, if the lowest price is what u are looking for, stick to Booking or Agoda. But if u want to knock off after work every day & return to a home with a family that cares, look no further. At Lanson, it’s not about making money. It’s about making a difference & going beyond expectations.Our full review is on instagram (@monk3yseendo)","Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon Serviced Residences Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

Some things could have been better at check in, more informative about how things work in the apartment or at least the correct way to log onto the wifi. I put it down to new staff.  But we figured it out with the general instructions on the website anyway. The apartment is clean and well designed and functional, everything worked well- top notch kitchen appliances- and the views were amazing on the 18th floor. I loved the toiletries too. The bed was super comfy and we fell asleep to an incredible subwoofed playlist with the KL Tower lights winking at us. Facilities were great, no complaints. Breakfast was good - it was served in-room due to the MCO and could have been served with less plastic but on the whole we enjoyed the meal. The location offers lots of convenience with eateries and we walked to interesting neighbourhoods with some rare heritage architecture; had a lovely 10km morning walk in the vicinity with a satisfying swim afterwards. The customer service is top notch. The hotel representatives did go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Big shout-out to Mike for your generous gestures during our stay. We are eternally grateful. And guess what- we’re visiting again this weekend! Highly recommended. ","Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon Serviced Residences Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

They were so helpful from day one, especially considering I travelled in the middle of the pandemic and there were so many restrictions in place. They were accommodating, they made sure I had everything I needed at all times and there was always someone to help me out.The pool was closed at first due to the pandemic, but they opened halfway through my stay and I was able to enjoy it, as well as the great cafe they have by the pool, which offers great options for food and drinks.They were also kind enough to allow my cat to stay with me, and even arranged to help with my move to my new apartment. I have only good things to say about the entire month I soent there, and highly recommend it.

Indeed never disappoint me!The bedroom is facing the KL Tower, so relaxed seeing the colourful towers blinking at night while laying on the huge comfort bed. Due to MCO, the breakfast is limited as they served us eggs, salad, hotdog and ham on a plate; fruits in a take away cup. However, you may request for otherstuffs eg cheese, danish and others. Cereals, juices and coffee are free flow. The view from the lounge was spectacular! You wont get hungry here, you can even cook in the room as the kitchen has all equipment from pan, plates, fork, spoon…even equipped with dish washer.We walked to the bar street down the street…chankat bukit bintaang. Lots of choices here and further down will be jalan alor which we had local foods there for two consecutive nights. Its walking distance to Pavillion mall too. The mall was crowded despite during MCO time. We took Grab back which cost us only rm5 I enjoyed the clean room prepared for us, always have staff at the reception to greet you and security to help with my luggage.","Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon Serviced Residences Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

I was in a one-bedroom apartment with a full kitchen - it was really nice to have an oven and dishwasher.The bedroom was large but the study was not conducive to working from home as the desk and chair was a bit uncomfortable. Luckily the kitchen has a massive island bench that doubles as a dining table that I could fit 6 people around and then during the day it was a great office space.The lounge room has a comfortable L shaped sofa, rug and coffee table and has a really nice cosy feel with a great view of the KL Tower and Petronas Towers. The tv had bluetooth installed so I was able to connect to spotify through my phone to play music and also my laptop to play movies and tv shows from netflix. The lounge room also has surround sound speakers.The ensuite bathroom is very luxe and made me feel like I was at an expensive spa resort.The location was great too, a few minutes walk from small bars, gourmet grocers and restaurants. It would take you about 10-15 minute walk to Pavillion or a RM5 Grab trip. Very convenient locationThere is also a shared rooftop space on Level 40-something that has a BBQ, outdoor and indoor entertaining areas as well as a pool table which I used alot.On top of all that, the staff and management could not be nicer.

It is an amazing place to stay, and I have a lot of fresh, fund memories because I only just left Malaysia this August. The facilities are awesome, I’ll miss the gym and the pool. The apartments are large, spacious and well finished with nice furniture and appliances. The view is amazing! Large windows give you a very wide view of the city, yet the windows do open just enough to get in some air from outside if you wish. You would hardly get any apartment as large as the apartments in this property. It is located in a very very quiet and nice place, quiet, yet very close to the bubbly Changkat, Bukit Bintang and the city centre - KLCC areas. Shall I talk of  the staff there? Amazing people! They’ll treat you with respect, befriend you, care for you, do everything to make you comfortable, damn - they’ll even shop for you if you need help. If they thought you were lonely, they’d take you out for dinner, introduce you to other occupants in the property to get you acquainted with them. If you are going to Kuala Lumpur for a short stay, the location, facilities and staff make it the perfect choice. If you are going to be in Kuala Lumpur for long, even better, you’ll have an amazing home there and you would not want to go live elsewhere, I promise you.

66,5.0,"Hi guys, at first-what a perfect stay! We are still so happy. My boyfriend and I left the 2nd. of march to 6. the march in the beautiful Lanson Place Hotel. We had a apartment at the 46. floor. Whoa, that was a view! From our room we could see the big Kuala Lumpur Tower, which filled our hotel room every evening with the light animations. With this view (and that even from our bed in the bedroom) we enjoyed every single second in our room. Bedroom, living room and kitchen are equipped with large windows. A very lightly apartment. What super practical was, that the apartment is not only very big and spacious, but also the apartment is very well equipped. In the room there is a washing machine and a dryer with iron and ironing board (which was very convenient for us, as we are still on the road for a longer time), a cooker, an oven and a microwave. The kitchen is fully equipped with kitchen utensils. From cutlery to various glasses (I only say wine lovers), to pots and cooking spoons, spatulas etc. You eat with your eyes. Oh yes! The view from our dining table was also phenomenal. As well as the view of our breakfast. There was a small extraordinary buffet. We really enjoyed it. Croissants, small sweet filled puff pastries, a cheese platter with crackers and olives, bread with cold cuts, dried and fresh fruit, a nice selection of juices and a large selection of fresh bean coffee. If you want, you can have egg dishes prepared. Which was also great, that we had a great view at the top floor (48. floor), made ourselves really comfortable in the lounge and even played a nice game of billiards. Those who want to relax in another way can of course also use the time in the pool.Everything is very neat and tidy and the staff is very friendly and courteous. Finally, a special thanks to the Resident Manager Mike Chang, who welcomed us with open arms and always looked after us. An extremely competent and friendly resident manager. Conclusion: We would love to come again, as we felt very comfortable in the Lanson Place Hotel.

87,1.0,"Initially I gave this 3 stars at start of stay.  I’ve now reduced it to 1 star at the end of the stay and wouldn’t stay here again. It’s a very high rise building. We stayed on floor 43.  It’s a lovely apartment.  However, we never got a good night sleep for the whole duration of our stay.  There was a loud persistently annoying continuous noise all night every night!!  We couldn’t work out where it was coming from.   But it seemed to come from within their own building system (either the vents, air conditioning system or something else).  Based on sleep deprivation I can’t give it more than 1 star.  And therefore would not stay here again.  The cleaning staff were wonderful. You should always tip them daily.  They do a good job and workers should be tipped (in my view).  The security team also friendly. You do however wonder why the security here is a bit too over the top.  Doesn’t actually make you feel safe.   It has a good car park.  The residence facilities are no different to where we have stayed previously.  We choose to stay in residence apartments.  This holiday, we stayed the first week at Ariva Trillion.  Their hospitality was excellent and it was right next door to a mall where you could shop and  eat - it had Macdonald’s, KFC and Paul’s etc..   Then we flew to Brunei and stayed a week at the excellent Empire resort.  Then flew to Kota Kinabulu (Marriott).  Then back to KL for last 5 days (at Lanson place) before flying back home. Lanson place is near lots of other high rise residences in very close proximity and nothing else. There’s no grocery store, no restaurants no coffee shops near by that you can pop into.  But the continuous persistent noise that led to sleep deprivation, lack of resources near by,  and being placed so high up made the experience terrible.  Just imagine waiting for the lift and then it stopping on every other floor when you’re on floor 43.    It’s not particularly safe to be so high up.  A fire alarm bell went off in the building and it made me panic. Wherever you stay always check your fire exits and escape route.  And make sure everyone knows what to do and where to go.  If you have kids I wouldn’t recommend staying so high up. ","Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon Serviced Residences Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",5.0

Example, I booked via Accor, by right you already have all my details, it should not take long to check-in, but it is still 11 minutes for me. 2) Banyan Tree now under Accor, please allow Pullman KLCC customer to use Banyan Tree pedestrian bridge to Pavillion.

While room was on the residence side, it was an apartment with all the facilities.i.e. Kitchenette, living table, sofa, fridge and whatnots.What stood out for the stay was the a la carte dinner. It was fabulous. We had a wild mushroom soup, a ceasar salad, a tenderloin steak, half a dozen satay and two creme brulee (off menu). Orders were taken by Mr Mous, the restaurant manager of Sedap.The dinner was served by Mr Shariff and his team of attentive staff. Now, amongst the dishes,  the steak and the wild mushroom soup were delectable, hitting every palate. The soup was rich in flavour. I was told the chef insisted fresh mushrooms used. My dining partner ladled up every single spoon. So was my steak. It came with portobello mushroom. The portobello mushroom was grilled to perfection. I asked for extra without being charged. The steak went well with the house pour. I had three glasses of wine which were complimentary from the evening cocktail hours from 6-8pm. To end my meal, the creme brulee was done perfectly. We got two, one is being on the house. Thanks to Mr Mous' arrangement. I had a black coffee to go. The macademica choc cookie was relished.  The dinner was paid half the amount courtesy of Accor plus card.Overall, it was a great night spent. I would not hesitate to dine from a la carte again.P/s: Before checking out, the head chef Mr. Azizan prepared me his spicy Seafood spaghetti with a king prawn. Needless to say. It was so Sedap.

Reservation department was very good, checked with me a couple of times regarding my bookings. My last email to the reservation department was to request for early check-in at noon as well as special requests for higher floor and a room facing away from construction sites or a close-up building. Morning of my check-in I called up to Front Desk to check what time I could check-in. Was told my room would be ready for my early arrival. CHECK-INRoom was ready and check-in process completed quickly. Room assigned was however not satisfactory due to its view being blocked by a nearby building. Thus, I called down to ask for a room change to another view. Reception (Margaret if I’m not mistaken) offered to show me another room and we were brought to room 2430. It had a better view (not so blocked off) and it was also bigger. We gladly moved. I was pleasantly surprised due to some reviews mentioning the apartments being dated in comparison to the hotel rooms. Actually the photos do not do justice to the actual room. The photos make the room darker. It was in actual fact, more cheerful. My room despite being quite plain, was cosy and nice. Bed was comfortable and big. Kitchen well equipped and bathroom complete with all toiletries. A lot of storage. Excellent hot water and strong water pressure. The only thing was I couldn’t alter the temperature of the air conditioners.MEALSClub floor benefits like Afternoon Tea and Cocktail Hour were served at the Junction, which was right by the lobby. It was ok but still a pity since I would have loved the Club Lounge. Afternoon tea consisted of 2 types of sandwiches, a savoury bakery, 3 types of pudding and fruits. Hot drinks as well as freshly squeezed juices like orange and green apple. As for Cocktail Hour, you get drinks like wine, beer, above mentioned juices, soft drinks and hot drinks, 3 types of canapés, cheese platter and fruits. On both days Sue took very good care of us. She was friendly and always made us feel very welcome, and regularly checking if we wanted anything replenished. Breakfast was quite limited, just American and 3 Asian breakfasts. However, we could order more than 1. FACILITIES Due to MCO many facilities were not available. Gym just reopened. Went to check it out but didn’t utilise. Nicely air conditioned. There were towels and bottle waters. LOCATIONExcellent, so close to Pavilion Mall. CHECK-OUTWas pleasantly surprised to find out that the front desk staff had accorded me a late check-out till 5pm without me asking for it. Love it!In conclusion, would I return? Yes, definitely! Especially once the Club Lounge reopens.",Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre Hotel & Residences,4.5
8,4.0,"Awesome service. Highly recommended. One of the few hotels still serving buffet breakfast during covid (yess!). They mitigate the risk by having only their staff to man the buffet stations and serve out the food. It is no more self service. During this time the hotel section is closed off and only the apartments are available (better value for money but more run down I suspect). The jacuzzi pool needs better maintenance: water was dark green and the water jets are powered off before 1pm, presumably to save money. Dark green water = not chlorinated, not clean. Eek.Service in the restaurant was top notch. Kudos to Tommy, Sue and team in Sedap Restaurant. Food was excellent. Seriously. Like caviar! Has some good menu items for low salt and low sugar for those who need it eg. the prawn noodles, children's beef noodles. Useful for elderly to know.Concierge service was also very helpful. TQ so much to Gobi and team. ",Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre Hotel & Residences,4.5
9,1.0,The room are small & pillows uncomfortable. There was no hot water in the shower despite the maintenance came and tried to rectify it once. So we had to shower in cold water. After that we just didn't bother cos it was already very late at night and early in the morning. The checkout takes forever (which I couldn't understand why) and there was only 1 staff doing the super long check out. Staff wasn't even helpful & policies varies from people. My family took 3 rooms here - and all of us were charged on different amount on deposits - varying from 200 to 500. When I questioned the staff on duty all she told me was - it's just a deposit we will refund without any justification. Wil not be back for sure ,Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre Hotel & Residences,4.5

Staff were quick to rectify these after our first night but sadly our second night, the pillows smelled of cigarette. You can also hear construction noise the whole night.

15,5.0,"We stayed only for few nights during our family trip to Asia.  Hotel is very conveniently located near to many attractions with one of the main attractions in KL - Petronas Twin Towers being only 15 min by foot form the hotel. Also one of the KL's biggest Shopping malls - Pavilion is only 3 min by foot form the hotel.  Hotel's lobby definitely has WOW effect - with extra high ceilings providing airy feeling. Check in was quick and smooth. We did have Premium Deluxe room (honestly was expecting bit better upgrade being Platinum Accor member) which was very nice newly refurbished on higher floor with nice views and all modern amenities. Being Accor Platinum members we were entitled to have access to Executive lounge - and this worth separate mentioning - I've been to many hotels around the world in different chains and did see a lot of Executive lounges - this one is definitely among the top. From the size (which is really huge) and ambiance, to unbelievable variety of food and drinks at different times in the day to exceptional service - all was just top notch in this lounge.  Usually having choice between hotel breakfast in Main restaurant or lounge we use to select Main one (especially with children due to better variety of food), however here it was not the case we did choose on all morning Lounge breakfast - it was just perfect. Great variety including dishes cooked to order and at the same time much nicer and intimate setting  - hugely recommend spending little extra to enjoy benefits of access to the lounge.  Saying this beware - lounge is not allowed for children under12. I was shocked when I was informed about this on arrival. Thing is that part of the reason I booked this hotel was access to lounge and it was clearly written on Accor site that lounge in this hotel unlike many others in KL can accommodate children of all ages, so you can imagine my surprise when on arrival I was told that it is not the case and that our 2 sons (which at the time of stay both were under 12) can't enter lounge. It is not without a bit of luck that we resolved the situation - when I was disputing this situation with Lounge manager just by chance Wolfgang (GM of the hotel was passing by) and stopped seeing the discussion.  Once I explained my position in details also showing what is written on Accor site to his credit GM said that although indeed it is not allowed and site just contains erroneous info  as I can show the proof of it on site he exceptionally would allow our family to enter the lounge providing our children will behave well (and they did at the end :) - I dedicated part of review to this case as think this is a great example of exceptional  customer service which is not always the case nowadays - really well done Wolfgang and Pullman team.  Returning to hotel description - it has very nice and quite big (by KL standards) outdoor swimming pool, a lot of food and beverage options, service is really great and hotel is really clean. All in all we enjoyed our stay very much and can definitely recommend the hotel for nice relaxing stay in KL.",Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre Hotel & Residences,4.5

I would like Thank Margaraet for serve me during check in and Mohamad for assist me during my stay, he always ask me for anything that i need and try to fulfill my request.

17,5.0,"Checked in for a night for a short staycation after a long hiatus due to locality. With Pullman Bangsar coming into the end of an era, I thought of coming back here to attest the true hospitality again. Check in and out was a breeze. Room was upgraded and well appointed with welcome amenities. Got the Premium grand deluxe category probably due to the membership of Accor. PKLCC prided itself with a team of dedicated , sincere and hospitable staff who had gone the extra mile in delivering thier services. They had done it impeccably. I am sure any guests who walks in is treated as a distinguished guest. From check in , staff like Farhan n others, Sophia , the club manager came to inform that the room was ready while I was having my complimentary afternoon tea. Sue and Mus was there to assist who kept asking if i need any replenishment. Every staff whom I had come across adopted a very can do attitude. I do believe they serve with a heart. I hadnt felt any of them who wore plastic smiles. My evening cocktail session was served by Tommy and Sue as well as Yinny who came to check if everything was good. A thin malay staff who worked diligently was there to see my needs. Above all, the staff were there to champion customer satisfaction. My evening ended really well with good selection of canapes and alcoholics. The gym room was well appointed. It was 24/7. Didnt get to try that. Breakfast was great. It was an assisted buffet with staff who werr ready to serve. While the spread was not extensive, the variety was good enough to delight any tastebud. Oh, the latte from the Junction Bar was simply delicious. Albeit a short stay, i have no qualms to come back. In fact i am returning very soon in the near future. Thank you, pklcc.

They offer unlimited refill of pastries, fresh juices, coffee and tea during the afternoon tea session from 2-4pm, which is not bad in my opinion. The options for alcohol / cocktail (no more) during the evening session have been reduced compared with pre-lockdown, but I will still give them 80/100. Service is great and special thank to Tommy.

21,1.0,"I've not written a review for ages but this needs to be shared. And intentionally dedicated time for this so people will know.Initially tried to call ALL member hotline to book, was quoted a price cheaper than what i see online so i agreed to let the call agent confirm the booking for me. Everytime the agent could not answer my query she had to put me on hold, in total whole call took almost an hour and at the end i got pissed off because the rate quoted was not available anymore. Even worse when they can't use the card on file tied to my membership and i have to read out my card number on the phone. It was frustrating so i gave up and booked direct via website (after almost an hour on the phone and also getting a return call because the agent realised she held me too long on the phone).In the end, booked an apartment and a deluxe room only to find out later they are at different wings and different lift. Staff via email was very helpful and managed to upgrade the deluxe room to a 1 room apartment (with a fee) in order for both rooms to be side by side.Now, the moment i arrived at the hotel, I was immediately disappointed. Never had I have to wait in any of the Accor hotels during check-in if I've already done an online check-in. There's a huge priority desk there but doesn't serve Accor members only. We were lucky to arrive before the huge crowd came, at certain point of the day the check-in Q goes all the way till the entrance which is ridiculous view for a 5 star hotel.We then checked out the swimming pool as i had my kids with me, upon seeing the crowd i wonder is there any form of social distancing control for the use of the pool at all (the video of the GM mentioning max of 8 person at the pool might be outdated?). We decided we will not use the pool which is a huge disappointment for the kids. This is the highlight for most children when they visit the hotel.Then after going through lifts and walkways which were stuffy,  we arrived at the room The basic essentials were not there or not functioning properly.1. For the washroom, the hot water was not hot2. The sinking in the shower cubicle was slow, at times we have to off the shower for the water to clear.3. Basic toiletries were not there and only available upon request, kitchenette is also super basic (imagine there is no bowls available, they should also throw away the toaster, it's super antic)4. table tops were a bit dusty and we had to wipe them ourselves.Then the next morning, we happily went down looking forward to having our breakfast at Sedap, just to be shocked again by the long Q waiting to enter the restaurant and from far we can see people lining up at the buffet line. I didn't measure it myself but am pretty sure there is almost no social distancing. And the fact that it's a buffet made us felt uncomfortable to even consider the breakfast. In the end, we booked the room which comes with breakfast but never had it, sometimes i just felt cheated but it was our choice so no complains.At checkout, again we had to line up (worked so hard to earn Gold status, in the end, there is no difference in terms of service level). the bill was wrong and if I did not check, would have been charged extra RM200+. While going through these frustration me and my son kept getting bugged by a mosquito which refused to go away. We left the counter with itchy legs from multiple bites.I'll look back at this review again years later and laugh about it but as of now it is just sheer feeling of disappointment as i have been a loyal member of Accor for many years. I have never experienced this before, even Ibis treated me better.Please no need to respond and no need to explain. Next trip is with BonVoy.",Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre Hotel & Residences,4.5

Below are our feedback and comments:Good points- Great locations. 5 mins walk to Pavilion, where you can find lots of restaurants and shops. - Receptionist are helpful and friendly.Rooms for improvements- No welcome platter in the room despite we are the platinum member.- Limited choices of alcoholic drinks during the cocktail sessions. Same set of desserts were served for the past 4 days. - The lounge was closed and the breakfast and cocktails were served at the “Sedap” restaurant area. Despite there were not much guests to attend to, the service was still rather slow. The food served was cold while it is supposed to be at least warm/hot.- Breakfast quality was decent, but there were always some fruit fly flying around the food.- Quite surprised that we’ve been told that there’s no croissant being served for breakfast, in a 5-Stars Hotel!- The peek hole at the door was not working. Cannot really see outside from the inside of the room. Informed the hotel staff, but they just replied they are not sure and nothing much he can do.We’ve been here before in 2019, the facilities, services, overall experiences were good back then. But this time, we felt another way round. We understand that things has changed due to this COVID-19; however, a hotel like Pullman should have at least maintain a min level of service quality. We do hope that the hotel management will take in our feedback and improve. ",Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre Hotel & Residences,4.5

Our flight was in the morning and I dreaded thinking it would be a late check-in. But the ever green, ever friendly, staff was not going to let that happen. We were greeted by Amy, who was wonderful and assisted us with our check-in and a special mention to Cheryl the front desk officer (who recognized me from my previous business visit) who promptly ensured that our apartment was made available. Amy proceeded to inquire about our plans for the day and gave some stellar recommendations for restaurants for our dinner dates. This brilliant experience was not confined to just our check-in, the staff at Pullman are always attentive, caring & have immaculate attention to detail. In all my travels I'm yet to come across such a welcoming outfit. The Pullman's greatest strength is their staff and it's customers service.

Great bed quality. To be noted that there is no view to the Petronas towers anymore due to a new building in construction inbetween.Only noticeable improvement to be made is on the food - not as tasty as in other Pullman hotels in Asia (main restaurant and pool bar).

79,5.0,"Stayed for a week at the Pullman KLCC which was almost a perfect flawless stay.  Booked a hotel transfer from the airport and although more expensive than a taxi it made for a hassle free trip to the hotel with being met at the airport by a hotel representative and escorted to our waiting car  We were met at the hotel by Sophia (ECL Manager) who escorted us to the lounge while explaining the hotels features and facilities for a fast and easy check in.  The room was a Grand Delux with ECL access and was large, tastefully furnished with a mix of differently designed furniture that all blended together.  Being a corner room it had a massive curved panorama window which once would have amazing views of the Petronas towers (like many hotels in KL they get built out) but still had fabulous views. Thank you to Noor (Dilla) from housekeeping for the unexpected surprise in the room it was greatly appreciated. The ECL  is tastefully decorated and open until 10pm for breakfast, soft drinks/coffee during the day, afternoon tea with cocktails and canapes each evening.  At all times the food looked fresh and inviting and was beautifully presented and the lounge was a great place to relax and (children under 12 not allowed).  Service was amazing from all of the lounge staff who were attentive to all guests and nothing was a problem for them at any time.  A big thank you to Sophia (Lounge Manager),Ida,Ang Sue, Alex, Syamir, Flavie, Raihan and of course Kamahl (Mr Kawo lol) who we had many conversations and laughs with, your service was impeccable and Sophia must be proud to have such a great staff (sorry if I missed anyone).  A special thank  you to chef Shah Irwan who was told of certain food allergies I have and always prepared a special dish for me each night to ensure I had a great experience there and these were always beautiful presented and tasted super amazing (I felt a little embarrassed but extremely grateful for his bursting with flavour dishes).  The pool area is on the 10th floor with a large pool, plenty of lounges and a pool bar for food and drinks open until 10pm.  Again the staff there were very attentive to all.  Thank you to Tommy who we had many conversations with (and he makes a great cocktail) always ensuring that our visit to the pool was relaxing and enjoyable and he is a great ambassador for the hotel.

Amy guest officer took the time to actually to suggest places of visit, restaurants that we would enjoy and Raghu the conceige took the liberty of double checking our reservation at dining in the dark.

91,4.0,We stayed two nights in mid-December and were pleased to see the hotel so nicely decorated. A massive Christmas tree and sparkling gingerbread house! We stayed on the 18th floor for two nights. Our room was spacious and clean. I would have liked to explore the rooftop oasis but it was heavily raining during our time at the hotel. One of my favourite parts was the breakfast in Sedap restaurant - I've never seen so much choice before and I've travelled to many destinations! The waitress was also friendly when I attempted to say Selamat Pagi to her so we left feeling quite happy.The only negative was that we did not get our sheets changed overnight - unfortunately we must have signalled for Do not Disturb after mistaking the buttons on the wall for light switches (see picture). As it was only a short stay we didn't wish to make any special requests.

Breakfast was a disappointing meal. Lack to choices, slow refills. The service at the coffee place, the junction is a disgrace. Tables were not cleaned properly and can see stains. Sat there for 30 minutes but no one came to serve. Leftover on tables were not cleaned immediately. Went to lounge, the staff were busy chit chatting loudly instead of concentrating on the guests needs. Rooms were dusty. Hair dryer not provided. Booked two rooms with breakfast and were told that only one room has breakfast. Stayed in so many other Accor group hotels including Fairmont, Sofitel and Ibis, this is probably the worst hotel.

5,3.0,"Stayed here for a quick weekend getaway (March 27, 2021). This was my 3rd time staying in Traders Hotel, after a few years gap. I’ve always loved this hotel mainly due to its location and the comfortable stay. I stayed here during the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and just like any other hotels around the world, strict SOPs are implemented and must be adhered to - which is of course, why not. However, I am not sure why, the check-in process was terribly SLOW. I was only queuing behind 4 guests, but oh dear, it took about good 45-50 mins before it was my turn! Only 5 staffs were attending the check-in process. Apparently, guests MUST provide a copy of IC / passport for EACH and everyone staying in the rooms booked. Well, I do understand this is the rule anywhere, especially when you’re a foreigner. But as a Malaysian, honestly, I HARDLY provide the details of my roomates, family members, etc. simply because it wasn’t requested. Even if I booked a room (or 2-3 rooms) based on the ACTUAL pax staying, usually I was just asked to provide my IC and that’s it. But if it’s the rule, okay I get it but I would highly suggest that Traders highlight this requirement upfront in their booking partners, or emails, or anything - because you know, people won’t be queuing together with their 50 family members in one line for check-in obviously because it’s a bit inconvenient and we’re following the SOP and it’s a mess, inconvenient and embarrassing to run around screaming asking for their ICs. There was this one guy, walking around asking for ICs in a loud volume, creating unnecessary panic and discomfort as if we are a thief checking in illegally into the hotel. The room however, still fantastic. Comfy bed. Good bathroom. Just enough for a one night stay. The crowd is huge though. If you’re looking for a quiet stay, probably weekdays are better choice.

From the second my husband and I came in, we were greeted with so much love by the concierge guys, brought us up to the Lobby, then we got the best Front Office staff, named Mr. Vincent. We checked in at 11pm and he was so so so kind, his hospitality and warmth is really something to look up to. He gave us complimentary late check out, in his words, “so you can enjoy the Skybar” because he knew I was down for arriving late and not getting the chance to go into the Skybar as it was already closed for the night, that was wonderful from him. The room is wonderful, huge bed, amazing bathroom, spacious, everything was so detailed.. Service great, everything great. Didn’t get a chance to have any food there but definitely the next time I will try. My husband and I had a great time. Thank you Traders team ️ keep up the amazing work.

22,5.0,"Had spent a night with family and kids to celebrate my birthday. Stayed at room no 2403 exactly facing Twin Tower. The sky was blue at day and magnificient view at night. Food ordered for room service was awesome. Same goes for menu for breakfast. However, swimming pool and spa were closed following rules imposed by the government due to pandemic. Received complimentary cupcakes & balloons as well. It was so lovely. Thank you!","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

25,4.0,"A perfect staycation experience with Traders Hotel. Everything is amazing right from the cleanliness of the room, staffs who are friendly and attentive and a special touch of sanitization kit apt for the current pandemic situation. Above all, the room with the spectacular view of the Twin Tower was simply stunning. The wide choices of breakfast and the midnight owl menu for dine in was definitely good for those who are awake at wee hours. However, there was one little glitch. My toddler had experienced few bugs/insects bites on his hands and legs. But otherwise, its all good. Thank you for the fantastic experience, Traders Hotel team! ","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
26,4.0,Very satisfied with the room view & everything except that we were disappointed that the new year's eve package that i booked although cost me 2 night rm1400+ which is more expensive than normal rates but there's no fireworks at klcc like usual.

29,1.0,"I have made a reservation since early Sept for a 2 night stay on 31 Dec through Agoda.  I find it strange that the hotel instead of Agoda had billed my credit card directly in Oct 2020 but paid no heed to it.  When I checked with the hotel a few days ago to confirm my reservation, they claimed not to have received payment and requested for payment again.After checking with Agoda and my credit card issuer on my payment which had been successfully collected by the hotel, they still claimed that they have not received payment.  Only when I wanted to file a police report for a fraudulent transaction by the hotel and data privacy breach that the hotel reverted to confirm they have received payment.This is such a disappointment to receive such service  before my stay!  I hope my forthcoming stay will not be another disappointment.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

44,5.0,"Traders Hotel by Shangri-la is not Shangri-la but offers FANTASTIC on point Shangri-la service to their guests. This is a 5* hotel that seems to know you. The duty manager ABBY is a joy to be with, her genuine interaction with the guests generate a homely feeling that is professional, cheerful and a vibrant breathe of fresh air. Breakfast items were limited however, it will be overlooked by the view of the twin tower. THE VIEW, that is an unforgettable stay cay experience. I had a complimentary upgrade to the twin tower view room and was automatically given a hard contour pillow without asking for one. The team does put an effort in viewing their clients profile by providing a true Malaysian hospitality. I feel like this has been my many stays but in fact it was my first. Thank You for knowing me Traders:) and Thank You Abby for that exceptional service. I will be back soon.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

I wasnt expecting much but really touched to see the efforts by the Traders team. Check in & check out process was swift. The concierge team especially those who are manning the buggy services are really cheerful and helpful . The Skybar is a must if you are staying here especially at night as the view is amazing.

","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
57,3.0,"We stayed here for 2 nights  in the tower suite. Overall our experience was ok - not exactly what we expected given it was a Shangri-La property. Service levels were ok but F&B service quality leaves much to be desired and is definitely not up to Shangri-La standards we are used to. What we liked: 1. Room views were spectacular - the twin towers were beautiful from our room2. Location is fantastic - right next to KLCC park 3. Buggy service to KLCC was very convenient 4. Excellent service from reception staff - they were unable to send the concierge to get me painkillers but she took the initiative to offer her own painkillers and asked if I was ok with it - lovely 5. Attentive Traders Club staff What needs improvement 1.  F&B service levels are not up to the standard you would expect in this kind of hotel.  Staff seemed inexperienced. Breakfast staff in particular were not up to expectations.  One forgot our breakfast order and had to be reminded multiple times. On the 2nd day, another staff took our order and it came without sides (they blamed us and made excuses rather than being apologetic). We ordered room service for 2, and they only sent 1 set of cutlery, we had to wait another 10 mins for the 2nd set to be sent, without any apology either.  2. Overzealous temperature checks - whilst we understand the need to be careful given the current Covid-19 risks - the hotel already does temperature checks upon entry into the hotel. They then do 1 more at the 32nd floor check in area, then if you want to take a buggy they insist on taking 1 more temperature check before you get onto the buggy. Mind you all this can happen in the space of 30 mins - we highly doubt you can get a fever in such a short time!  Since they already check all guests entering the hotel - why keep checking?  They also insist we cannot sit together in the buggy as a family due to social distancing.  Silly since we are able to stay in 1 room together!  They also insist we have to keep scanning the QR code each day we are at the hotel even though we already did so on the 1st day. Gosh. It got quite tiresome towards the end of our stay.  To sum up - we are not likely to stay here again but would instead return to the stay at Shangri-La Kuala Lumpur.  Our experience at the Shangri-La KL has always been fantastic and the staff at the Shangri-La Club Lounge has always been top notch. Stay at Traders only if you want the location and views.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
58,5.0,I decided to write a new review because I've been in that hotel like 8 times already and always it was great. Location is fantastic with awesome views from the room with twin towers infront. Staff is great and rooms are big and bed very comfortable. Always I'm in a corner room in high floor that offers you a great view. Wanna express my consistance in their great service.,"Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
59,5.0,This was a very very beautiful hotel located centrally and had a lot of interesting places around. Our room was right opp to Twin towers and had real big windows that offered a mind blowing view at the night. There was a bar on the terrace that served good drinks. We had a great time!,"Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
60,5.0,"We had the ""Towers view"" room, and you can not imagine how close you seem to be to the towers themselves. The view is just amazing and worth the extra money as you only normally visit once!The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, the staff are just amazing and friendly and always willing to help and provide advice.The food is varied and great quality, and if you dine in in the evening at all - the burger is a must (I know its a burger, but it is a good one)!They provide a complimentory shuttle to the towers if required (just along the edge of the park, not far, but appreciated due to the humidity and heat).I cannot fault this hotel, staff, location or anything. Once of the best hotels I have stayed in worldwide.Thank you!","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

62,4.0,"On the recommendation of friends, my partner and I chose to stay at Traders in their Club Twin Towers room for our 3 nights in Kuala Lumpur. After first arriving at the hotel the check in procedure at the lounge was quick and efficient, and all staff throughout our stay were incredibly helpful. With the upgrade we utilised having breakfast in the lounge each day, and used it as a space to relax whilst waiting out the (frequent) rainstorms during our stay. The evening canapes and happy hour also meant we were able to enjoy some snacks and drinks before heading out for the evening.The view from our room was one of the most incredible of our holiday, being able to see the Petronas Towers lit up at night from the comfort of your own bed was spectacular, not forgetting of course that the beds themselves are huge and the bathrooms are fully kitted out. Location-wise, it’s incredibly easy to explore the city, and the concierge are able to provide complementary umbrellas to take out in case the weather does turn.If you can upgrade – do!","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
63,5.0,"This is a fabulous hotel. The hotel itself is modern and clean and the staff are very friendly and the concierge so helpful (we had a little issue with our travel rep and the concierge went over and above to sort it)The facilities of the hotel are of the high standard you would expect. Breakfast is buffet style and choice after choice after choice...The hotel is situated in the KLCC park and is directly across from the Petronas Towers. You can walk there in five minutes through the park.Make sure you book a Petronas Towers view room. There is nothing better than just sitting after a day out and about and watching the sunset and ligts change over the tower, or watching the park during the day and looking at the stunning view, including the fountains.The Skybar is a must for cocktails and we recommend the ""bucket"" of food whilst you watch dusk over the towers and the fountain show.There is also a lovely little cafe on the ground floor on the edge of the park. It's outside but under cover, so perfect in all weathers and serves sandwiches, salads , drinks etc.The location is good, as well as being near the towers (and therefore the Suria shopping mall and the park) there is a metro station (although the signs are a bit confusing - so be aware!), so you can get to other places. You can also walk into the other parts of the city failrly easily within 15 to 20 minutes","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
64,5.0,We went for a vacation in KL and checked-in here. We were given the best room with the best view of the Petronas Twin Tower! Everything was clean! I have no issues at all. Thank you Traders Hotel you made our KL stay very memorable. ,"Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
65,4.0,"The hotel had a wonderful view of the Petronas Towers. Reception staff were friendly and helpful.  On check in we were offered an upgrade to a corner suite for a small amount of money. (This might have been because the hotel was not very busy because of the Coronavirus). Our corner suite was spacious with incredible views, a large comfortable bed and well equipped bathroom. As we were tired we decided to eat in the hotel. The restaurant was almost empty but the service was extremely slow. When the food arrived it was cold and so we sent it back. When it came back again it was still not the standard we expected from a hotel of this class. Our impression of the hotel  was spoiled by the service in the restaurant. Breakfast had a wide selection of international food available. On balance we would recommend staying at the hotel but eating elsewhere","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

Would certainly recommend.,"Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
68,4.0,Modern hotel centrally located for sight seeing . Very enjoyable 3 night stay in a Club executive room .Friendly and professional staff . Excellent service in the club lounge .Fantastic view of the towers from our club room which was spotlessly clean and modern and well worth the extra cost considering the daily complimentary 2 hour bar and snacks.A couple of things prevent me from giving the hotel 5/5 .The 'hot' options at breakfast were lukewarm at best and the food selection is geared more to Asian guests rather than Europeans.The air-con in our room was inefficient .However I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again and would highly recommend it .Top Tip   -  Use the Grab taxis (  equivalent of Uber )  for city travel . Rediculously cheap and friendly drivers .,"Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
69,5.0,"What an amazing hotel Traders is. Clean, friendly and everthing you want from a hotel. Upgraded to a room with a view of the Petronas towers which was amazing.

71,4.0,"The hotel is comfortable and clean and service is good. My favourite of all is the room, the bathroom and the views from room and Sky Bar.However this time round I found 2 things to be below expectations - the breakfast buffet and the leakage in the room which was quickly rectified but caused me to not be able to sleep the night before. I acknowledge this is a problem with wear and tear and wouldn't fault the hotel on this but the buffet breakfast left me disappointed. Food wasn't great and labels were unclear.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

77,5.0,"Hotel arranged our car to and from the airport, which was added to the room charge.  When we arrived at reception for our three night stay, we were asked if we would like to upgrade our room.  The offer included breakfast, free cocktails and snacks between 5 and 7 in the evening, access to club lounge and a room with a view of the Petronas towers, all for MYR730.  I do not regret in any way, saying yes and accepting the upgrade.Our room was 2713 on the 27th floor, with a wonderful view of the towers and the park.There is a good sized pool on the 33 floor, next to the Sky bar.Buffet breakfast was excellent, everything that I could possibly want.There is an electric car, which takes guests from the hotel to the shopping centre (KLCC) just beneath the towers.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
78,4.0,This is a good hotel and if I could I would give it 3.5 stars.  Our room had a great view but was a little dated. Breakfast was disappointing and pretty chaotic - the card system on the tables didn’t work as the over enthusiastic staff cleared your table the minute you left to get something else.....  We paid for a club room and in comparison to others we’ve used it was pretty disappointing in terms of drink choices and snacks.,"Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
79,5.0,Located next to KLCC  and walking distance to the Petronas Towers (you can use the free buggy if you dont want to walk).Breakfast is so good with many different cuisines. Fills you up till dinner time.They say its a 4 star but I would call it a 5 star.,"Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
80,4.0,"We recently staged for one night before heading to Borneo. The hotel is nice with large rooms ( we were lucky to have a view of Petronas towers). We had dinner in the hotel and the noodles were delicious. Not very busy (lack of Chinese tourists)Outside is a lovely park and you are very close to the KLCC mall. The shops are a mix of high end and street market blogged. In the mall is the subway station, we travelled from there to Batu caves (change at KL Central but very easy) for about 5 ringets (£1 at the time) return. No charge to get into the caves so watch out for tours that charge more.We are at Hakka, 5 minute walk and the food was delicious but service very quick. The only negative was the sky bar. Fantastic views to the towers but there are booths at the window so getting one might be tricky. The pool is there too but as it's all indoors it is hot up there. Good views though","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
81,5.0,"I stayed at the Traders Hotel for two nights on my way to Indonesia.  I had two adjoining rooms with my family on the 19th floor with spectacular views of the towers. Breakfast selection was good.  There were measures in place for the coronovirus and that was reassuring.  The location was excellent, joined to the KLCC park and close to the mall.  We managed to get to the top of the Petronas towers and enjoy the lake symphony show every evening.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
82,5.0,"Visited 4 nights begin Feb on route to Australia during virus problem. The hotel was very good with precautions - taking temperature readings on entry to hotel, restaurant and bar pool. All restaurant staff wore masks and gloves. Felt reassured as much as could be. We had a fabulous view of the Petronas Towers overlooking the park - well worth asking for Tower view rooms. The bedroom was clean and spacious - huge bed. We had a good breakfast with large range of choice. We ate out evenings so can’t judge meals. The pool on top floor was enclosed and usually had the windows open - great when a breeze but quite hot otherwise as fans were not always on. Nice view especially at night. The location next to the park is also a great plus. You have a feeling of space and there are some nice spots in the shade just to sit and relax. There is even a fountain and light show. The children’s play area is one of the biggest I have seen. The hotel also has a buggy service to take you around the park to the large shopping centre and restaurants below the Towers - nice when you are just a little tired. ","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
83,5.0,"We stayed here for a two night stop over to see the sight of KL. Great locaiton and weould definatly recomend paying the extra for a towers view room.

Good size rooms, very cean and good location.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

The staff are so lovely, especially Theresa Goh, the Director of Communications at the hotel: she’s a star, so helpful and professional, a great asset for any hotel group. Thank you!The hotel is also very health conscious at the moment with antiseptic gel provided everywhere, free body temperature checks and fantastic room cleaning.The gym has everything one needs and fantastic views too.We truly enjoyed using the running track in KLCC park as well, which is right in front of the hotel: step out and you are in the park! Couldn’t get any closer! Of course the rooftop pool and open air Sky Bar are very famous features of this hotel too.The breakfast buffet is incredibly well stocked and the staff are amazing.We shall be back again and again. Thank you.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
85,5.0,"The hotel was very quiet because of the coronavirus outbreak but the service offered was excellent. The staff were courteous and went out of there way to be helpful i.e. given breakfast in a bag for an early flight out of Kuala Lumpur. The Skybar is also very atmospheric. If I returned to Kuala Lumpur, I would stay here again.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
86,5.0,"We stayed here in our way back from Vietnam and it was a great way to end the holiday. We couldn’t get tickets for the Petronas but in fact we got a much better view from the hotel! The roof terrace and pool is the best place for sunset drinks. The location is great, right in the middle of town, with excellent access to the malls and restaurants. Everything was whst you expect from a hotel of this level- can’t fault it.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
87,5.0,"My friends and I stayed here for four nights. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast is buffet style with a large choice of eastern and western style foods. The hotel is a short walk away from the petronas towers, but also offers a complimentary buggy service, which helps. Our rooms were spacious and cleaned daily. There is a daily tourist tax of 10 riggit a night, and also they require a deposit returnable on check out. ","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

Breakfast  buffet has a huge range of food and last but not least the guys on the concierge desk, especially Badrul, were so helpful. They gave me so much information on where to and what to see,also booking a bus to Singapore for me, all done with charm and a big smile. Thank you Badrul!All in all a great stay and would not hesitate  to recommend.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
89,3.0,"Hi, we were in KL for 6 nights out of which the first 4 days were at another hotel and the remaining last two nights were at Traders KL. The only reason for our change in hotel was for the view of the Petronas TWIN towers.  Though I wanted all 6 days to be at traders but since the cost was too high for a room with the view we decided to split the stay . And I am glad we did because though the room ( deluxe double room ) had the best view of the tower it didnt quite meet our expectations in terms of service .To start with room size was pretty small ( but that's the least of the problem) , I had called in for housekeeping and since I had come back from my trip early I was in the room while the cleaning was going on and I must say I was disappointed!!  There were tags that had fallen down and were beside the wardrobe which the lady overlooked .. there was still sugar spilled on the desk even though apparently she said it had been cleaned .. then even without doing the vaccum she said thank you and left! I had to call her back to tell her to pick the fallen tags and do the vaccum.. Now is this the kind of cleanliness you are offering to your guests ?? Do the guests need to pin point how the room needs to be cleaned especially at times when we know how important it Is to sanitize and keep things clean these days ..no matter how much thermometer checks you do at the hotel entry point it is meaningless if the housekeeping isn't done right!! Secondly, the breakfast buffet is definitely a let down not many options but its great for people who love Chinese cuisine..Location wise I think its good since Suria KLCC and KlCC park is within walking distance..however the hotel provides for buggy service ( which again Is a service I assume is provided by hotels adjacent to the mall).Do try out the sky bar at Traders ..it has some great views and cocktails are pretty amazing . Word of CAUTION- DO NOT SIT AND EAT AT THE CAFE OUTSIDE THE HOTEL ( ONE FACING THE PARK) .. YOU MAY HAVE A LIZARD JUMP ONTO AND CRAWL OVER YOU IF U SIT THERE !!! A LIZARD FELL ON TOP OF MY HUSBAND .. SCARY AND TO THINK OF IT I HAD JUST TAKEN MY CUP OF COFFEE OFF THE TABLE !!!!","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
90,4.0,"Last weekend I visited Kuala Lumpur with my Mom to enjoy a relaxing weekend from the stressful Jakarta. We booked a room for one night at Traders out of curiosity. When we arrived, a receptionist, Michelle Lee assisted us with the check-in process. The process was quick and thorough though she will be much more beautiful if she put on more smile. The room we stayed in I think was the most standard room with the city view (not the twin tower view). The room was great! The design is somewhat vintage and old but still has the luxury feel coming from it. At night, I visited SkyBar which is located in the hotel as well. The place has the best view I've ever seen in KL with the glimmering and shining Twin Tower as your scenery. In my opinion, this is the must visit place for instagramable photo shoot. Staffs and drinks are all great. The greatest part of staying here is the location of the hotel that is a walking distance from Suria KLCC and KLCC Park. Do wake up early in the morning and feel the fresh air when walking through the park! Also, the breakfast was great! Wide variety of foods, attentive waiters and delicious meal. Thank you to Kok Wai for making our omelletes big and fluffy. During check out, a friendly receptionist, Cheryl assisted us with great hospitality. But she didn't ask how our stay was. Overall, 4.5 out of 5. Hope to come back soon..","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
91,4.0,"Stayed at this hotel just one night on route back to the Uk.Only hotel in KL with full frontal views of the Petronas Towers & offers dramatic city skyline views. 33rd floor open air roof top Sky Bar, a little odd that the swimming pool was squashed in the middle of it & some of the seating area around the bar, although the under cover, had got a little wet following a very heavy downpour. That said the views were awesome.Walking distance to the shopping mall & Petronas Towers complex either through a park or covered walkway that connects the conference centre facilities.The shopping mall holds mainly designer shops so don’t expect to find bargains here. Plenty of places to eat & drink if you want an alternative to eating at the hotel. Easy access to the Petronas Towers from the hotel, if you are on a tight time schedule may be worth pre booking the tickets to ensure you get a good time slot. Tickets give you access to the Sky Bridge & then on up to the top floor.  Definitely worth a visit. Traffic is a bit of a nightmare in KL, on the afternoon we were due to leave our taxi driver called to say he would collect us earlier as there was a heavy traffic.  As it happens we left the hotel in a terrific thunder & lightning storm & was held up by 2 accidents on the motorway.  Thankfully we just got to the airport on time.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5
92,5.0,"A two week stay at Traders Hotel in KL was (again) very hard to fault. The location is perfect, close to the KLCC park and all the shopping that one could possibly want. For those ‘of an age’ or just plain lazy like me; there is a shuttle buggy that runs from the side door of the hotel to KLCC shopping centre from 0800 til late.The staff at this hotel are polite and efficient and certainly not overbearing. The front desk staff were all well informed and able to provide cogent information on the location of attractions and services around the hotel.The rooms are well equipped and, if I had to pick a fault, I would say the room lighting was less than perfect. A little dim for my personal preference, especially when working in the room. There is a standard range of TV attractions.Gobo Restaurant on the 5th floor has something for everyone with one of the better buffet breakfast spreads I have seen. The Sky bar on 33 is a great way to enjoy the spectacular views of the city. I will be back.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

94,4.0,"Stayed at Trader's Hotel for a day.  I will give 5 stars for it 's excellent location, friendly and timely service, and superb facilities.  However, upon booking, there was no indication at all that i'd be charged separately for the airport pickup and tranfer when we checked out.  Thought all along that this facility was part and parcel of the hotel's service. This hidden cost therefore marred an otherwise enjoyable experience.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

98,5.0,"My husband always wanted to stay at this hotel for the view of the petronas towers. Upgraded room to ensure view of towers and the view did certainly not disappoint. Hotel facilities good, breakfast excellent choice, gym facilities excellent. Found the pool in the bar area a bit unusual and put us off using it. Tried the sky bar on one occasion but very loud and worried I may slip into the pool when walking around. We were looked after though and when my husband asked about sitting in a booth area with petronas towers view we were accommodated as there was availability. Ate at the Goba upstairs restaurant and food and service excellent. There is a shuttle bus to the mall under the towers but we walked through the park area generally. Would definitely revisit if back to KLCC.","Traders Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",4.5

1,5.0,"Stayed here for 3 weeks in a Thinker Studio - was clean, very modern and staff were very friendly. The breakfast buffet was fantastic in the mornings, and the hotel itself is very nice. There is a rooftop pool and area for sitting to lookout at the view of KL which was amazing! Good option if you are staying in KL and don't want a traditional hotel - it is sort of like an apartment. There is a microwave in the room and fridge, but if you want to do your own cooking then you have to reserve a space in the kitchen. It is also very good for offering laundry service - there are washing machines and dryers present. It is located near KL Gateway Mall which is good, but if you want to go out to eat then you have to travel - there aren't many places within walking distance. It is also located near University of Malaya - we are students so this was useful for us doing a placement there. ","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
2,3.0,"Komune Living was one of my best choices to stay in KL, because of the location, comfort and value. But my third time of visiting is very disappointing. FIRST ISSUE - we can't check-in through the self-check in system after the very long queue because our booking number has changed but not notified. Then, we need to queue and check-in again with the new number. SECOND ISSUE - As we checked in 10pm after a long hectic day of working, NO TOWELS ARE GIVEN and the room floor is not cleaned where water droplets and many hairs from previous tenant can be seen! We requested from the housekeeping twice and waited till midnight but they failed to deliver. As it was our long hectic day of working, you can imagine how we feel to sleep without bathing and with the room floor condition. THIRD ISSUE - When I complained nicely to the reception the next day, not even a word ""sorry"" came up from them and they seem to just ignore.  I would think again if i would revisit this property.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
3,1.0,Our room were only made available for us at 8pm. Forcing us to wait endlessly in the line along with our baggage. The entrance door was locked from inside and we had to find an alternatives way to get into the hotel lobby without assistance from the staff. Insufficient parking forcing us to park our car along the driveway of the hotel. The breakfast was lacked in varieties and does not reflect any decent quality.,"Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
4,2.0,"Great room, fitting for the occasion. The 26 hour staycation package included breakfast for two, which was great. However, they need to do some serious improvements to their crowd dissipation/handling procedures. Upon arrival at the lobby for check-in in the afternoon, I was literally shocked to see an extremely crowded space. The small lobby resulted in close to no allowance for 'social distancing' at all. Only 2 front desk officers were at the reception to handle SO MANY customers, and only two self check in kiosks were available. The queues were long. It goes without saying that the facilities were also crowded.  Having promotion packages is good, but please be ready to handle the crowd that ensues. To check out, you also have to queue at the reception or use the kiosk, so they should consider something like a 'drop keycard' to checkout option.Otherwise if not for the crowd, I would say it was a great place to put up at for a short staycation, be it with friends or family. The room was simple yet satisfying. The downside is that the experience was affected by the fear of having to wait in queues, with not much space for 'social distancing'.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

The only downside is there’s no bottled water in the room and the tv channels are boring.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

It has salad, cereal, half-boiled eggs, veg, fried rice. Basic, no complains, unless one is expecting a Michelin-starred breakfast.The downside, wifi. It is just  s.o.  s.l.o.w.  Maybe it's the area itself? Even my own data is slow, but was very fast when I did a speedtest when I in another part of town. Check-in, hotel was fully booked the day we checked-in, self-check-in machine can't locate our booking, so joined another long queue for assistance from front desk.

The staff at check in just said breakfast will be provided according to the room number so i just left it at that. During breakfast, i was told only 1 person could enter.

There were lots of noise even on a supposedly high and quiet floor - ranging from door opening & slamming, people movement, noisy chats & laughs, neighboring rooms' bathroom noises - and these continued up until 3-4am if I can recall while trying to get some sleep.Additionally and as given a feedback o this before, the aircon was sickly locked at 31 deg C which is not an acceptable hospitality standard, and this was even way higher than our normal room temperature. It took 6-7hours to even reach 27 dec C and couldn't be adjusted further. This is once again unacceptable as it is an enclose area and 27-31 deg C is not fit for guests and will cause unnecessary suffocation/heatstroke.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

Pool had a fantastic view, just make sure to book a slot in advance for a swim. Convenient location, 5-10 minute walk to KL Gateway and Universiti LRT station, which meant easy access to nearby shopping malls. Nice place for a short getaway.Things they can consider improving:- Had 5 functioning lifts but extremely long waiting times, after waiting for 30 minutes, we took the stairs from the 21st floor to the lobby WITH our luggage.- Breakfast spread was extremely limited, understandable given the pandemic season but quality of limited dishes was fairly disappointing.- Only 2 self check in kiosks and 3 staff at check in counter, very long queue and staff was evidently overwhelmed during peak times","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

No microwave or even a single plates but only a sink! Small room but sufficient for only a night stay. Tea/coffee not provided, can refill your water at common area. Bathroom not clean and lots of hairs on the floor. Facilities: Rooftop infinity pool was great but remember to make a reservation! Free carpark for guest.Service: Self check in and out at the kiosk at hotel lobby which is quite convenient. Tip: Not wise to check out around 12pm as you will have to wait for at least 30mins to get into the lift to the lobby which can be a nightmare. The lifts are full and make every stop on each floor.

The views are quite nice from my room, be it facing TM tower or facing Novum condo, there is a large window where you can enjoy the city views day and night. The studio suite has a comfortable super single bed, a pantry and fridge where you can prepare simple meals, Smart TV and hot shower. There is a rooftop swimming pool, lookout deck and gym at level 29, however due to CMCO was not able to enjoy the swimming facilities. The front desk service will be a hit and miss, most of the times they are very nice, occasionally you will meet one that is unfriendly. I am very pleased with the services provided by housekeeping as they are always cheerful, helpful and polite every time I see them. I would say the male housekeepers are energetic in their work and always will help even it wasnt the day to housekeep my room. Security is very good in this hotel, where you have the friendly security checking our tempreatures when we go into the hotel. This hotel is close to a condo construction site, however it is also walking distance to KL Gateway and the Sphere so there are plenty of restaurants and shops to look out for.

I couldn't get her name because she didn't wear a name tag, but you can check CCTV for me like how she handle and assist her guest, NOT ONLY SITTING AT THE COUNTER BY DOING NOTHING!!!!!!!  for me this is unprofessional behavior as hotelier.

The room is nice and all good so far, since i have problem with electric disruption in my house and decided to stay here.

27,3.0,"This trip was a downer after having stayed several times at this property, 1. ""Contactless"" check-in process which still requires us to go to the counter to obtain room keycards (what happened to the kiosk issuance?)2. Inroom aircon settings were locked and tapering at 27-28 deg C for about an hour plus which in any case can suffocate esp in enclosed rooms (having worked in the hospitality industry, this setting is not acceptable as it can cause health hazards leading to suffocation)3. What a ""welcoming"" bad stench from the drainage (in any hospitality-related properties, rooms ought to be inspected and sanitised properly before releasing them as 'fit to stay')Additional checks on the room details showed several corners not dusted nor cleaned thoroughly. One unexpected discovery was the metal railing above the bathroom glass door what looked like moss (!) which again can cause health hazards leading to respiratory issues.Nevertheless, appreciate the technician who followed up with regards to the aircon issues.

I opted the Thinker Studio (super single)Pros:- Room was extremely CLEANN, guess it's also because it's a new property. There was a microwave, fridge, water jug (there is a water filling station near the lifts), and a stool (not the greatest if you intend to work in the room)- Went to check out the co-spaces (kitchen, game room, alfresco, laundro) and it looked really organised and clean, not crowded either. Each room has it's own thermometer scan + MySejahtera app to scan. Didn't actually use any of the facilities tho- Has an infinity pool!- very comfy bed (it's firm but not rock solid), good for those with back issuesCons:- Customer service could improve. Emailed to ask how to apply the October babies promo on their website and no reply. I FB message them, and no reply. Called, no answer (only after 3rd try did I get an answer)- There was a second pull-out bed but no sheets and when i pulled it out, a lot of dust came out with it.

36,5.0,"The room wasn’t spacious at all but was clean and comfortable.Breakfast buffet was provided, not that I’m complaining but the choices was somehow limited and have room for improvement. It would be brilliant if local foods and drinks were served too.However, I truly appreciate their 26 hours staycation package as a late riser and I’m more than willing to visit them again in future","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
37,4.0,"Let’s start with constructive feedback,Good points:Great locations ( walking distance to kl gateway, sphere, lrt), comfortable rooms especially bed and linen, great facilities (game rooms, swimming pool), affordable for both short term and long stay.Limitations:Wifi connection ( slow connection especially for thinker two, Wifi users are limited to 3 devices for thinker two (in which it suppose to accomodate 4 guests), Breakfast can be hectic especially during weekend (suggestion: when hotel is expected to be full, then allow guest for takeaway breakfast to avoid disappointment) Overall: Great place to stay for staycation or long term. Will come back in the future","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
38,3.0,"Firstly the room is very small for 4. I booked a Thinker Two room. The floor isnt properly clean..can feel the dust. Soap dispenser is not working properly but they attend to it very well. I like the experience of self check in n check out. Air conditioning isnt cold enough. Tv channel selection is limited. No netflix. Wifi is very bad even tho its just right infront of TM tower! Even my maxis line also bad. Breakfast is so so..i dont expect much from breakfast selections. Customer experience is 3/5. Not great and not bad either. Plus point - bed is comfortable, game room, swimming pool and other facilities is great. Price is great (promotion period), deco is nice and modern. Location is good and ample parking. (Free parking only for 1 guest car).","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
39,4.0,"The welcome note onscreen was addressing another person. Wondering if the system was dysfunctional or not updated. Fr check-in to check-out, it was still addressing another person.While the kiosk for check-in/check-out facilities are welcoming, there weren't any details on check-in/check-out time on the chits esp those that tie to TA's additional gifts/privileges that I had to call to enquire instead.Other than that, overall stay was pleasant, and great common facilities on level 2. Just disappointed to know that no co-meet/co-work spaces in Malaysia that operates after 6pm. With the present situations, many are no longer following 9-6 kind of work/meeting time, would be good to consider extending the access and use of the co-meet/co-work spaces after 6pm.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
40,3.0,The overall is ok. My honest complaints/feedbacks:1.  The checkin process was not smooth. I was lined up at the reception for couple of minutes to check-in. When I reached my turn the receptionist asked for my booking number and asked me to self-checkin at the kiosk and I’d to que again. I don’t know why he can’t just check me in at the counter since I already queued for quite some times. Or someone can just tell me to check-in at the kiosk earlier. 2. The lift was a nightmare. Even though there are 6 lifts in the building I’d to wait around 15-20 minutes to get a lift from level 20. I even heard some of the guests had to take the stairs because they have waited for too long. 3. Clog in the shower and they didn’t provide dustbin other than just one small dustbin in the toilet. ,"Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
41,5.0,My 3rd stay with Komune for staycation as it was quiet and convenient. Friendly service and clean room as usual. This stay was quite disappointing with screaming kids along corridors and guests squeezing into lift without observing SOPs. Called receptionist twice to manage room above me as the children were screaming and jumping during bed time. Receptionist were helpful and the noise stops after my second call. May need to reconsider the stay if you are looking for quiet staycation during weekend/ school holidays. ,"Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
42,4.0,"Location of the Hotel is very strategic, several malls & restaurants located nearby (KL Gateway, Nexus) But you can also get a taste of some local food nearby the many stalls in Pantai Dalam (Cheap & Delicious!). The hotel itself is very nice, compact/  comfortable rooms, and was also lucky enough to get one with a view of the city! Plus points of the hotel are the infinity swimming pool and the viewing deck on the 29th floor which gives you a clearer view of the city and the common area + cool game/lounge area. Staffs were nice and warm! Options on the Smart TV can be improved. The Netflix app was not available and the channels available were limited. The elevators also took a couple of minutes before arriving. I was staying on a weekday so the waiting time was not too long but it could be a hassle when the hotel is more packed. Everything else was superb!","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
43,5.0,The hotel has very good services and the staffs are all very helpful and very considerate. I accidentally had to check out late and the staffs did not ask for additional charge.

44,1.0,"Worst customer service ever especially the reservations department.  Not only that, they also commit a false advertisement or misleading information in their offer and charge me more than the price that they include in their ""so-called-invoice"". I'm gonna make a police report for that. If you guys want to stay at this place make sure that you dont book direct from their website, because they will charge you more plus the customer service quality is worst, they are not helpful at all.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
45,3.0,My friends and i stay here over the weekend for a city staycation.Good:- Room is compact but pretty nice- Great hotel to take OOTD / Instagram- Polite staffs- Smart TV is pretty ok. Got a few watchable channels. Strongly recommend people bringing their hdmi cable to stream tho.Bad- Parking is limited. People resort into illegal parking outside causing congestion.- Check in a hassle. There is a machine but sometimes it didn't work. Reception is not helpful so they just direct us to (broken machine). So we gotta line up like twice.- Breakfast is pretty bad lol. Like seriously lol i suggest people order grabfood. Line is super long too (but its due to mco so understandable). Breakfast not worth lining up an hour tho.- Overpacked hotel especially on weekend. Good luck taking the lift checking out. It took us an hour lol. Its like staying at Genting First World. Maybe Komune would like to look into sorting out the lift system??- No amenities. I think its too basic? Is it cuz the rate is cheap?- No WiFi (system was down the whole time we were there)Overall it was not good but but not terrible either. Wont consider coming back tho :),"Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
46,2.0,"My 4th time here. Last trip I brought my family. Booked a room for 3 adults 2 children below 5. Room has queen size bed and sofa bed. This is why I said this place can't accommodate large number of guests staying there.- no extra pillows for the sofa bed.no extra blanket or towels. Towel still for only 2pax. So I decided to book another so tht my niece and nephew can be comfortable. - wifi not working (so you'll say just call the reception and ask them! Well.... - called the reception many times, no one answered. (then you'll say.  Go down and complain! Well...- lift was extremely slow. Cause the lift to the room is also the lift to the carpark. Thus waiting for the lift really a waste of time when it's full house. Was at the swimming on the 29th, we then decided to use the stairs to go back to our room on 24th. That's okay. But we ALSO had to use the stairs from 24th floor to LOBBY when checking out cause everybody wants to check out too so 45minutes waiting for the lift is a waste of time. A pregnant lady  waited for soo long I could only offer her my foldable hand fan cause she was telling her husband it's getting hot. And we're not the only one that used the stairs. Even a pregnant lady with her whole family, I clouding mom and dad used the stairs to go down too! It stated that one lift can only 4pax but people don't care anymore so they cramped in there like sardine. Forget about social distancing. Whatever lift opens up they'll just enter of they can fit even if it's going up. If you only you're there to see it. Total madness.- breakfast area was too small to accommodate 400 pax(I asked the receptionist). Had to queue of course. To me, this place is only great if you come during weekdays when it's not busy at all. It's chill and relaxing. Or else it's a disaster. The lift part especially that really stressed me out. Coming here with your parents and kids or wife your pregnant wife is something to reconsider if you're planning to come on weekends. I still like komune but they need to do something about this.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
47,5.0,"This is my 2nd time stay at the hotel. We had a lot of fun at 1st level, play snooker, video games and many more. Breakfast is limited but all ok and follow SOP.

Well Done..!!","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
49,3.0,"Tried booking via the hotel's website (the website has better deals than OTAs) and it was unsuccessful after many attempts, rang up the hotel for assistance and was disappointed with the service. Proceeded to book via Agoda instead. Parking is rather limited. Check in was pretty smooth. Some of the front desk staff could ease up a little. Rooms is decently sized. Bed and pillows are good. Room amenities are lacking, there's no toothbrush provided and toiletries are way below the bare minimum. The TV lacks alot of function for a ""Smart TV"". Breakfast spread provided was decent enough for the price and the food was alright. Service at the F&B joint was great. Housekeeping does a great job too. Overall this is a good spot if you need somewhere to crash for the night. ","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
50,4.0,"It was great experience but room wise quite small, lack of kitchen amenities (I thought it was complete studio). No microwave but there were few cups. Remember to bring toothbrush and toothpaste as they don't provide any of these facilities. There is no mineral water in room. It is clean and cozy. Just that the space is quite small for me. The staff are super nice. From counter to restaurants. Helpful and always smile. On last day, building aircond is haywire, but the staffs handle it well. Although you can see their stress level as they cant give any definite answer. Anyway thank you for still entertaining us calmly at 3am.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

59,4.0,"I've stayed at Komune twice and both times they gave me the wrong room type during check-in when I booked for another type of room or requested a specific bed configuration. While the staff were generally pleasant, it was just unnecessarily inconvenient and annoying because the check-in process takes up so much time before I can finally enjoy the room.Apart from that, everything else was commendable. The room was very clean and comfortable. Room facilities were good, although I expected to be supplied with a few complimentary coffee/tea sachets since coffee/tea making facility were provided (not that big a deal, but would have been nice for the price and standard of such accommodation). The beds were comfortable, enough towels provided, good water pressure in the clean bathroom, TV channels were limited but it was a smart TV that allows you to connect to your own account on the TV apps. Am pleased that the management took care to ensure the Covid-19 prevention SOP were taken and sanitisers are provided in the lobby and lifts. The public areas have a clean, fresh and modern look.Location-wise, it's convenient enough to access basic necessities. It's within 10-15 mins walking distance to the KL Gateway Mall, Nexus Bangsar South and The Sphere, which have decent eating options and a few other amenities. For those with their own transportation, Komune is located just off Federal Highway, so it's quite easy to get to either KL city or PJ. Parking is free, if you are a guest at the hotel.Overall (other than the check-in process which has been disappointing) Komune is excellent for those on business trips or short stays.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5
60,2.0,"Arrived at Komune at 6pm expecting that I'll be enjoying my 26 Hours Staycation that I booked on their website (as advertised online)  only to find out that I have to check out at 11am the next day. Apparently, they cancelled my booking without notifying me because on the email I sent them, I stated that I want to cancel in case it's not for 26 hours. Take note that I called their hotline an hour after I made the booking to confirm if it's for 26 hours just to be sure I won't encounter any issues and the person I spoke with confirmed it. That's why I didn't expect it to be cancelled hehe. So to cut the long story short, had a bit of discussion at the front desk and they eventually let us in after an hour. Situation was handled professionally by Irma and Indra (kudos!) and thanks to them I was still able to enjoy my stay. I loved my stay but to Komune Team, you got to have better CX systems that are seamless, talking to each other, and advertisements that are not misleading. Need to turn your customers into advocates.

On one stay I had to scream over the phone ( after calling a few dozen times) and housekeeping came at 11pm!Every ask is multiple calls and you are lucky if anyone picks. Front staff are excellent in pretending to not hear the phone.Room will not be as advertised. Whatever they claim included is not included when you do check in. They have a lot of excuse such as ‘ you are short stay’. Elevator takes forever. Send your kid to press and wait. You can then take your time and come and the elevator would still not have arrived.When it does arrive, it will be so crammed. Good luck breathing in all that bacteria and viruses from everyone else.Each room definitely has more than maximum allowed occupant.

Noise from street level.Windows that don’t even open an inch to allow fresh  air in.Food delivery and food ride share will ever be able to find this place. They only know southview.

Location has nearby upscale dining, fast food at the local mall (the mall itself is mostly dead but the Bangsar mall is a short drive away. Also note this isn't Bangsar, which isn't easy walk to as a big highway is in the way), as well as street food by the transit stop -- all within 5-10 min walk.Rooms are small but clean and mostly functional. TV has local channels and Youtube, bathrooms have body wash and gel. The idea of the hotel is to spend time outside. To this end they have a game room with PS4, pool table, foosball, ping pong, and arcade with a bunch of Street Fighter games. Also has lounge areas, laundry facilities (for some reason they sell everything but detergent in the vending machines), rooftop swimming pool and gym. Has a kitchen but you have to check it out which makes it hard to grab last minute bowls for instant noodles, etc. Breakfast was decent and varied (eggs, porridge, potatoes, beans, rice, noodles, croissants, fruit, etc), but sometimes inconsistent with the quality of baked goods. Breakfast can get crowded on holidays and weekends but they generally move people quickly (10 min or less in line).Service was generally good, but you might have to check with the lobby a second time. Lots of construction in the area but bedrooms are soundproofed well. Think less full service hotel and more affordable long-term stay, and you'll generally be satisfied. For the price of a long term stay, it's a great value.","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

Hotel seems to offer reasonable monthly rate for a long term stay guests. Hotel staff's service quality requires improvements, I feel. The way they respond to the customers' requests with rare smiles, and tone of voice - I have not been very impressed with their service during my stay since late October 2019. 3 star enough. Wifi in the room is very slow so can't hardly tell that wifi is included. Wifi speed at the lobby is okey.

86,3.0,"I start being regular guest since 26 Dec 2019 till now. It's long time not drop a review in this sites. But this hotel make me trigered to write again. Check in process quite slow due to school holiday seasons . Feel sad to other guest which is family and group. Especially when I ask for city view compare construction view which might be noisy. That time self check in kiosk not yet functional. I found Receptionist already doing the best. For me this hotel should provide the waiting guest complimentry welcome drink or tid bits in restaurant. To avoid crowd in the lobby. Next, the room it's not big as showing in the official website. The online booking agent that I book showing 4 pillow instead of 2. What the modern hotel that not provide basic idea like energy plug on bed Head?! It's worst then budget hotel. U need to choose dreamer category and above to enjoy plug near you while relax or sleep. Credit to smart Android TV, I love it. Next, I keep change room since the water on floor stuck beside the toilet bowl. Its take time to dried. I am not calling for maintainance since the problem can't be solved. Its about intelligent of the interior designer or architect. choose the wrong type of toilet bowl. Next, about safety in the shower. My head is accidently hurt when I bow while shower. Did your side notice the the divider is slightly sharp. Why not to put plastic chrom or silicon or what so ever to avoid next injured to your guest? Luckyly I am not bleeding. You know what is worst? When the housekeeping not clean the plastic mug properly, u can see the previous guest lipstick on it. As u see in picture. Yuck, i am almost vomit when I found that before brush my teeth. This make me  can't wait to reactive this my TripAdvisor. One more thing, what kind of 3* hotel don't provide hairdryer? Even I need to collect it by myself in the reception instead deliver to room. What the different I am ordering outside food  service? I do understand your side not allowed food service to deliver food to room. U know what so funny? I need to bring the hairdryer room to room once in change the room, To avoid request. Self service Laundry is charged doubled compare outside. U don't dream to have iron set in your  room. Not all guest need the microwave and big fridge in the room, but most guest feel home when u provide the iron set in the room. Compare reunite with all guest to use ironing station on 1st floor. For me It's not Muslim friendly when girl need to go there to iron the garments. Credit to open air dine area, game room and affordable vending machine. So bad, Public kitchen is close by 9pm. I think more guest gonna use it on evening time compare morning and lunch time. Lastly, breakfast is not much to expected . It's bad for you if u come on peak season. Crowd of guest and refill so taking time even need to wait for Cutleries . What is the best is when the waitress clean up your table while I am going to take drinks. I am never feel disappointed as that . I said to the girl , why you clean my table when I am not finish yet. You know how long to get the free table?! And she blur, speechless. No sorry  from the girl mouth. I am not in mood to eat anymore plus. It's hard to enjoy your meal while people past and I am  sharing table whit others guest. Chocolate Danish no more served since New year, I asking about that to  f&b staff the best answer I get is they have rotation menu with plain crosant. Hahaha. Before this you served both. Anyway most of the staff is friendly. Not to forget hassle free parking provided and it's FOC. hotel located 10min walk to KL gateway mall or Nexus. 15min to nearest LRT . Good view from sky swimming pool and gym function well. Lobby and walkway to room have  quite nice embient , feel like in the gardens. I am sorry for troublesome, keep change the room.

In agoda wedsite but there's no upfront selection for twin bed selection however they upgrade the room to 2 bedrooms which is good and helpful as they guide us to check in at kiosk.my Friend and I are grateful for the assistance and upgrade with friendly staff.2nd I also got request for early check-in/out and high floor as it is my birthday and wanted to spend more time in hotel. but reception can't seem to provide details if we can do so on the same day of check in, I was told to go hotel to ask personally instead of over the phone. Aren't they supposed to know the updates already by 10-11am if we can check in early if the room is ready?i have to remind them of my high floor requests however they smiled and assisted us politely and welcome us with big smiles so I can't be mad over a small matter right when they are so sweet right? Since I requested for late check out as well upon checking in I was told can check out by 1.30pm but however on the nxt day check out when there's other staff working at reception the lady was not friendly and tell us firmly we need to check out by 1pm otherwise is paid for extra hours. It was rude even she wasn't shouting because she talk to us firmly(without checking?) & unfriendly when I only double checking.I saw her was helpful with a customer to check in but with me during check out on time she refused to help and told us to do it at the kiosk I seek assistance on her to do it for me if can (since she is free doing nothing) immediately showing sour face.

Check in- the check in process was smooth and the Front officers explain to me all of the facilities they have in the hotel. Everything was okay and I like it because it was really fast check in. The room - The room was really small. You need to book bigger room if you are a couples traveler or you travel with your family. Mine was is a queen bed size and it was really small but still okay for me because I’m alone. - Please bring your own toiletries because they didn’t provide it for you. They only provide towels and shampoo. No mineral water or other aminities like you always seen in other hotels. - They provide you with a big fridge and microwave.- My room 1315 have stain on my bedsheets but I’m totally okay because I’m not a fussy guest but please make sure everything is clean before you give the room for other guest. I will attach my pics later. - When I take my shower, the drainage was stuck and the water didn’t flow properly.Game room and gym- This part is very unique. They have game room that you can play with your friends and family. Such as snookers, ps4 if I’m not mistaken and pingpong court. It was really nice. - They also have kitchen for you to eat if you don’t want your room to be smelly you can eat here at level 1. Vending machine and self laundry also here.- The gym was really cool. The gym open 24 hours for the hotel guest. The view was really cool and calm also. Breakfast - The breakfast start at 630am till 1030am. The foods was okay. Don’t expect more because they only have limited choices. For me everything is okay for the price I paid. Overall, everything is fine to me. This hotel near to university station. Can walk about 15 mins to the hotel. ","Komune Living Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

I requested for 2 double bed, called and confirmed but when I checked in it was a different room given, the receptionist had the cheek to tell me it's subject to availability. Then I dont understand the reason I put it special request and called for what.. My sister requested for additional pillow but room service said is subject to availability. We had to go all the way to the reception and ask for it. Asked for house cleaning but there wasnt any replenish of toilet rolls, tissue box nor did they change the towels. Breakfast suppose to starts at 6am but when we went there at 620am it wasnt even ready. In fact, was told to wait another 5 mins. Yes, the price is reasonable, the place is clean but please do no put anything to mislead your guests or giving stupid excuses.

Only one stuff is there to serve the huge crowd. 4. Breakfast is a nightmare. Is so crowded and no places to seat. And once the food refill came back. It's very fast crowded with lots of hungry people once again. You can't even get a hand on the food if you don't force yourself in. 5. WiFi in the room is very slow.

At 10 pm after I had dinner from Starbucks, I came to the hotel lounge to have a seat while I was on a call with my girl friend. Mr Sunder and employee of the hotel as a receptionist was smiling and I wanted to give him chewing gum after handing him it  he complimented saying I was handsome .After coming back to my seat few moment later he comes to where I was seated .He then touched and squeezed my leg.After I was done talking to my girlfriend  I wanted to go into my room. As we were only provided with one key card for both me and my father I wanted to ask for another so I won’t be disturbing my father who was sleeping inside.

It was big and had more than everything that i've paid for, fridge, hot shower, shower gel, coffee & tea, free water bottle, LCD TV, safe, free breakfast & huge window with a view of the streets & Berjaya Times Square. For the price this is the best value for money in Bukit Bintang. The location is very good, 1 min walk from Imbi monorail station, walking distant from shopping centres, lots of restaurant, groceries stores around. Ok it is not perfect, like cigarattes burn on the carpet, slippery toilet floor, and the short bed(I'm only 1.72m tall and my feet came off the bed!), but other than that for the price i paid this has got to be the best in Bukit Bintang you can find. And the staffs are nice & freindly. Met a staff name Naim had a nice conversation with him. A very genuinely nice person.These are the things that made your stay worthwhile.

35,4.0,"Been here a few times. Affordable price and convenient for you to move around. Walking distance to Berjaya Times Square,Lot 10, Sungai Wang.Easy food accessible as they have nearby 711 , one Indian stall and Middle East Restaurant when you turn left out from the hotel.Hotel staff lack of smile but very accommodating as they will attend to your request. They don’t provide toothbrush, shaver and tissue box so please pack them with you. No shower curtain and cubicle so it will get very messy and wet after your shower. Tv channel very limited and aircon coldness is acceptable. 2 complimentary water bottles and coffee/ tea each day.Some chargeable snacks inside the room, it’s not free!!Morning rush hour can be a pain so if you are leaving in the morning please check out early since you need to wait for a long time for the lift. Wifi is a big downfall since no wifi after midnight until breakfast time, so disappointed no connections at all, will appreciate some improvement on this area .Breakfast nothing fantastic but basic breakfast selections with only toast. They provide vegetarian corner and the menu changed alternate days either rice or noodles and fried egg or vegetables mini round omelette. 2 selections of juices and coffee/ tea.The staff won’t clear the table until  after you leave. Definitely will come back. If you spend most of your time outside during your stay, this is the right hotel for you but if you prefer to chill inside the room, this might be not a good choice but for the price, it’s hard to find somewhere else.","Metro Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

The service was great as the housekeeper attend to our requests with smiles. We were lucky enough to catch the very limited free parking spaces provided by the hotel too, which is a major plus seeing that the parking fees around that area were pretty expensive.All in all, good experience, great stay for their location and for the price they offer.","Metro Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

Toiletries and 2 small bottles of water were supplied to us on a daily basis. However, the carpet on the floor in the room needs a good cleaning. As for breakfast buffet, we had the chance to discover the local cuisine which we thoroughly enjoyed along with continental items. The staff is very courteous, helpful and friendly. They were always ready to give us advice and they even prepared us a bountiful packed breakfast on the day of our departure.The hotel is ideally situated and we were able to take the monorail, which is only a few minutes away, to many destinations at a very cheap price.Also, Berjaya mall is very close by which made shopping and dining much easier.Will definitely stay at the hotel next time I come to KL.

Starting from the reception counter where the receptionist was very friendly and process fast check in (10 minutes) to the room I was assigned to was according to my request which the room was spacious and clean. Even though there is no Prayer Mat and Iron and Iron board, I called extension '0' and it took them only 5 -6 minutes to deliver the items to my room. Their service was super-fast. The bathroom was clean as well. Breakfast was good. Where can u get a cheap hotel in the middle of the city with varieties of breakfast spread and a spacious room with clean environment? Highly recommended. It's just that, as for me the hotel better lock permanently the window as when you stay at a higher floor, in case you travel with kids, its a bit dangerous as the window can be open easily and its a risk for children. They might fell down. The management better lock it for the safety of children.","Metro Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

Berjaya time-square is just there and you can spend late hours doing shopping without any hassle cos you don't need to worry about going back to the hotel, it's literally there itself. This place is of walking distance to many tourist attractions in KL, the Pavillion and all the street markets as well. As for the rooms, what I admire most is the view. We got a room facing the time-square and with all the lights at night you cant just look away, it's that spectacular. The rooms were clean and bathrooms were spacious.

61,1.0,"The staff at the reception  ,the Front desk are not professional , they are more interested at there mobile phone to the client , even laughs at you , when you ask information, and talk in there own language ,  girls taking selfies at the reception , even listening to music on phone . When we arrived they just ask for our booking .Not even a welcome greeting , no information about the hotel . Just ask for the payment of the depot at the arrival and give you the key of the room . Just tell you take the passenger lift go on which level where is the room. And live you on your own .Nobody accompany you to give the room and give information about the room . As you step at the reception area , it smell you are at Little India , put some air freshener , please .About the room, have a bad smell, may be the client before us left their odeur. At least the housekeeping could have spray some air freshener  . So we open the window to have some fresh air get in .The window glass panel was not clean , someone left their oily hair print .May be for saving energy , when we arrived in the room it was an oven . And we should have wait for hours to have the room to cool down , with the bad odeur . The mini bar has been switch off . So we switch it by ourself. They don't even tell us how about the hot water , we have to put on the water heater ON. With the door card switch , they could have a least have a time delay for the air conditioning on . And the extractor fan in the bath room is so noisy , as if you are in a windmill . The bath room not clean you can see black mold on the silicon glass panel and on the tile joint. At night , you can heard the next door client take his bath with the water run in the drain water pipe or when they flush the WC. The bath towel smell ,old and worm, need to re new.No refills on toilet paper and there was no handheld shower head.Hotel amenities was minimal , one small soap and 2 mini shower products, fortunately we brought our own .Accommodation -very disappointing for the price we paid. Not spacious , carpet old and stained and need to replace . The bed was fix to one side of the window .So , no space , for one person when need to get out of the bed. Need to do high jump over the other person to get out of bed . Sure this room was made for one single bed , not a double bed.You can see painting detached to the wall panel ,  afraid to get it to your face . Room need to be refresh (painting). Even the corridor , carpet smell and stained. Only wifi in room perimeter and bad . No wifi at reception area and the restaurant area.  At the reception area not enough seat, we have to stand up as the seat available ,already busy with one family. As our pick up transport delay , so have to stand up and wait . Even , the front desk did can for us , their phone was the most important . The porter was a very helpful guy . He should be promote to PR at the Front desk,keep it up man. The Chef cooker very helpful. Very limited on the variety of food at the breakfast.The hotel itself good location , as Berjaya Time Square is on the other side of the road. Starbuck is not far too . This hotel is a slot machine . ","Metro Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

Accommodation-wise it was a bit disappointing. We booked the Executive Deluxe room, which was very spacious and looked as pictures stated, but upon closer look we saw that the carpet was quite old and stained. Hotel amenities was minimal; 1 soap bar, 1 shower cap and 2 mini shower products. The towels were old and worn, no refills on the toilet paper and there was no handheld shower head, but the bathroom was clean and also spacious. The bed and bedlinen were clean and we had good sleeps. Our room had nice views over the city since it was on the higher floors. Front desk employees were neither friendly nor unfriendly, but I must say that the porter doesn't do much whether it concern bags or getting the door. We did book a half day tour down in the lobby for RM60 each and we liked it more that we thought we would, since we ended up being the only ones who booked for the day, making it a private tour.Would probably not opt for Metro hotel again, but it still is good value for money, for the large room and A1 location.","Metro Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

Our room was cleaned everyday and the housekeeping never touch any of our belongings. We had a problem with the wifi though, a bit weak connection at around 11 p.m most of the day. Each and every staff of the hotel were very friendly and helpful. One small problem, that I would like to point out during our stay, was the day before we were leaving, when I went to the reception to ask for the baggage weighing machine, two of the receptionist were already on the phone attending clients, one of the male receptionist ( Won't say his name) was on his mobile phone and he was so busy that he did not even knew that I was there.

The catering service and staff was nice like the first time and breakfast also has improved. I personally recommend this hotel to everyone.

76,1.0,"I'd Book a superior double room (superior !?) upon arrival we checked in and went up to our room which reeked of cigarette smoke despite being non-smoking, the carpet was totally dirty and the air conditioning not working. We called the front desk to complain and they said they would come up to check it out ... 20 minutes later no one came back calling again, we were told they would go up ... 20 minutes later without anyone coming in we grabbed all our luggage and went down to the Lobby to sort this out personally. Once there with a frightful face for the scandal we could do in the lobby we were given another larger room. We went upstairs and it was better, even though the air conditioner the carpet was just as dirty and the refrigerator did not work. In the morning (10 am) we complained that they would change the fridge, we said yes; We arrived at noon and they continued without changing it, again we complained (2 pm) they told us they would immediately. We returned at 8pm and the refrigerator remained unchanged, I called and complained vigorously and within 5 minutes they changed the fridge. The truth is that the attention is appalling, rude and unfriendly to guests. In addition the rooms are very run down and I guess the carpets have not been washed since the hotel opened, as they are a grime, the walls full of marks of use just like the furniture all beat up.Surely you find better options that are for the same money.-----Reserve una habitación doble superior (superior!?) Al llegar hicimos checkin y subimos a nuestra habitación la cual apestaba a olor a cigarrillo a pesar de ser no fumador, la alfombra totalmente sucia y el aire acondicionado no funcionaba. Llamamos a recepción para quejarnos y nos dijeron que ya subirían a chequearlo... 20 minutos después sin q nadie viniera volvimos a llamar, nuevamente nos indicaron q subirían... 20 minutos más tarde sin que nadie viniera agarramos todo nuestro equipaje y bajamos al lobby para solucionar esto personalmente. Una vez allí con cara de susto por el escándalo que podíamos hacer en el lobby nos dieron otra habitación más grande. Subimos y estaba mejor, aunque andaba el aire acondicionado la alfombra estaba igual de sucia y la heladera no funcionaba. Por la mañana (10 am) reclamamos que nos cambiarán la heladera, nos dijeron que si; llegamos al medio día y seguían sin cambiarla, nuevamente reclamamos (2 pm) nos dijeron que de inmediato lo harían. Regresamos a las 8 pm y la heladera seguía sin cambiar, llame y me quejé enérgicamente y a los 5 minutos me cambiaron la heladera. La verdad que la atención es pésima, descortés y poco amable con los huéspedes. Además las habitaciones están muy descuidadas y supongo que las alfombras no se han lavado desde que el hotel se inauguró, ya que son una mugre, las paredes llenas de marcas del uso al igual que los muebles todos golpeados.Seguramente encuentres mejores opciones que está por el mismo dinero.

We choose not to pick the paid breakfast that was offered to us by the hotel because we wanted to try the local restaurants near by (plenty of options) and would cost a lot less than the one in the hotel.Everything is great about this hotel but one thing, the staffs (people at the front desk). Yes, they don't smile to me at all, from the arrival until the departure. One of the front desk person was also BAD at MATH, this is proven when I asked for my deposit change, well I guess he tried to steal/nick MYR 10.00 from me saying by giving me different amount of money. He said ""here's MYR 30.00"" while I only get MYR 20.00 from him, ""bad math"" ! there was no ""magic show"" but he finally gave me the MYR 10.00 remaining.The room size is fair, the cleaness level of the room is rathered average but the bed sheet and pillows are clean and comfy.","Metro Hotel, Kuala Lumpur",3.5

We had to pay 100MYR until 6pm or an extra nights fee until 8pm. We opted for the 6pm option. I looked online and there were still many rooms available that night, so, they were unlikely to resell ours and could have just let us have it until 8pm, but didn't. The staff were the let down of the hotel. We asked for toilet paper which we then had to call again to receive, it took 15 mins for them to retrieve our bags when returning to the hotel, and genuinely aren't very good at their job.

There were two water leaking points in the bathroom (toilet and washbasin), the shower water temp was nearly impossible to adjust, there was a daily shortage of at least one towel, breakfast was ...yes , what can I tell, the breakfast was! The reception crew were nothing more than professionally polite, only two bell boys were nice and smiley (unfortunately they weren't tipped by us and I'm apologizing to them this way), one of two elevators broke those days, no facilities...

0,4.0,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate the Valentine’s day. One of the main reason to choose this hotel on this special occasion was that we wanted to see by our own eyes the magnificent view over the Chao Phraya River, described by many guests for a long time. Although the property itself was a bit old, the other parts, comprising to become this hotel were just perfect in terms of its location, room, food and staff’s services. The hotel was situated along the Chao Phraya River, the main river in Thailand, flowing through Bangkok. Getting to the hotel by a car or a boat was the most convenient way as it was a bit far from the Bangkok Sky Trains or Public transportations. The Icon Siam, a huge and luxury department store was the right opposite the hotel. There was a free shuttle boat service to the Mall from Sri Phraya Pier, where was within the walking distance.We stayed on the 20th floor in an Executive Suit room. The room was divided into two main parts i.e. the living room and the bedroom and it had old-style built-in furniture, but clean and well maintained. Once we got into our room, the housekeeping team had beautifully prepared something special from folding towels and flower on the bed. Views from the two rooms were a bit different. While the more lively and busier river view could be seen from the living room, the quieter view with no high buildings alongside the river was seen from the bedroom side. The property’s location and the room’s position allowed us to enjoy the stunning views of the River not only during the daytime, but also the colourful lights from the Shopping Mall and several river dinner cruises during the nighttime. Such enchanting atmosphere absolutely gave us a memorable picture from the stay. We were so impressed by staff and their awesome services at every part of hotel. Before the stay, the Reservation team, especially Khun Kae and Khun Air had amazed us by their friendliness and support. On the arrival day, once we stepped into the hotel, we had been greeted by an energetic concierge, who led us to meet Khun Pannate, the Assistant Front Office Manager for checking in. The way she served us showed her professional and polite manner. Although she was wearing a face mask all the times, we could feel a very warm welcome from her smile and charm under the mask. Moreover, Khun David, the lounge manager and the staff at Giogio’s restaurant including Khun Bew, Khun Ice and Khun Na were very active and energetic, although the restaurant was packed. There were not so many selections for breakfast, but some Thailand’s street-food-style food such as stir fried pork with basil leaf was wonderful. We could not be happier than savoring the moment of having good food, sipping a glass of wine and watching the moving lives along the river during the sunset and sunrise time here. In conclusion, this hotel is definitely well worth returning more and more.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

4,4.0,"The hotel is quite dated and in dire need of renovation. There was a distinct old carpet smell in the hallway. However, its location by the river somehow made up for it. Great river view from the room and restaurants.Breakfast time was quite chaotic. Try to get seated outside to avoid the crowd and to fully enjoy the river view. Breakfast was standard though - good variety but average quality and taste.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
5,4.0,"Like the review written on Feb 14 by another guest, the hotel was overcrowded and out of control during dining. But I was more dis-satisfied by the GM. I booked the stay Feb12 on Jan30, trying to get the ""Travel together promotion"" 40% subsidised by government. Reservation staff told me not to hurry to pay, deadline was Feb9. I called Feb8 and tried to complete the payment process, but I was told the quota was full. Same thing happened to my booking with another Marriot hotel. I was put on waiting list in both cases. Feb11, the other Marriott hotel informed me the payment link and my booking was completed successfully. There was no news from Sheraton in between. Anyway, I kept my booking and stayed at Sheraton on Feb12 (at full cost) with no subsidised. I emailed the situation to the GM. His working attitude was not down to the earth, kind of out to the sky! He immediately passed along my feedback to subordinate. I emailed him back again over a week later as no update from the hotel at all in between. The GM again passed along my 2nd email to somebody to follow. Another hotel staff tried to call me several times at my private times. The sarcastic thing is the staff tried to call me asking me what do I want and tell/share anything to her. Over to al these confusions created by somebody's miscommunication, I felt it was hopeless to transmit message to this hotel, namely GM, because he kept calling me by phone after creating this confusion, which is a channel I don't prefer, specially to calls without purpose!In conclusion, this hotel didn't care who paid the bill (government or me) as long as the money was received. Secondly, The GM tried to fool me or himself about what happened (to me). Now I don't need the hotel to followup anything, but share my experience here. Thank you!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

Definitely recommend the Sheraton when you travel to Bangkok. Plus you can get good promotion deals recently.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
8,5.0,"The arrival was surprised me since I just open the car door, the bell man (or uncle) came right away from the door to help me pick up all the luggage, not even need my asking.  The front desk is very professional and welcoming, well arranged my request due to partners birthday, they even arrange the maid to help me on the decorations, really appreciated.  There were many guests checkin due to the CNY, but my check in was handled smoothly without any waiting. All the rooms here are facing river and my room is on the 27th floor and facing iconsiam, which is very nice view while chilling at the room. Also, the ceiling to floor window let you feel the view is part of room The hotel is aged, this is not deniable, so you can see the history from the decoration and in room facilities. You can see them trying to meet the new gen needs by set up a 50” LED smart TV, it would be great if they have the HDMI input next to working desk. During the pandemic, Sheraton Club is closed, so the lounge service is moved to the Feast or Giogio depend on the numbers of club room or platinum guest checked in.  Luckily we were in the super busy timing, so the service was provided at Feast in almost “buffet” style which is way to much to spoil the customers. Sheraton provides variety of salads and hot foods such as gra pao beef, Thai curry, fired noodles, also mock tails and deserts.  You could almost have it as an official dinner , only one little thing can be done better-the coffee beans need a change, then everything will be perfect.  Special thanks to the club manager David and his team Ice who took care of us very well during the lounge time. You can feel their passionate of helping and accommodating the guest, I really appreciate that. David’s talk is friendly and make you feel like staying here as home of a very welcoming friend host. While the 2nd night at lounge, Ice could even recognize us and help to arrange entering while we were stuck in the queue at the entrance due to other guests with some issues. Also, I would like to thanks the F&B team help on the CNY dinner arrangement, because i have updated my guest number many times and they helped to arrange it wonderful river front view, all my guests were so glad with the nice food and great fireworksBy the way, the main pool is unbelievable with a depth 3m as hotel pool. So I can do some basic diving practice here and relaxing in the pool since the depth avoid young kids here Anyway, thanks to the Sheraton and the team, it gave me a memorable CNY and partner BD celebration. Hope to see come renovation in the future to be able to compete with newly coming river side hotels. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

11,5.0,"We have stayed in a fair number of 5 star hotels over the past 12 months and the Sheraton Royal Orchid in Bangkok is by far the best, streaks ahead of other known brands such as the Ritz Carlton Riyadh (which was by far the  most disappointing - avoid). The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive, the location outstanding, the room (Executive Club Suite) was good, the breakfast outstanding and the hotel very clean. The management team have managed to maintain a very high standard of covid safety and cleanliness and not, as many others have done, used the pandemic to drop their standards whilst maintains their prices. Bravo to the whole team at the Sheraton Royal Orchid, for making our stay the most relaxing and enjoyable experience across all other brands and we will without doubt return as the Royal Orchid is now on our list of favorite hotels around the globe. Highly recommended and you set the bar for how to run a classy facility as close to a pre-covid experience as we could have reasonably expected. Fabulous!!

With river views and easy access to Icon Siam and Talad Noi, it was perfect for a little escape. I would highly recommend securing a club room as you have a bit more space, view of the river and the club perks. The customer service was great and the breakfast - while not huge (understandable given COVID), it was clean and had a decent variety of food for everyone (including my vegan husband). The only bummer was the construction at the pier, which ruined the relaxing atmosphere at the beautiful garden pool, but I am sure the Sheraton could not do anything about that. All in all, a lovely staycation for us all.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
20,4.0,"Shortly after our check in, we headed for the Garden Pool. The Garden Pool is located at the side of the hotel over a small stairway. It was like a secret garden with a huge pool alongside Chao Phraya River. About 3 years back when the company I work had her event here, I was not even aware that this pool existed. It was 3 pm, our pool time. The sun was high and warmed the water good this cool season. What surprised us was, we spotted a peacock lingering in the garden. The several children, my kid inclusive, excitedly gave chase herding the lone bird around in amazement over the find. The next day, we were back at the pool and there were more peacocks, about 6 of them. I think, by the next weekend, there will be one peacock in every room. True to the receptionist’s words, this is the better of the 2 pools for kids.This Sheraton is kind of vintage. The atmosphere is like my grandfather had once stayed here before. Trendy is not what you will find, grandeur will be a suitable association. Our room is located on the 29th floor and posed on a strategic side that faces west. It is the best direction which gave an awesome view of the river below and a wide almost 180 expanse of the urban-scape. Iconic Iconsiam, we could see the dazzling fountain show in the night from our room. Millennium Hilton was directly opposite, if her dome right at the top is any bigger, it will look like NCC-1701 from Star Trek. An oval desk was placed right by the large window and facing out. I really enjoyed the times I worked on my notebook glancing between view and screen, and half expecting Millennium Hilton to fly away at warp speed. Our room was sizable, enough space for my kid to roll around all over the floor. There is an oversized tub in the spacious bathroom, she enjoyed her bubble bath within. Two double beds we tucked ourselves into for the night, plenty comfy lush pillows, a very good sleep. Lots of proper English channels on the large flatscreen.We had club lounge access privileges. What a shame the Executive Lounge on 29th was not opened. All activities congregated in Giorgio's. A restaurant turned common area for all breakfast, lounge access and dining located on the 2nd floor by the pool. Somehow, it did felt only like an uplifted canteen. I had Fish and Chips for lunch. What was in the menu stated Cod. I am a fish person, I know I was not eating Cod. It was some giant seabass meat. The English meal did not exhibit excellent batter crisp neither. Dinner time, a few options. Thai restaurant, the heavy on the wallet buffet on the ground floor, or enjoy the benefits of club lounge access in Giorgio's. Many guests took on the third, we did. The food spread was not extensive, but we all had a decent dinner. Since it was Covid season and the guests were close to all Thais, it was then real authentic Thai food in the club buffet. Hot dishes were Minced Pork in Chili Basil, curry looking vegetable thingy dish, Spicy Coconut Milk Chicken Soup and Baked Seabass no spicy. With the majority looking fierce and with that minced pork dish that was so potent and authentic, first it sets your mouth on fire, the next day it sets your other end on fire. Awesome real Thai food the way it should be. For the breakfast experience, for me, it was just average run of the mill and I cannot state anything spectacular about it. Anyhow, it was still a good breakfast and I am all positives about it.     Of all the city hotels in Bangkok I had been to so far, this has got to be one of the best in terms of conduciveness if it is coupled to a busines trip. Early in the morning, I sat in the one and only discrete open pavilion right before the stairwell to the Garden Pool. The air was cool, I could hear the river and the birds. An electrical outlet powered my notebook for a good two hours while I was on boosted productivity thanks to the vibes. And then there was the awesome view from the working desk in the room. As a family with young kids, the Garden Pool will be the highlight. And the peacocks too. As a couple, evening time by the outdoor chairs during the cool months sipping cocktails is romantic. For the shopaholic, the pier next door provides complementary rides across to Iconsiam.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
21,1.0,"the quality and the services of this hotel is very disappointing. I had a very horrible experience atBKK sheraton during a business travel last week on oct 2020The hotel staff gave me a room when I stepped into the bathroom, I immediately sense a disgusting smell within the bathroom. The smell is unbearable. In a normal  5-star hotel, there should be people checking the room and making sure everything is fine before a customer walk in. Their room manager came in and checked the room and they agreed with the problems of the room. I immediately called the staff and requested for a change of room.Meanwhile,the lounge food also poor at all and lost my appetite and complained.I wished to speak with the GM of this hotel and I asked them to leave the GM's business card in my room the next day. They agreed but they didn't do it accordingly. Overall this is a very disappointing stay. The experience is leaving me with unaddressed grievances.

The staff at the hotel is warm and always ready to make your stay wonderful!The hotel rooms are cozy and carry the  warmth of the old times and at the same time offering all you expect from a modern hotel, it is infact getting the best of both the worlds. The rooms are fully equipped, spacious and offer some spectacular view. F&B offerings are pretty good, breakfast spread had a good variety, the riverside grill  offers a wide variety of lip smacking food. The Thai restaurant Thara Thong looked quite attractive but unfortunately we couldn't eat there as it is only open for dinner. The hotel has two pools one is a conventional modern pool while the other is a garden pool surrounded by a lush green garden and trees, it's quite a charming spot in the hotel.The access to other attractions is quite easy from the hotel as the public pier for the boat service is just next to the hotel, the pier for the shuttle boat to icon Siam is also next to the hotel on the other side. China Town is at a walking distance from the hotel you can experience the stroll through the narrow lanes.

As a Bonvoy Platinum member, I was upgraded to the 1 bed room suite, which is at the front of the river. And because of the week I stayed. It was a week of the hotel run week of wonder campaign. when I entered the room. I found a cute gift box provided by the hotel. Club lounge has now been temporarily moved to the lower dining room. Male staff of relatively old age. Take good care for me. And pay attention all the time. that above all , Morn than a good place is service mind. I think this is very interesting place. For people who do not want to go far away on vacation. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
27,1.0,"I have been a frequent guest at Royal Orchid Sheraton for the past 6-7 years. This stay was the stay that destroyed every trust and loyalty I have with the hotel. Where I come from, GUESTS are treated with respects not INSULTED at the gates. It’s hard to understand how HURT I felt to be treated like my patronage for the past 6 years does not mean anything to the hotel and treated poorly at the doorstep of a place I consider my second home. I was thinking of giving Royal Orchid Sheraton another chance of REDEMPTION this month since I have trips to Bangkok this October and more trips in December but I decided to try JW Marriott instead and it was very wonderful and perhaps it’s time I change my second home since Royal Orchid Sheraton no longer welcomes Returning Loyal Guest (and I quote “The Hotel does not have returning guest loyalty” said the Duty Manager to my face on my arrival check in.)Most importantly, I PRAY that in the future IF I EVER will return to Royal Orchid Sheraton, the hotel will improve with at least the STANDARD that Royal Orchid Sheraton had shown me in the past or this would be THE LAST TIME I ever come back to the hotel since my long-time patronage to the hotel isn’t recognized anymore.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
28,5.0,"The room has stunning riverside view and hotel has complimentary shuttle boat to the new shopping center which is on the opposite side of the river and a short boat trip away to many tourist attractions like Wat Arun and the Grand Palace. Hote facilities consists of gym, sauna, jacuzzi, tennis court with basketball hoop and two swimming pools but the downside being the Tennis court were constantly booked up throughout the time we requested even though I noticed sometimes people whom may have booked may turn up really late for their session which the hotel could release that time for us to use the court. But what made the stay good was the Staff, from housekeeping, front, door man to the restaurant staff were excellent and provided heartfelt service. Overall clean and comfortable place to stay.

29,2.0,"Why not standard - Baby cot no pillow no blanket, so not a family hotel, compare to other Marriott they do provided.- F&B credit not include tax and service charge, while other Marriott that have same promotion do included- No standard explanation about the promotion either from front or F&B staff, none can give the correct information at first.Why not Green - Actually it is about the FB. It was all you can eat but it also an ordering. You cannot choose what to eat if. So Waste of good food when we asked not to put stuff that we dont want to eat. Such as we want rice for small portions but answer is that we only have normal portions.... there many people who are homeless and have no food, why cant you do something that reasonable.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
30,5.0,This is one of my all favourite hotels in Thailand. It's location is ideally overlooking the majestic Chao Praya River. It is only a small boat trip away from Icon Siam. The hotel has implemented many practices to ensure guests are safe with the 'new normal'. The food at all restaurants are amazing as well as the service. A special mention to the FB Director Mr. Mathieu who took his time to meet us and fellow guests in the restaurants to ensure that we were happy with everything in the hotel.We hope to be back soon!,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
31,5.0,"This hotel often gets stars knocked off by other reviewers because of the rooms & dated decor but I'm happy to give it 5 stars. Here's why...- location is great, on the river, across from IconSiam mall, taxis take you from the door to anywhere, other food places & cafes dotted outside - check in & check out smooth and easy- 2 pools, 1 of which (the garden pool) is a little oasis away from the city. I live in Bangkok city and it's rare to stay in the city and feel like you're not in it. Their garden pool is relaxing and quiet- awesome food. In fact, the best fish & chips I've had outside of England (lunch at the garden pool). Breakfast has more than enough choices for all tastes - thai green curry, fried rice with shrimp, pork buns, eggs, bacon, pastries etc etc. - our room was high on the 22nd floor with a stunning view across the Chao Phraya River. No, the rooms and hotel are not as glamorous as their Marriott Marquis hotel in the city or the Millennium Hilton across the river but they are totally adequate for a good stay. Wifi, air con, bed comfort were all excellent though. If you're expecting and need the most stunning decor then don't stay here. If you're happy with still-decent decor & furnishings plus all the other great things about the Sheraton, you won't feel disappointed. If you want a great stay on the river, great location, friendly staff, nice food, good facilities (gym, pools, spa etc), clean & adequate-enough rooms, good wifi, good air con, 2 relaxing pools to choose from, then don't hesitate to book!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
32,5.0,"After much deliberation, we decied to stay here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary, and what an amazing decision that was. We stayed in the Presidential or 'Royal Orchid' suite and it was immense. 263sq metres of awesome, and the team i.e Mathieu, Natthaya (on our private cruise) were fantastic in organising complimentary meals upon meals, a private cruise and the service from ALL staff was immense. Everyone knew our names, everyone was courteous, everyone went above and beyond and Orhun (the Manager) made an effort to greet us on arrival. The meals were incredible, filet steak was unreal, lobster was best I've ever eaten (and 13 years in Thailand I've eaten my fair share of lobster) and their boat was 'out of service' due to the plandemic, but they took us out on the boat for a private sunset cruise with Champagne and Canopes.Would highly recommend a stay here. I usually stay at the Intercontinental when I'm in Bangkom, and I am a stickler for changing venue after having great service, but these guys were just impeccable. Can't knock it, will be back and thanks again.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

35,4.0,"I found the hotel had a great promotion so I was happy to book this hotel for my work trip to Bangkok last week. As the value for the money is so satysfying and the hotel seemed to be cleaner and newer than pre Covid. The check in and check out was smooth and the room and all the other facilities were spotless clean and well prepared. Only the regret was the service at the restaurant. When I order food for my breakfast, I had to wait literally for one hour until the food were served. It was so hard to catch any staff's eyes in the restaurant, I started to wonder whether they were trying to avoid eye contacts with guests carefully. Taste of western food was not impressive, I'd say 5 out of 10, however Thai food was GREAT.Oh, I shouldn't forget to mention the river view from the room was fantastic!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
36,5.0,"I was so satisfied with my decision to stay at Royal Orchid. It is perfectly located with rooms facing the river. You will find direct boat line to Grand palace and many other sights right in the front of the hotel. Hotel also provides frequent, free of charge, boat line to lavish shopping mall Iconsiam and metro station. Both pool areas are great, as well as on-site restaurant with thai dancers. Breakfast was great with many options and it was nice to sit outside, just next to the river. The rooms are a bit worn, but considering all the pros it did not really matter.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
37,4.0,"I went to stay in this hotel many years back as a singleton and was so impressed with the river view from the room. I went back again this time to stay with my  wife and again the view from the room delighted my wife. The hotel provides a shuttle boat to the nearby sky train station making it very convenient to go out and about.What I noticed was the room looked tired. I saw wear and tear in the bed fabric here and there. The hotel overall looks under-maintained. All in all, I could notice much of the hotel's regression in overall conditions compare to what it was years ago. We enquired for halal food prior to our arrival and was told that halal food was not 'an option'.I found this to be a little disappointing as I would love to see the hotel be more accommodating to various dietary requirements be halal or kosher etc. This hotel was on the top of my list for many years but given the recent stay and experience, I might have to consider other possibilities.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

39,3.0,"I've stayed here several times over the last 6 months. Firstly, it cannot be faulted with regards to value for money. However, some of the rooms are fairly tired and staff seemed the same way. Some staff were wonderful, some were not very helpful at all. The older staff who have been there for quite some time are always helpful. Some of the younger newer staff didn't appear to want to be there at all. At the moment the lounge is still closed. Breakfast is limited but that seems to be due to Covid. Again, it's not expensive so if you have limited expectations you will probably be happy. The views from the rooms are all river facing. The pools and gym are pleasant.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
40,5.0,"Although this hotel is a little old, it has beautiful restaurants, alfresco dining terraces and a beautiful tranquil swimming pool. The location is wonderful being right on the river with amazing views. There is a hotel ferry to take you across the river and also a public ferry pier literally two minutes away. Friendly and professional staff especially in the Italian restaurant also acting as the Club lounge for the time being. We usually stay near Lumpini park, but we really enjoyed being on the river and only a few minutes walk from China town. We were upgraded to a suite which although is a little dated was comfortable but the view is amazing with three huge picture windows. We look forward to returning soon and enjoying the wonderful lounge with great cocktails and food.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
41,5.0,"We stayed at the hotel to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel offered great views of Chao Praya River, overlooking ICONSIAM. ICONSIAM offered light and sound fountain shows in the evenings, and we could easily watch the shows from main terrace areas as well as from our room. Our kids loved the hotel's two swimming pools, particularly the garden pool, which has a  special area for small kids. It was also a pleasant surprise to see beautiful peacocks roaming around hotel gardens and the garden pool. We were impressed with the services of hotel staff, who are very professional, caring, and attentive. The hotel also offered excellent breakfast with many choices, all a la carte per social distancing policy. While we live in Bangkok, we felt it was so worthwhile to take a short break at the hotel. We actually plan to come back to stay at the hotel to celebrate our son's birthday. Kudos to all hotel staff that we met.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

As soon as I arrived at the hotel with a tired body and opened the curtains, the beautiful night view of the Chao Phraya River and iKONSIAM caught my eyes, and rather than tiredness, I felt happy that I had traveled. Above all, the bed was really soft. One unfortunate thing was that the bathroom's magnification mirror was a little small, but it was a good hotel overall. There were many kinds of breakfast, and the elevator was pleasant. However, the air conditioner was so strong that it was a little cold when I slept.한국에서 저녁 비행기로 밤에 태국에 도착했다. 지친 몸을 이끌고 호텔에 도착해 커튼을 열자마자 차오프라야 강과 iKONSIAM의 아름다운 야경이 눈에 띄었고, 피곤함보다는 여행을 다녀온 것이 행복했다. 무엇보다 침대가 정말 부드러웠다. 한 가지 아쉬운 점은 욕실의 확대 거울이 조금 작지만 전체적으로 좋은 호텔이라는 점이었다. 아침식사는 종류가 많았고, 엘리베이터는 쾌적했다. 하지만 에어컨이 너무 세서 잠을 잘 때는 조금 추웠다.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
44,5.0,"I first travelled to Bangkok in 1996 and ended up staying at the Don Muang Mansion near the airport and have been back to Thailand many times over the past 24 years, gradually improving my accommodations along the way. I was back in April of 2018 to visit one of my daughters who was doing a backpacking tour in SE Asia and ended up staying at the Royal Orchid for a couple nights on my way to the islands to meet up with her. Loved the hotel, keep in mind that I had normally stayed in some of the backpacker haunts along Khao san/Rambuttri area for many years prior to this visit. I returned again in 2019 with my youngest daughter and my niece. I had arranged for us to stay on a small guest house in Talad Noi which lasted one night. As we were out walking that first morning we walked by the entrance of the Sheraton and the girls asked me, Do you think they have a pool, to which I replied....yes, I stayed here last year and lived the pool. That was my first mistake and before I know it we were booking into the Sheraton!! The girls loved both pools, views of the river, shops nearby and the bike tour we did with the company just down the road from the hotel. This is a lovely property, has great pools, away from some of the craziness the girls did not need to see and really provided us with a great place to rest up from our jet lag and then move into the next stages of our trip which was a night train to Surat Thani and onto Koh Phangan! I will be back to the Sheraton when I return to Thailand!!! Love this place.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

The Club staff is exceptional, never a chore to go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.  The hotel is always in top shape.clean and tidy.  Some services were unavailable due to the current covid-19 situation.  Hope that ends soon.  The guest rooms, always an upgrade as titanium level member is a welcome and additional joy.  Spacious and with great rooms facing the river.  Thai style accessories make the room warm and comfortable.  Spacious bathrooms and comfy beds with quality linens and pillows.

To have gardens and peacocks around a beautiful pool with a swim up bar and comfortable sunbeds - especially after a long flight is delightful.  The location is still great with fantastic views of the river from your room and the outside bar and lap pool.  The boat to take you to the sky train and the river bus right next door make it so easy to get about the city.  Highly recommended.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
47,5.0,"Our family recently spent two weeks staying at the Royal Orchid Sheraton while in Thailand for the adoption of our son. We cannot possibly say enough positive things about this hotel. The staff was incredible. They were beyond friendly, went out of their way to be of support and service to us, and were extremely professional. Nimit was wonderful for our family and regularly had conversations with us and our son during our comings and goings. Another staff member made a paper airplane for our son one afternoon while we waited for dinner to be delivered. From the concierge to the front desk, from the housekeeping staff to the wait staff at breakfast, we could not have asked for more. The breakfast was delicious and offered great variety. We ate each morning outside by the river where our son could enjoy watching boats passing as we ate. The proximity of the hotel to the river was wonderful. We utilized both the express river taxi and the free shuttle to IconSiam on numerous occasions. They were simple to use and extremely easily accessible. We loved both pools at the hotel and also enjoyed using the fitness center. The service at each was spectacular and the setting beautiful. We were at the hotel during the COVID-19 outbreak and always felt safe and informed. The staff was extremely professional in their handling of this matter and cleanliness thoughout the hotel was outstanding. There was even an attendant stationed in the hotel lobby disinfecting the buttons after each elevator button was pushed or car utilized. All in all, we were completely blown away by the service, the food, and the comfort of this beautiful riverside hotel. Our stay here made our transition to becoming a family so much easier than it could have been.

The value was unbeatable. As elite members we were given a club floor room. The room was very nicely appointed. Our room looked to have been updated. Nice spacious bathroom with tub and shower and had everything we needed. The floor to ceiling windows gave a gorgeous view of the river. The club lounge was also very nice and the breakfast offered was very nice with much more variety than was expected. Same with happy hour where they had a wonderful selection of food........ enough really for a full dinner if you wanted. Service was also very good. Everyone very helpful with anything we needed. We left Bangkok to head to Krabi for 4 days and were able to leave some luggage there as we were coming back. The shuttle boat taking you to iconsiam is very convenient and comfortable. The ride itself is a sightseeing event. It’s easy to hop on river cruises/boat taxis etc to visit sites as well as a quick cab ride to Silom area sites. There are 2 pools, one overlooking the river and the garden pool which was our preference. Overall a great place! ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

The accessibility to their own Private boat taking you up and down the river. To the service either at their extraordinary Breakfast Buffet of many nations, or poolside. Food preparation and service all exemplary. To take the regular boats to the temples you simply walk out the front door and the alley entrance is right there. NO hassle NO fuss.

The staff is very friendly and the breakfast on the Executive floor is really good. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

Icon Siam Mall right across the river is such a lovely complex, ranging from a variety of local food, to high end restaurants and luxury brands. Even if you're not a shopping buff, it's worth visiting. The only issue with this hotel is the location. The best way to travel in/out is by taxi. The river ferry is possible too but you could wait quite long on a weekend as the frequency is slow. It's also further away from known attractions such as the shukumvit area. It's good if you want to stay at the river and plan to visit the grand palace.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

We felt obliged to inform them that we had actually paid for the package.The buffet breakfast was excellent.  Unfortunately the set menu dinner at the Thara Thong restaurant was totally the opposite.

The breakfast buffet was extensive with a wide selection of Thai and Western dishes, and we could enjoy our meal on the riverfront terrace.

We had breakfast for both days included, a room on the 27th floor which also allowed you to have Free drinks between 4:30-7:30 and snacks 5:30 - 7:30 which were both great and was a great addition.

63,3.0,As an old avid SPG loyalist and being the second time in Bangkok really wanted to try this hotel out for the most part because the river views looked awesome! As the days were getting nearer there were some very competitive rates in the city and almost cancelled and tried a more modern property........but I just wanted that river view!We arrived and were able to get into our room immediately - we were also upgraded to a Junior Suite I believe. A gentleman in Thai wardrobe accompanied us to our room. He was a little odd to say the least and wasn't sure what to take of him from the start.The entrance to the hotel is not really grand - it just shows up all of a sudden from a back street. It almost felt like we were entering it from a back lane or something?We entered the room and YIKES it screamed 80's!! Older wood furniture; carpet; the old master light switch that we couldn't figure out; old phone on the wall by the toilet; only one place to put one suitcase the other had to go on a chair or find a piece of furniture; shower was super small and leaked like crazy as the door did not seal; only a wand shower that had absolutely no pressure; old sink and that is it - we had to put any toiletries into the bathtub as there was no place whatsoever to put stuff; room safe was put into an existing drawer that was not big enough so when opening it up you had to hold it open and ensure the drawer did not slide to slam it down?They do have a decent club lounge; very large and staffed very well; we did enjoy this for breakfast and some snacks/drinks in the evening - it does get very busy!We were hoping for a lounge//bar to just sit outside and enjoy drinks along the river but they only had an indoor lobby lounge. We spent time at both pools - the upper pool is fairly basic with loungers surrounding the pool that are very close to each other. The lower pool has trees and feels more relaxing and enjoyed the pool bar down there.I really wanted to like this place and it is in a dire need of renovations! There are so many other SPG/MAR choices in Bangkok that are very competitively priced with a much more modern feel. I think the price point at his place also attracts a little different clientele? I've been looking at this property for years and finally stayed but unfortunately on my next visit to Bangkok I will have to choose something else. It's big and old with not much around it and unfortunately not many areas to be sitting riverside other than the one restaurant in which the menu did not entice us to visit.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

The hotel also has a free ferry across the river to a large shopping mall. Our room was great, we were on a high floor the faced the river - excellent views!! The club lounge was convenient.

Service and check in were excellent. Buffet breakfast consistently good all mornings. Staying here really made our holiday and the good thing was that service and quality were consistent across days and staff rotations. I found the room clean,comfortable and quiet as the river boats and music closed down by 10.30 latest. A definite recommend. Sheraton are delivering their brand well here.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

68,5.0,"We stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay. We were in room 1022 and had beautiful view overlooking the river. The room was very large, with floor to ceiling windows. It was well lit and had reading lights. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom had a large mirror that was well lit, a high bathtub with a hand held shower. But beware of scalding - the hot water is VERY hot. All amenities were provided, with a safe, huge TV having many channels, desk with light.There was a stuffed sitting chair also. The hotel lobby and other areas were very nicely appointed. We had breakfast each day and it was a nice variety. The location is great, with free ferries to take you across the river to the large mall across the way.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
69,3.0,Stayed here one night with friends during a cruise Bedrooms are excellent great mattresses and pillows Fantastic view from 24th floorBeware of prices Everything including rooms carries a 10% service charge and TaxA bottle of wine that I would pay £8 for at home in England was about £100 or £20 a glass Service in bar and restaurant was poor with surprisingly little English spoken for a five star hotel Over all disappointing ,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
70,4.0,"Stayed for three nights prior to travelling back to UK. Wonderful location right by the river. Our suite had floor to ceiling windows  which allowed for great views in both directions  of all the river traffic. Many boats are lit up at night and adds to a great  evening vibe. There is a free shuttle boat that takes you to a shopping complex called Iconsiam. Shopping wise the outlets are pretty much the same as any major city but for foodies and anyone interested in buildings/ feats of engineering it is quite something. Many street vendors and food outlets are a short walk from the hotel.Our room was a little tired and the damaged flooring and iron mark in the carpet was the first thing we noticed on arrival. It did not detract from a comfortable  stay however. The bed was so inviting and delightful  it was a struggle getting out of it in the mornings. Breakfasts are good and with so much variety.The Lounge was very popular and on two occasions was full and we were unable to find a place to sit. The evening happy hours are, i would suggest too short to accommodate every guest who takes drinks before dinner. The two swimming pools are lovely and I even had a roving peacock come up and say hello, thankfully before the awful din they make!!Staff very efficient and welcoming.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
71,5.0,"This was my second time in this amazing hotel. Royal Orchid Sheraton is one of my favorite places in Bangkok. The staff is so kind and friendly, the room is really big with the most comfortable bed ever! We had the best view looking at the river, and the breakfast was just amazing! There was plenty of food to choose, and the restaurant near the river was just beyond the words. The best lobster we ever tried!Also, there were two swimming pools, so we could choose which one do we like the most, and we had amazing time there, drinking some cocktails and enjoying the quiet time, just relaxing. I can’t wait to come back again, because this is my favorite hotel in Bangkok!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

Impeccable cleanliness, exemplary service, friendly concierge - make the hotel attractive to many individual tourists and groups. Rooms with river views are especially attractive.  The hotel restaurant surprises with its variety of international and Thai cuisine.  A wonderful evening on the terrace overlooking the river and the brilliant shopping complex ICON SIAM","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
75,5.0,"Just stayed here for 6 nights. Wonderful hotel. Great location by the river with free boat to Iconsiam. Really enjoyed Club lounge and Riverview restaurant. View from room on 28th floor was great also. By far the best thing about my stay was the Garden Pool with the Peacocks. They were so entertaining to watch. Very unusual sitting on a sun lounger and all of a sudden a peacock walks past you!!! Brilliant and very unique!! The staff are all lovely and really nice too particularly in the pool bar. The service is very speedy too. Hotel room, grounds and facilities are excellent. As a solo traveler I felt completely safe the entire time here. Hotel is joined to ferry terminal so very convenient to go on evening river cruise from here. Also next door is public taxi boat that takes you to attractions eg. Wat Arun, Khao San Rd. (Ticket is less than 50p!). The entrance is in between the hotels 2 pools so couldn’t be closer really! Will definitely visit again soon. Thanks for a wonderful stay ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
76,4.0,"The hotel is in a great location right by the river. The hotel shuttle runs every half hour across the river to the Iconsiam & then down to the Skytrain Station. At the Iconsiam you can pick up the hop on hop off ferries to all the riverside attraction. Travelling on the river is probably the fastest way to get around Bangkok.The hotel itself is pleasant enough although the rooms are a little bit tired. However, all your needs are catered for toiletries, tea & coffee etc. The towel are amazing really soft & fluffy not like some of the thread bare ones supplied in some hotels. My husband in Coeliac and they had gluten free cereals & bread available at the breakfast buffet. If we visited Bangkok again, which I seriously doubt I would stay at this hotel again.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
77,4.0,All rooms have wonderful river views. Excellent comfy beds. Good size rooms. Restaurants right on the river although a little pricey. Breakfast with huge choice but food was only ever luke warm. Very useful river shuttle to the Skytrain and Iconsiam shopping centre. Excellent street food at front on hotel. Easy and interesting walk to China town,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
78,5.0,"We stayed at this hotel for our last night in Thailand. We wish that we would have spent a couple days in Bangkok. The hotel offers a complimentary boat shuttle to the designer mall across the river and to a major boat taxi stop. China town is a short walk - we enjoyed the street vendors and outdoor market. We didn't make it to the neighboring jewelry stores before 5pm but heard from other hotel guests that there were some good prices. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating they even called us a taxi for our 4am trip to the airport. The only con we have is the shower - the temperature fluctuates from burn your skin, to cold, to back to your set temperature.  But we would definitely stay here again on our next trip!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
79,4.0,"Service and quality is what you would expect with Sheraton.  Situated on the river Chao Phraya and not far away from Chinatown, this hotel has a very convenient location.  Multiple places to dine and a free boat shuttle are all nice touches as was the very accommodating staff.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
80,4.0,"The hotel is beautifully situated at the shores of Chao Phraya river. It has its own quay and bout that takes you over to the new chopping centre ICONSIAM on the opposite side of the river and a little down the river to the sky train station. About one 100 meters from the hotel is the communal quay that is frequented by several boats and boat lines. This is also a small shopping centre with many antique and art dealers among others. All the rooms have a river view due to the very smart layout of the building with only the corridor windows heading to the city. The junior suits that are on the club levels, from 17 and up, are spacious with a living room and a bedroom and places to put your clothes and other stuff. The bathroom is also pretty large with a good shower area and also with a bathtub for traditionalists. They are probably a tiny number nowadays. However, the furniture and the carpet look old and not very attractive. This together with the carpets in corridors and other public areas devalue somewhat the impression of the hotel and should be updated. Otherwise the hotel looks good and lives up to its five-star level in the lobby, restaurants, the gym and pool area. The club levels have a own dining room at the 27th floor for breakfast and drinks in the late afternoon. When you also can get a lot of different snacks together with your drink. Very nice indeed, so I do recommend picking one of these rooms. One very important quality of this hotel is their staff. They are plentiful, competent, helpful and very nice.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
81,5.0,"Great stay and upgrade to club level (27th floor) floor with lounge access.Free boar shuttle every 30 min to Iconic Siam Mall across the river, plenty of food options. Chinatown is walkeable from the hotel. We went to see the Golden Buddha there. Hotel food was good, the restaurant dining options looked great but we didn't get to try it. Plenty of free water, spacious rooms, comfy bed and large TV. Great river / city view from our room.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
82,4.0,We have been visited Sheraton hotel the hotel was nice and good maintained. This hotel included with two Salt Swimming pool and we would like to recommend for business group will be better. Here have complementary boat service to shopping mall & BTS train station nearby. But unfortunately the hotel area is not good So Noise all day & night the smelly for the river was not good. The stay period we had to early check out due to this problem and staff can not do anything to make you comfortable to stay even we informed to them twice time until we decided to early check out. Thank you to provide beautiful hotel for take a wonderful photo ,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
83,4.0,"By the river Chao Phraya and not far away from Chinatown, this hotel has a very convenient location.As with many Sheraton Hotels around the world, a partial renovation would improve, but the price is right for Bangkok at it current stage.A very good option to be close to the lively river and with a complimentary shuttle river to Sapan Taksim to catch the BTS (elevated mass rail transport).","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
84,2.0,"I’ve stayed at this particular hotel many times in the past and despite it being a bit old I’ve always enjoyed it. Also it hold some sentimental value to me. However, It’s just not very good anymore and next time I’ll try something else (eg Shangri-la where I stayed two weeks ago which is so much better or something newer). Since I stayed at Sheraton Orchid last time (1 year ago) it’s just declined in terms of standard, service, quality etc. Overall just not a great experience. Here are few of my experiences to back up the claim:1. Made an order through room service. After an hour nothing! I then called room service only to be told off that they had never received an order from me. Then I spoke to the manager and the order came 15 mins later. What I received was just horrible. Cold, tasteless and what was supposed to be a spaghetti carbonara was just spaghetti with cream pored on top. I sent it back and left it at that. See pic. 2. Speed of service at the pool is ridiculous. On two occasions I waited 15 mins (kid you not) before they came and took my order despite having had eye contact with them. Sometimes the staff is nowhere to be seen and you’re just sat there. I’ve also gone up and asked for service only to be sat there waiting again. If the staff would just walk around and make sure everything is in order and if guests have what they need they will make a lot more money. 3. Had a drink at the outside bar. I received a drink filled with rotten mint leaves. I obviously raised this but there was not much response and it was just left there. Finally, the hotel just seems a bit dirty overall. I know it’s a bit old but it just seems a bit miss kept - beyond the point where it’s just the old charm.I really think the management needs to get their house in order and bring this hotel back to its high standards. They are really not doing much for the brand and it’s global reputation. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
85,5.0,"I’ve been bangkok several times but It’s my first time to visit this hotel. I liked this hotel very much. Excellent breakfast food quality, convenient free shuttle, big shopping mall nearby, perfect riverside view and more.Also the lounge staff was very nice  and they asked me about my needs and filled them in every time. One thing I want is that official Facebook messages or official email replies are slow","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
86,5.0,We've been here 4 times in the past 20 years and it is still as good as ever. Location on the river right next to a boat stop. We love travelling up and down the river on the boat busses. 15 baht each and great fun.We've stayed on the club floor every time and sipping cocktails on the 27th floor watching the sun set on the river is still a magical experience. Prices remarkably good. Two lovely swimming pools by the river. Only negative is hotel restaurants typically expensive with bland food. But a couple of decent places just outside and taxis very cheap to get around in. ,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
87,5.0,My husband and I stayed at Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel for 2 nights as a part of Luxury Escape package.It took 30 minutes from the airport.(8pm)The staff was very polite and friendly. The room was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was dated but a staff told us that they are expecting to have renovations in the near future. Hopefully they can update all the bathrooms.The dinner at Thara Thaong was very nice!The complimentary boat services were very good. We didn’t use any transports on land.I wish we could have stayed a couple of more nights and spent more time around Bangkok.We would recommend Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel to our friends and family!,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
88,3.0,"We have been travelling to BKK for some 30 years and have stayed at the Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel numerous times during this time.We absolutely love being on the river and have shared many holidays with family and friends here, as well as travelling just as a couple.  The old staff are always welcoming and genuinely interested in how you have been.  However, we have never witnessed such a steady decline in service as this hotel has over the past five or so years.We used to receive a personal letter from the Manager welcoming us “home” - gone.We used to receive a fruit bowl with lovely tropical fruit - gone.  In May last year we received 2 apples and in December 3 bananas!We used to receive a certain amount of complimentary laundry each day - gone.Children weren’t allowed in the Club Lounge during cocktail hour- gone.  We went to the lounge one day to organise transport and were shocked at the amount of children with their families who appeared to have taken over.  I thought this was supposed to be an oasis for quiet respite.We were given a photocopied piece of paper with the lounge rules on it and were advised that strict dress rules applied during cocktail hour.  We knew these rules already and have always respected them.  We noted that children were now allowed in the lounge but not in the bar area.  Well I’m sorry, during our stay EVERY night there were underdressed people and children (in the bar area).  It may have been the Xmas/New Year holiday break and you were busy,  but rules are rules.  Two lounges were operating during this time.  We went to Level 26 where there was a definite lack of seating for guests.  It is grossly unfair to expect paying adults to stand with a drink in one hand and a plate in the other and somehow manage to enjoy themselves.  It was noticed that no Senior Management entered this area during our stay.  I would probably avoid the very unhappy guests too.Having said that, we had dealings with Tang (Rooms Manager) who was very professional and understanding.Our Suite was well appointed but I have to say, in much need of a refurbishment.  We have been saying for about ten years now “surely they will start renovating soon”.  The hotel desperately is in need of an upgrade.  Having said that, the room was very clean.Watching the river with the night lights on is mesmerising.We had breakfast mainly at Feast.  The choice is extensive and well presented.  This restaurant also is in great need of renovating.  The only thing I didn’t enjoy about Feast at breakfast time was the noise due to the amount of people.  Sadly, the poor decor and noise made it feel like a budget cafeteria.  There only appears to be three long standing staff members who show genuine excitement at seeing you again.  We are grateful for that.  The other staff show no interest in their job and on three occasions I asked questions (could you please ask someone to look at the toaster), (is there a Sunday Brunch this weekend) & (can I please see the wine list) - all with the same response - “okay” but no action?I must say, we usually avoid hotels that encourage to large tour groups in buses.  These groups tend to overrun the lobby and dining areas.  The ROSH does accommodate these groups but appears to segregate them at breakfast, but the groups still seem to block walkways in the lobby areas with total disregard to fellow guests.We have become increasingly disappointed in the blasé way guests are now being treated.  We have been in business (albeit small business), but we were always grateful for customers who showed loyalty.  We certainly acknowledge their loyalty and show gratitude.  You are in the hospitality game but have let this lapse.  This is your game - you need to get it right.We use the hotel car for airport transfers, we use the restaurants and bars at the hotel and we use the laundry facilities every day at the hotel.We must thank people like Nimmit and all the staff at the door, Ice and the ladies in the lounge, Tuk at Feast and Sithichon who always comes and says hello when he knows we are there.  These are the people that keep us coming back.We were talking to another hotel manager upon our return who said when these things start happening you may need to upgrade your choice of hotel - perhaps he is right.  What used to be an excellent hotel is not so good anymore.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
89,1.0,"This hotel gives the Sheraton brand a bad name, disgusting service from the front desk staff, i had booked a room facing the river side on New years eve through a third party website with a pay at hotel option, at first the hotel did not want to honor the booking and said they were fully booked even though we had a confirmed booking and then finally after the third party website pushed them they gave us the room and charged me the full price immediately, even though it was supposed to be payed at the hotel in local currency on the day of check in, i called the hotel and talked to the manager who said they can do what they want as its the third party website's fault to mention that its cancellable and pay at hotel, as i had already planned to stay i didn't make an issue about it and confirmed with the staff that my room was river facing and facing the Icon Siam mall as i was planning to stay with my family including a small toddler and wanted to see the fireworks from our window in order to avoid the crowds, they confirmed i would have a view of it and that was the end of it.When i arrived at the hotel our nightmare began, the hotel was chaotic, as i was in line i could already sense things will not go as planned, when i reached the check in counter i was told they were no rooms available facing the firework and i would be put in a room facing the other direction, i tried to reason with them but they became aggressive and started talking rudely and called us liars , the behaved extremely bad with me and my wife due to which we lost our temper , the manager at the front desk should honestly be fired, she was the most unprofessional and rude individual i have ever come across at any hotel and these type of people should not be hired in the first place, i will not lower myself and mention her name on here but the management knows exactly who i am referring to. At the end of it me, my wife and our little child stood there for almost 2 hours, fighting with these people, who disrespected us, talked rude in front of other guest and didn't even try to help or compensate us in anyway , a simple, im sorry sir we don't have a room available that you requested but we can give you an upgrade, or a free night stay voucher or anything would have been a nice enough gesture, but they didnt care or bother.At the end of it we demanded a refund and the hesitantly gave it to us to get us out of their hotel as they didn't want the other guest to see the truth regarding this unprofessional property,  the only people that were civilized to talk to were their senior manager who was a lady and their main hotel manager who was a foreigner, even for them they did not offer any apologies or anything and tried to protect their staff who had treated us so badly.The only people i will compliment would be the bell boys who were nice and quick and helped us to get out of that terrible place quickly.if there was a rating worse than 0 i would have given it, i hope this review is read by the management and action is taken from the HQ of Sheraton, i have already emailed the head office of Sheraton and also reported this property and these individuals to the relevant authorities in Thailand.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
90,5.0,Had a two night stay at the Sheraton. The room was clean and modern while the view of the riverside was simply awesome. Sat at night simply watching the world go by and then realising I simply must get some sleep !!! Staff were amazing and helpful. Breakfast buffet was very good with lots of variety. We ate late on arrival at the lounge bar on the ground floor and the food was averagely priced as well as the drinks for such a high class hotel. The grounds were very nice and although being in central downtown Bangkok the swimming pool Area and gardens are a oasis of calm and relaxation. We had a great stay also the shuttle boat is handy every half hour to cross the river to the Siam shopping centre and then onward to the nearest sky train station. The hotel is also conveniently located by the pier for the river boat taxi to get around town via the river.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
91,5.0,"Wouldn't hesitate to stay here next time in Bangkok.View of the river is great always something to watch. One side of the hotel is the river taxi pier. The hotel has it's own free courtesy launch every half hour from 10.00 am which takes you across the river to the very large new shopping centre Icon Siam (great food stalls in the lower level) and to the nearest metro station. The sound,light and water show outside the Icon Siam in the evening is brilliant and free.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
92,3.0,"We have travelled to Bangkok numerous times and habe stayed in many of Bangkoks 5 Star Hotels such as Shangri La, Peninsula, different Anantara Hotels etc. Having stayed at the Sheraton for three nights we have to conclude that this hotel cannot be claiming 5 Stars compared to what other Bangkok hotels have to offer. The Sheraton seems to cater mainly for Chinese Tour Groups, thus the guests are not in a 5 Star range. The hotel ambiance is overall middleclass, lobby more a Tourist-Mall ambiance, rooms and public areas are worn and shabby, so are the pool areas. Do not get me wrong: If you are expecting a 3.5 Star hotel you will be happy, but if you have ever experienced true 5 Star hospitality in one of the many truely fabulous Bangkok hotels you will end up very disaoppointed. Breakfast quality is mediocre, the whole atmosphere is rushed, noisy and not relaxing at all. Sorry dear hotel management, but please visit Shangri La next door or any of the Anantara properties to see how things should be done if claiming a 5 Star rating. The only positive: the Staff does it‘s utmost to cope with all the downsides and have always been lovely.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
93,5.0,"The Royal Orchard Sheraton delivers everything you would expect from an international chain. Large room, comfortable bed and good service.  The breakfast is a huge international buffet and can be enjoyed outside on the terrace or inside.  There are 2 pools, good for cooling off after a day's sightseeing.  The hotel is walking distance from Chinatown and next door to a jetty where the river taxis stop so easy access to the main old city sites and also the leisure complex downstream.  The hotel has a free shuttle service linking it, the shopping mall IconSiam and the BTS station. An e all rooms have a river view, river taxis and long tail boats during the day and the brightly lit party boats at night. I got a special deal which made it worth staying in a 5 star hotel but the best really was the access to the river and the ease of getting around.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
94,4.0,"The Royal Orchid Sheraton boasts of great views over the river, proximity to the boat pier, and a fantastic selection of fruits.Unfortunately, the check-in at the lounge (for Bonvoy guests) takes a long time (I prefer speedier 2-minute check-ins at reception), and there is a lot of noise at night from outside that gets into my room, but management informed me that they're renovating the hotel to reduce the noise.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
95,4.0,"Last time I was here was almost 15 years ago and I remembered the luxurious rooms and facilities. Now I'm back again and the rooms are very well kept, the pools are awesome,i think there's one new one since I was here last time.They now have one fresh water pool and one salt water pool.The fresh water pool is full of kids and flies as there's no wind here, but the saltwater pool has neither and is a great tranquil place to be.Sound proofing in the room isn't the best so if you're a light sleeper and want to sleep in you might be woken up in the morning.Hotel staff is awesome, except for the lack of smiles in the bar downstairs they all were very smiling and service minded.I would give the hotel a full score if it hadn't been for my shower being moody, it changed between scolding hot to ice cold so there was no relaxation there. I was constantly alert as I was suddenly in a siberian ice bath and a few seconds later I was in the hot springs of costa rica. I told the hotel through the Marriott app and they said they'd send someone to look at it but there was no difference the next day, same moody shower.I will definitely stay here again, given the shower is fixed.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

45,5.0,"This was one out of five hotels I stayed at over a two month span. The Quarter Ladprao by UHG ranks at the top of them all. It very well may be one of the best hotels in Bangkok, especially when considering the amenities provided, the location, and the reasonable rates. Sure, not everyone's experience during their stay here is going to be the same but I think you'd really have to be searching for something to criticize to not enjoy yourself. The rooms were spacious and decorated in modern chic. The gym is fully functional proper gym. The pool is a rather nice size and presents a very comfortable area to lounge around. I thought the food was above average overall. The staff is terriffic- gym-side, poolside, in the restaurant, the housekeeping team, and the front desk staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful and always greeted guests with a smile. My most frequent interactions were with Mild, Chat, and Art at reception. They were service-friendly and did their best to address all of my inquiries and requests. They represent the entire Quarter Ladprao team extremely well. Good work Quarter Ladprao Hotel!

56,3.0,"Very good location, near MRT and BTS, new hotell. Good breakfast, but I am not totally happy with the service:After finding out that our bathroom and toilet was not cleaned, took pictures and went down to the reception to complain, asked a boy there that I wanted to talk to the manger, he told me that he is not here, what can I help you with?I told him the story that when I came back to the room after a long day in town and putting on the cleaning sign, putting the towels on floor (as a sign that you want a new one as told in the hotell card) I see that its not cleaned and I have still the old towels just folded with the same dirt on them. He said ok sorry I will tell the manager and tried to look away.I don't know what's going on, but I expected that he came with the solution, but no.Then I told him what now? can you get some one to fix this. after that he turned backh and said ok.what is this? I don't need to ask for this, He should come up with solutions.Next I asked for a Thai massage service that they had with a A4 ad and price list , it was full booked for now they said, but they could fix this next day at 11:00. guess what nobody showed up the next day after waiting and changing of day plan. After another complain, they arranged for 20:00. the lady showed up 20:10 finally.By the way, never saw that they clean the room floor.I don't know why this happened, but I expect dem to be more professional.Never heared from the manager.","The Quarter Ladprao by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
57,5.0,"This hotel is great, not only is it super reasonably priced for the service and amenities on offer/ location, but the overall feel of the hotel is that of a quality hotel.  I loved the gym, the pool and the restaurant, and of course the room was great.I am a bit of a conservationist, so I don't really like wasting material things.. This is why I was happy to see that the shower gel, shampoo and soap were all refillable.   This was great, because there was no waste in product packaging (also the three items were quite luxurious, made from really nice ingredients, that didn't dry my skin or hair at all).The front desk staff are really friendly and helpful.  I stayed for about 10 days in all so I kind of lived there a bit, Som in particular was so helpful.  She helped me plan where to go, how to get wherever I needed, and just general pleasant conversation, which I really appreciated.  All the staff did as much to make my stay as comfortable as possible. There was one funny incident (the first 3 days when I stayed on a different floor before moving).  There were two really loud women that were shouting/ talking at around 1-2 am.  I guess this sometimes happens (it's Bangkok) so maybe they were just rowdy from the night.  Apart from that all the guests were classy and kept noise to a minimum, or just enjoyed themselves without causing trouble to me or anyone else. All in all, a great place to stay, just outside the blue line (MRT) line, you get off at Phahon Yothin exit number 1 (this is incidentally the connecting station for the green BTS line, which is a 10 minute walk along the skywalk/ on the road/ or via the the mall if you go before the mall closes (at 10pm).  It's 1 minute outside exit 1 of the MRT line.  Very convenient.There's a 7-11 outside, which is great for all your daily essentials, well priced.For washing, I would recommend going to a launderette down the road (it's a 10 - 15  minute walk), on Soi 18, walk out the hotel, go on the main road and turn right, and continue walking for 10 -15 minutes, the launderette is called White Rabbit (costs about 40 baht for a wash/ 40 for a tumble dry etc).  Open at usual times of the day, and no queues when I went twice in the evenings.The food at Hilly's/ room service is so good.  I advise ordering the Thai dishes, they are so yummy and healthy.  I would avoid the western dishes (not many on the menu, but if you're in Thailand you may as well eat Thai food, you can eat your normal food when at home !).","The Quarter Ladprao by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

No microwave in the room likes the Quarter Ari, however the location is more convenient and easy to access to both MRT and BTS plus shopping centres nearby. Be aware of the room near the store room, it is noisy in the morning. The pool is decent size and the sitting area near the pool is spacious.

91,5.0,"Our stay has been nothing but pleasant at the Quarter Hotel. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and taken care of. They even give you welcome drink coupons that we later used at the restaurant. Deluxe room is definitely worth it. It is much bigger and nicer. We requested a quiet room on a high floor. That is exactly what we got. Our room was on the 12th floor facing a quiet alley. The view from the balcony was amazing at all hours of the day. Smart TV, comfortable bed, clean bathroom with the necessary toiletries, fridge, umbrella, safe, hangers and tea, coffee, water stocked daily, etc., everything we possibly needed was provided. The rooms are cleaned very well daily. The breakfast buffet is yummy with many choices. Every staff we met was super nice and always greeted us with a smile. The pool and the gym are very clean and nice. Poolside chairs and bean bags are perfect to lounge around on. During the evening they turn on the lights around the pool, and it looks so freaking romantic.Also bonus points, 7 eleven is right outside and MRT station is literally 1 minute walk. If you are taking the MRT get of at the Phahon yothin station! We got of at Lat phrao station and had to take a taxi to the hotel. Totally our fault.Only cons I want to mention is there was a bad smell coming from the toilet sometimes (maybe a piping problem), the bathroom and some of the furniture are showing some wear and tear.

I did a check-in process with bell boy(registor) and gsa ask me to take a seat and wait for the room. Then we wait for 15-20 mins which is fine for us cuz we know that we arrive early. Then we got the key, went to our room and while we were relaxing the housekeeper try to open the room door with only one knock and open it immediately but we use a double lock inside so she couldn't get in and realize that guests are in the room. We were shocked, my partner open the door and saw she walk away without any apologise. He called her and asked why did she try to open the door. She said she thought this is vacant room and she need to inspection it and say sorry. (I thought she inspected it since we wait at the lobby, So what did we waited for?) This is not our first time that the staff here try to open our room door. Last time we asked for late check-out with front desk but a housekeeper try to open our door at 12PM and asked for the check-out time. Why? and also about calling guest to check-out. The check-out time is at 12 PM. Why you guys have to call us at 11 and half? One last thing. I checked the price for upgrade my room by call and facebook chat the price are not the same.

Also on first day housekeeping didn't set up hand towels and have only body towels. Bed is comfortable however rooms are not soundproof. Our next door neighbors were watching TV late in the evening and in the morning. You can hear every word from TV in other room. How it is possible for 4 star hotel?Breakfast was more like a mess than experience. Choices are subpar. Variety of of food more remind me of 3 star hotel. Waffles station. You need to make waffles by yourself. Egg Station when I came was unattended. Only one good thing is coffee machine. It is nice but also not properly set up as latte need to be served in tall glass however near machine don't have any long glasses and then you press latte it will just give small shot of coffee.Location of hotel is fine. 7-11 is nearby.

In regards to all this we decided to write to the hotel two weeks before our journey to ask if we could change the date of our arrival we didn’t want a refund but simply a change of date however the hotel did not fulfil  our request as it did not think the pandemic was anything different and it said it operated as usual. We are extremely disappointed with the decision of the hotel as this is the only hotel that didn’t take our request on board and accepted our proposal but the other two we contacted we didn’t have a problem with rearranging the date. The hotel is clearly more interested in building profits rather than taking care of the customers. Please choose wisely before booking.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

They were very ""surprised"" to hear that I want to change the linen ""so late"". I waited 30 minutes for somebody to come and had to call them a few times. A guy came to change the linen. I left the room for a while. Later I found out that my international charger worth 40 euro disappeared... They are supposed to refund any loss up to 5000 Bahts. but they did not give me anything. They said that the cleaning staff say they did not take anything... Of course, what else should the staff say? I had to lock all belongings all the time when I was leaving room. Plus - I had very noisy neighbours, the TV was on all the time until 2 am. When I called to the reception the first night the female receptionist called to the room and they switched it off. The next night I had to call to the reception again at 11.30 pm as I could not sleep due to the noise. They said they would call them. Nothing was happening. I had to call to the reception again. They said they would send somebody to tell them. Nobody was coming. I went to the reception. There were 2 male receptionist. One of them pretended not to see me and did not greet me. The other one said the Thai ladies are watching a movie and want to finish it!! And if it disturbs me I can move to another room!! EVERYTHING is heard from one room to another. Plus - I was staying on the 27th floor and could hear cars and the skyline. Had to sleep with my earplugs all the time.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

The bathroom was huge, clean, and new. I gave extra point on the big mirror in the bathroom. I loved this place and I will totally come back. The breakfast was also great, various choices and located on the 22 second floor, breakfast with a view literally. Rooftop pool can beat all the five-star hotels in bangkok; you will get all the 180 view of bangkok and it was real relaxing.

63,4.0,"We chose this hotel as we arrived at night at Don Muang airport and departed from Suvarnabhumi the next night. For us it was important to have 24 hrs access/reception and closeness to the BTS.Our room was on 32nd floor and we had a nice view over Bangkok. As we were given an upgrade we had a kitchenette, a living room, a bed room and a balcony. The room was clean and there was a lot of storage space, most probably for business guest staying a little longer than us. We did not have the breakfast, but heard it was good. There was a pool on the roof, which had a nice size and a good view over Bangkok. I like the area of Ari as there are nice (hidden) bars, restaurants and coffee places and it's good to hang out for a day or two. I wouldn't want to stay at the hotel for a whole holiday but for one or two nights, especially when in transit, it's great. The hotel is located in the top floors of an office building and there are various cafés, a 24 hr 7Eleven and a Boots downstairs.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

It was around 30 mins from the airport by taxi. Good WiFi and pleasant breakfast also in a nice room with good views. Staff were always courteous and helpful. Malls and street food not too far away - with spas/restaurants. Some parts of Ari neighborhood are quite hipster with a nice vibe. The hotel is far enough away from the crowds but close enough to the city center.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
65,5.0,"The Quarter Ari is a gorgeous property and offers breathtaking views from both the rooms and rooftop swimming pool. My room was quite spacious; it even had a larger-than-expected mini fridge and microwave (perfect for leftovers and stocking up on ice cream from the 7-11 downstairs). I loved the whole modern look and feel, and it reminded me of a lot of hotels in New York City, but much bigger and for only a fraction of the price. Ari is a pretty fun area to explore with lots of cute cafes and restaurants. I really enjoyed the Tell a Story restaurant around the corner that had a local band playing and showed movies outside. I was only at the Quarter Ari for two nights, but would have loved to stay much longer. ","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

67,5.0,"I was recommended this hotel by a friend who visited Thailand the year before me and loved it. I stayed two nights at this hotel: my first and last nights in Thailand (three weeks apart). I couldn't have stayed at a better place to start and finish my trip. The staff is incredibly nice and the hotel facilities are great. The pool is on the smallish side but I haven't had the time to use as I was out and about exploring BKK. The views you get of the city are incredible and the location of the hotel is really good too - about 8-10 minutes walks from the Ari BST station meaning that it is very easy to get to the hotel from any of the two airports by public transport. I had a small issue with my booking where I was sent to the wrong room after check in, it didn't bother me at all but I then received a fruit platter as an apology. So sweet :)","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

Major positive features are the location (only ~8 min walk to Ari BTS station which gets you into downtown Bangkok quickly and easily, but also to Chatuchak Market in 2 stops) the modern quiet rooms, the swimming/fitness facilities, and quality breakfast. I would definitely be happy to stay here again.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

Only 6 minute metro ride to Mo Chit which is walking distance to Chatuchuk market (about 100 meters from Mo Chit stop).  The staff are super friendly and helpful, and the rooftop pool and the gym really nice. Rooms are spacious and large comfortable beds. Breakfast has many options and is nice. Would highly recommend this location as there are many things around and it’s close to the green line of the BTS.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
70,4.0,"The Quarter Hotel Ari is located on the 22-34th floors of an office tower in a residental/business area of Bangkok. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from Ari Skytrain station and 2 stops from the famous Chatuchak Weekend Markets.The Quarter Hotel has become very well known by Instantgrammers for the amazing views from the 34th floor swimming pool, particularly during sunset. The infinity pool is smallish and only has room for approximately 15 sun loungers so it can be a busy and not very relaxing experience. The Instantgrammers I encountered there were selfish and rude, not considering any other pool users in their quest for the perfect shot. It appeared to be a fashion photo shoot all the time, with swimsuit-clad women in full makeup and preened men strutting and flexing.I booked a deluxe room which was located on a corner and had expansive views across Bangkok. The bedroom was huge and the bathroom with full length windows gave a distraction while bathing. I particularly liked the kitchenette which had a three-quarter size fridge, microwave and crockery, cutlery and glasses. The amenities allowed me to purchase the amazing and famous Thai street food and enjoy it in the room if I desired.I only had a few interactions with staff and they seemed nice, though not overly friendly. I did encounter staff in the lifts and on my floor but sometimes there was no greeting which I find unusual for staff in a Thai hotel. Maybe a lil' more training and encouragement will give the staff the confidence to be more interactive.While the Quarter Hotel Ari is not a downtown hotel, the Ari area has everything you would need. Supermarkets, restaurants, spa treatments and so much more are at the doorstep of this hotel and I really enjoyed the local feel.If you're a poser, then The Quarter Hotel Ari is for you. If you're not, still stay in this hotel and go to the pool and SPLASH hard.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

75,1.0,"Our team are currently working on a long time project in Bangkok and have selected Quarter by Ari as a potential hotel to stay in. This was the second week I stayed at Quarter by Ari and again was hugely disappointed. 1) There were building works and constant drilling in the middle of the night from the moment I went into my room at approx 11pm at night.2) I called the hotel reception several times to fix the issue however there was no answer after several calls. 3) When they finally picked up they sent someone to the room who said they will fix the noise and tell the technicians to stop - this didn’t happen.4) Called reception again to complain yet the drilling continued for over an hour after past midnight. The hotel was doing building works in the middle of the night when this is clearly a time when guests are sleeping. This is shocking for any hotel and especially for a 4 star hotel which prides itself for being a business hotel. The hotel is new and in a good location in Ari, however I am hugely disappointed at the maintenance and service of the hotel. The rooms are not well cleaned and maintained. Towels are dirty and yellow. Other areas of improvement - the hotel should also consider extending their room service past 10pm which is very early. Overall, this hotel needs a lot of improvement to its service and maintenance if it wants to keep its 4 star status.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

78,4.0,"I was suggested this hotel by a friend who lived in the area and was told it was the best to stay at in the area and although I can't make a valid argument for or against that I was overall pleased with the hotel. Pros: this hotel was kept very clean and the staff I interacted with knew enough of my native language to properly communicate as I'm still a little new to the local language, I never got to the pool or the fitness center but the complimentary drinks were a nice touch and the green voucher incentive was nice to see as well, I saw in the lobby there was an attraction board for tourists who weren't sure what to do or go see. The staff was friendly and didn't hesitate to help me when I asked for it.Cons: There was a little confusion with my booking and I almost wasn't able to secure a ride from the airport to the hotel as provided, I did manage to get the ride but the driver seemed to be in a rush and was driving recklessly at least to my initial observation, I later learned that's just how people drive in Bangkok but it was not a pleasant experience.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

It was mostly asian and for western jetlagged people fried noodles in the morning is something we are not used to.Reception was okay, not extremely friendly, but kept reminding us what we have to pay.Mini bar had only complimentary water, nothing else.Room was spotless clean and big - we had an apartment overlooking the city and it was very nice.I would recommend it, but for what we've paid you can get a better hotel more central and probably will be cheaper!","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

91,3.0,"I have mixed review about this hotel really. Yes its rates are keenly priced. Its signature roof-top pool (and gym) is definitely the wow-factor that’s on par with some of the others top-rated hotels in Bangkok. But I think that’s where its attractiveness ends.   This might be a new hotel (which is why I chose), but other than the reception lobby, restaurant and pool which looks closely related to the management photos, the core function of a hotel – room standard and its services – are just extremely basic. The room décor is nothing fancy and yet it’s also of poor quality – it certainly feels more hostel than hotel and hence its competitive rate reflects. We booked a “premier suite” which is nothing too premier except it comes with a living room and on top floor with good view. The bathroom is not the cleanest as one should expect. The biggest problem however, is the total lack of sound proofing one should expect from a hotel stay. We could hear noises from upstairs (gym/bar) and next door throughout the night and traffic noises below even with windows shut.   The breakfast is just adequate and it can get a little chaotic when busload type of tourists arrive, the only good thing is the view you get.   Overall this is probably a hotel that fits perfectly for a budget traveller and who doesn’t expect too much but unfortunately it is not for us.

Breakfast was delightful and open from 6.30 to 10.30am. Outside there were plenty of shops. Brilliant value for money and very family friendly. Youngsters would adore the pool and choice of food and drink and adults would appreciate the hospitality, relatively low cost and other amenities, including easy access to the city’s amazing malls, temples and river cruises.

Management don’t care, we got complementary dinner as apology and when we went to have a dinner from a list of 50 foods only 10 available. For this amount of money definitely not worth to stay and we really don’t recommend. The hotel actually ruined our last days spent in Thailand.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
99,3.0,"Stayed for 2 nights.  Hotel on paper is fantastic but management is clearly not up to the job.  The whole hotel had no hot water for the complete day.  What made it frustrating was the complete lack of communication and lack of management staff on site to deal with such a major issue.  The manager Ms Tommy was nowhere to be seen after numerous requests.  Finally we were told she had gone to head office for a meeting leaving the poor front desk staff to deal with the problems!  There wasn't one manager available to make or take any decisions, we found this very strange.  A reputable hotel would have at least contacted each guest and even offered some kind of compensation even if it's a free drink.  The manager never did contact us before we checked out and I doubt she spoke to any of the other guests.  Very poor.  It's a shame as the hotel has good facilities, just let down by poor management.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

A modern and sophisticated hotel offering numerous outlets to wine and dine as well as 2 roof top bars.. wow!!I especially appreciate the amazing location next to Emporium Mall and just a small step to the sky train that can take me anywhere in Bangkok in only a matter of minutes.

Next night rooftop bar choice of 3 cocktails no Margaritas and not so special cocktails so nice glass of wine instead shame they had a different cocktail choice.The staff in every department were excellent and very friendly and efficient.

15,3.0,"The facilities and location of the Compass Skyview hotel in Bangkok are fantastic. The hotel is just minutes walk from the BTS, with links to the whole of the city. The hotel is equipped with a great rooftop pool, bars and restaurants, offering a wide range of cuisines.From our experience, the hotel sadly falls far short of its 5 star rating on the one thing that Thais are so famous for having in abundance: their hospitality.My wife and I recently stayed at the hotel on their very appealing “staycation” package that they are currently promoting to Thai nationals and residents, which is inclusive of all meals and use of standard amenities. However, we were left feeling disappointed and, on occasions, uncomfortable by the cold and impersonal front of house team, to the surly waiting staff at Mojjo Rooftop Lounge. The lounge is frequented by outside guests, as well as those staying in the hotel. From the service that we received, it actually appeared as though we were inferior customers at dinner because we were staying in the hotel.We were recommended this establishment by a member of our expat community, but we cannot do the same, based on this experience. Given the high competition in the area and the prestigious standings that this hotel holds, we were very disappointed with the level of service that we were accorded.",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

Loads of people raved about the breakfast, but I am not sure why. Hash browns were like tater tots that had been defrosted. Lunch time I tired a pizza that was served with a side of ketchup. I think after so many tries I just gave up on the food. If you stay here I recommend not eating here. Pool and gym were nice. A couple of the machines were out of order in the gym. They have a huge selection of cardio machines and free weights. My first day staying there I was gone almost the entire day and left the service light on in my room. Was surprised to return to my room after 8pm and find that housekeeping had done nothing. Customer service was nothing memorable. ",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

Upon arrival Sunday evening from the Airport we were greeted by a Lady on the front  reception that did'nt sound in great health continually coughing , which any other time was probably ok ? But in the current enviroment , I thought that it wasnt a great welcoming to the Hotel , that said Im sure the hotel checked her health and she was perfectly ok? After the first night my Wife reported to staff of unusual noises coming from the Aircon that were a bit noisy , they replied they will send someone to look at it , while we were out . On return we recieved a letter saying , Aircon maintanance will take place the following day 12-2pm !!! Conviently after we already checked out , so good luck to the next customer ? I thought a room change could have been offered , considering Occupancy of the hotel was very low , noting the amount of ppl at Breakfast etc .

Loved having cocktails at the rooftop bars (vanilla sky & Mojo), & loved the pool - I know some viewers have said its small, but we thought it was appropriate & sophisticated (very adult pool). We were offered an upgrade to a suite from a grand executive room, but preferred the grand executive room with the bath tub, which had great city views. Clean, comfortable rooms with amazing feeling sheets on the bed (best we’ve slept in). We’d stay here again.

23,5.0,"The Compass Skyview Hotel is located in the bustling and fashionable Sukhumvit area of Bangkok.  Specifically, it is conviently located at the Phrom Phong station of the BTS SkyTrain, just on the other side of the fashionable Emporium mall.   There are many restaurants and much shopping in the area.  There is a large upscale grocery on the 5th floor of the Emporium plus a 7-11 across the street from the hotel.The hotel is very modern and is kept in very super condition.  I stayed with my wife in a family connecting room with club lounge access.  This suite has a separate living area, two bedrooms(which can be closed off from each other), and two bathrooms (one with a shower enclosure and large bathtub and the other with a shower enclosure).  The living area, in addition to the tables, sofa and other furniture, has a clothes washer and dryer and a full sized refrigerator.Everyone in the hotel is super although I would like to call out Khun Aim, Khun Tik, Khun Mook, Khun Sherry, and Khun Sun for their friendly, helpful and professional services!I strongly recommend getting a room with club lounge access.  It includes morning breakfast with good choices and very good quality as well as complimentary cocktails and snacks between 6pm and 8pm.

27,1.0,"First let me say I’m a frequent visitor to the sky bar but it’s the first time I have stayed in this hotel.Checked in to the room and it was extremely hot.  Turned the aircon on and it wasn’t cooling the room off.  After about an hour of the aircon on full blast it was still sweltering hot and I was sweating like crazy.  I called the front desk and maintenance came up and worked on the aircon for about 30 minutes.  He determined he couldn’t fix it.  I spoke with the manager asking for nothing more than another room with working aircon, simple right.  This guy was unbelievable, he told me I could stay in the room for another 3 hours or leave and they will try and fix the aircon.  If that didn’t work they would look into another room.  Long story short, I got a refund and left the hotel.  This manager was so horrible and rude like I can’t even understand.  He should be ashamed of how he treats guests, and I told him so.  As an example of what great customer service is.  Upon leaving I booked the Landmark and while checking in I shared my story with their manager.  She could not believe my story.  Because of my experience she upgraded me to a way nicer room at no charge.  What a difference a hotel makes.  I will never go to the sky bar or stay in this hotel ever again.

29,4.0,"We booked the hotel much earlier and so the price was reasonable. The location was a plus point because it is just besides Emporium Shopping Mall and walking distance to EmQuartier and BTS. Therefore location is excellent.We stayed in Premier Room. Nice and spacious room. It was clean, thanks to iB(HK) who cleaned our room throughout the stay. However, a few points I wish to highlight to the hotel so that they can improve better. The aircon was a bit noisy and was louder when at night where surroundings is quiet. Toilet drainage seems to have problem. The glass panel at bathtub looks like a high risk possible accident. The side of glass is fixed to the wall, but the bottom of the glass panel is not. Hence, if someone accidentally hold the glass panel as support, it could break the glass panel and create danger. In additional, due to the gap, water can flow out to the toilet floor causing floor of the toilet very wet. This part, maybe you can take a look of how to improve it. Glue the bottom of the glass panel with silicon or something. I think there is a housekeeping room in our level and we could hear her talking or shouting loudly sometimes when we are sleeping inside the room. It is fine but if you are a light sleeper, this could be a noise to you and affect your sleep. Maybe the management can remind the staff to talk softly. The breakfast spread has western, chinese food, fruits etc. However, it did not change much during our stay. Hence, this is quite bored to us though. Haha. Other than that, all are fine. I think I will come back again to stay next time.",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

38,3.0,"We booked a club grand premier room in this hotel on the 28th floor. Checkin was fast and friendly, room equipped according our expectations, however, a little small considering it should be a „Grand“ room. After checkin we enjoyed the nice pool, then decided to go up to the Mojjo and Vanilla sky bar (separate review). When trying to go up we faced long waiting times with the escalator for the first time. This continued during our stay especially when there were private events on the upper floors.Several times we faced the situation that elevators were blocked by the staff bringing stuff from lower floors to upper floors and vice versa. Again not only long waiting times, but if elevator finally arrived it was simply not possible to go in. Also there is only one elevator for both, the parking lots which are on the lowest floors, and the bars on the highest floors. Consequently in the evening bar and parking guests are blocking each other.Our first breakfast we had in the Silver Lining executive lounge. Not only the choice was somehow very limited, but having only 1 other guest beside us the service did not clean our table nor could we order a second cup of coffee for more than 10 minutes: no staff available at all. So changed to normal breakfast room next day where choice and service was much better, however, asking ourselves why we booked premier room.Summary: average hotel, definitely not 5*.

We had the family connecting suit and its superb. 92 sqm with to bedrooms and bathrooms, open kitchen with a lounge. It got three TVs and three individual ACs. But the best was the clublevel access. What a bargain it was, when we discovered what was included. Amazing breakfast, all day softdrinks, end it said canapees and drinks 6-8pm. It was not canapees but an buffet and ala carte from the same kitchen as the Mojjo Restaurant. And free flow of longdrinks, wine, beer etc. We ate and drank for at leat 3000thb evey day and we also got an very good rate for the suite. The service etc was excellent, and the location is just superb. The best shoppingmalls and skytrain right outside. There is only one negativ thing and that was when we had new years dinner at the Mojjo in 32.floor and discovered that they charge 370thb for a bottle of water! I dont care if its imported from the northpole, its water...anyway, the room are restocked with plenty of local water every day for free so its not a disaster to pay 370thb as we did, but a little uneccesary I think.But altogheter this must be the best 5-star hotel we ever stayd in when comparing quality/price, and probably among top 5 hotels regardless of price.

55,4.0,"Have stayed at Compass Skyview Hotel by Compass Hospitality (SkyView Grand Premier Room) for 3 nights during end Nov 2019.LOCATION* Get off at BTS-Phrom Phong Exit 2.  There are two ways to Hotel : (a) there is a footbridge on the left hand side to Emporium (M/F), go to G/F, where there is an exit next to Starbucks (taxi station in front of Starbucks), the hotel is exactly next to this exit. (2) take the stairs (left hand side) down to the main road, turn into the inner street next to NaRaYa Bag store, it takes about 5 minutes to the hotel. However, the pavement is narrow, it might be inconvenient if carry big luggage.* There is a big 7-11 convenience store opposite to the hotel.* From BTS-Phrom Phong Exit 2, you could go directly to Emporium and EmQuartier (they are facing each other); both have food court and Gourmet Market. * Many local food stalls around the hotel.* Only one stop from BTS Asok, where the MRT Sukhumvit MRT is.   Hotel Service* My husband had contacted the hotel in advance, advised them that this is our wedding anniversary holiday.  Thank you for their warm hospitality, they have arranged a cake and sweet decoration in the room for us.* The swimming pool is not big and there are only about ten sundeck chairs, but the swimming pool is clean and the lady in charge is very nice. We really enjoy the swimming and the sunshine.* We just have tried the breakfast during our stay.  We are satisfied with the variety and taste of food, the most impressive point is they offer hot milk and great coffee (also offer coffee in the lobby during day time).* If I need to mention one shortcoming, the only thing that I hope the hotel could improve is ...... the toilet is spacious, but there is nowhere to hang the wet swimming suit (there is only a small hook outside the shower booth), which bothered us.

Only see the wall of the building which is very near from your room. I attached the picture I took..It should be notified before booking..If I had known that, I would 'not' choose this hotel definitely.I asked to change the room because of this terrible view, however the option was also not good-you can see dirty things on the top of building like old antenna.So finally I change the room with better view by paying additional charge..Terrible memories here...",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

65,5.0,"Compass Skyview is a new hotel I decided to try when visiting Bangkok with my family (3 adults and a 7 yo child). The hotel is modern with good apartment like facilities and located very conveniently. It is a 2 minute walk from Emporium Mall, and a 5 min walk to Phrom Phong BTS station (door to door). Upon check in, we realized the photos shown on hotels.com were inconsistent with the reality of a 2 bedroom-connecting unit. The staff were very efficient and took quick measures to fix this issue with a free upgrade to a unit with the correct facilities. This was impressive to say the least, and i would like to give special thanks to the female employee who took the initiative to get this done. I was not in time to get her name unfortunately, but she wore glasses, had short hair, and could speak Mandarin. Special appreciation goes out to Khun Green at the Concierge as well - he helped me with delivering a package to my customer through a courier service.

Adding some colour/rug/cushions and a few little touches of luxury/comfort could really take things up a notch, but this is not a criticism at all just an observation.

The toilet is nicely fitted out with a rain shower and lashings of hot water, but, how long would it take to scrub the mould from the tiles? Would it be so hard to adjust the feet on the fridge?

15,5.0,"This hotel is conveniently located about 10 minutes walk from the Sala Daeng BTS and Silom Road, or the hotel provides a shuttle service during the day. The reception staff were efficient and friendly. We booked a Premier One Bedroom which was extremely good value. The room has a kitchen with fridge, stove, micro wave, with plates abd utensils. If you need anything else for the kitchen just call Housekeeping. There was a sofa and coffee table and a good sized flat screen TV, as well as a desk and lamp.The bedroom has a comfortable bed, safe, and wardrobes. The bathroom is a good size with toiletries provided. Basically it is a serviced apartment. We didnt have a view, just the building nextdoor, but higher up you would, or at the front or rear of the building (we were on the side). We didn't have breakfast, but there was a promotion going which made it more than reasonable. There is a very good gym, and an ""L shaped"" pool that wraps around the rear of the building. The pool is deep compared to many Thai pools, and refreshingly cool. We had an issue getting the channels on the bedroom TV. We rang reception and someone came up and fixed it in 5 minutes. All requests to reception were handled promptly. Parking is available. Like a lot of Thai carparks the headroom appears low, however we have a huge 4wd car and managed to park without any problems. The rooms are spotlessly clean. If I were looking for something to criticise I would say that some of the furnishing is getting a bit worn, but not to the extent that it looked bad or I wouldn't want to stay there. I would say given the very reasonable price for the room (and there were several room types cheaper or dearer for that matter), the size of the room, 2 TV's, cleanliness, the kitchen, pool, and parking--that Siri Sathorn is a hotel I would happily stay in again.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

27,3.0,"I booked this hotel because I have been here twice to visit my friends who stayed here ; the room is very good although the air-conditional is loud.  However,  my personal experience with the staff has been more than dissatisfaction.  When I first requested two additional bottles of drinking water, I was told the usual practice is two bottles only.  I seriously cannot understand the big deal of giving two more bottles.  Would that cost the hotel a bomb?  Or is the hotel worried that every guest would demand for two additional bottles?  If there is a convenient shop nearby I would not have bothered to ask for additional drinking water, but there is no 7/11 or whatsoever nearby.  Later when I requested for late check out at 14:00pm on 25th October (tomorrow), I was told that the hotel is full on 25th October hence it is impossible to let me check out at 14;00, and I have to be out at 13:00.  I came back to the room and purposely check Agoda only to find out that roomS (not two or three, but at least five, unless Agodo is lying too) are still available tomorrow.  Lying would not get you anyway, and I believe your hotel needs to retrain your reception staff.  Especially when they see guest standing at the counter, while another colleague was attending to another guest over the phone, your staff ignored the one at the counter and continued to look for things in the steel cabinet.  Probably because I am an Asian, not a farang, hence I have been given such treatment.  A disappointment indeed.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

Manager was called, and she was very nice and all, she quickly solved the problem and we finally got to the room we booked originally at around  3 pm. But at the point, i was so hungry i almost faint, luckily, the manager called up to check if the room was ok and offer us free meal from kitchen, save me from hunger. Food was ok, nothing great, but suffice our hunger (as well as anger). Room was great, spacious, clean, hot water is hot, AC is cool, everything function properly. Bed was soft (my friend said too soft but i was so tired, i didn't care), pillows were nice. TV was working well. Safa smell a bit but acceptable. Internet is great. View is a lot better than room on opposite side of corridor. There was construction going on but not so loud, so we were fine. Our night went smoothly. BF was good, but slow on refill. They have small oven so i can reheat croissant, love that! Swimming pool and gym are great. Love the morning swim (only me in the pool) but the construction of building next door is a bit worrying. at one point, crane was lowing big piece of something and i was thinking, please don't drop it over my head. Parking was a bit of a hazard, or maybe i'm just not a good driver. Location is great with everything on walking distance (know this from map, i didn't have strength to explore on arrival).

The working desk came Andy to attend my morning calls with clients. Shower was very neat and clean. Overall it was a good stay,Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5
33,3.0,"Hotel itself is fine. Not new, but clean and comfortable. There was a little kitchen in the room. Nice restaurant. Good location. Pool (but I was surprised that the water was cold), gym. Not luxury but functional enough. There were 2 problems. First and the main one - construction nearby. They start to work early in the morning (including weekend) and end late in the evening. Second - curtains are not blackout.  After sunrise the were a lot of light in the room.

For those fitness minded there is an excellent gym and those wanting to cool off there is a small outside pool.

I liked everything, but there are so many rats on the way from from BTS to the hotel.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5
42,2.0,"We picked this hotel due to its relative proximity to the embassy, and its overall rating. It was WAY more expensive than many other of our choices, but seemed worth while. The staff was very friendly, the food at the restaurant was really good. Unfortunately, the room was DISGUSTING. Every time I entered the room, my allergies flared up and I spent several miserable nights trying to sleep. Additionally, 75% of the horizontal surfaces covered in fabric contained ""stains"" of the biological variety. It made it very difficult to relax in bed, or on the sofas, or window seats. We attempted to contact management about our concerns during our stay, and were never contacted. My husband, my daughter and I could've chosen much better for much less. I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5
43,5.0,"Good location not too far from major metro/light rail transport but amazingly quiet for its position in the heart of the craziness that is Bangkok! Our room was enormous and had a kitchenette although we didn't really use it a lot as there are loads of nearby eating options - though the fridge was certainly very useful. The ensuite shower/bathroom was nicely appointed and always plenty of hot water. Only had breakfast on our first morning - it was very good with a huge choice, just didn't feel we needed a big breakfast with all the food options Bangkok has on offer. The staff are all lovely and the doorman in his traditional costume was unfailingly jolly, and the room was kept very clean with fresh towels every day. Good aircon (essential), not too noisy  though not as quiet as the very most modern. There is also a coin operated laundry for guests which was really useful as we had been travelling for several weeks. I would stay there again.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

45,1.0,"About the check in ... I arrived at Siri Sathorn, early in morning, totally exhausted after a long international flight. I was happily  surprised to discover that my room (a junior suite) was available and ready. I paid and ... things changed immediatly. The lady at the counter, without mentioning that before, told me that I cannot get the room until 12pm unless I pay an additional amount ! What kind of policy is it if not racket ? I can easily understand to wait until 12pm or even 2pm when rooms are not available but it wasn't the case. Forgot to mention that I, and my wife too, used to stay for long periods at Siri Sathorn. No need to say that it is the last time.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5
46,4.0,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our Thailand trip. The location suited us as a family with two kids - it's reasonably quiet as it seems to be surrounded by other hotels, serviced apartments and office blocks with the bonus of being able to walk to both the BTS (Sala Daeng) and MRT (Silom), which meant we didn't need taxis to get to where we want.  The hotel provides a free shuttle every 30 mins (do check when they begin and end though) to either of these places if you don't feel like the 10 minute walk. On the walk to the BTS station there is an outdoor food centre which has all sorts of interesting stalls, try get here before or after the lunchtime rush where lots of office workers come and eat.  Next to the BTS station is Silom Centre which has a TOPS supermarket under ground level if you want to stock up on breakfast supplies etc.  We booked the 2 bedroom deluxe suite, which was very spacious and clean. The complimentary fruit platter at arrival was much appreciated. It is a bit dated but we didn't mind. The most important thing was that it was quiet and the blinds did actually block out the light so we all slept well. Showers are a bit ""temperamental"". You can't adjust them after the water has started running or else it runs very hot, or very cold.  We found that it was best if you turn the tap on in the middle, let it run for a few minutes, and if you need to adjust, do that, and leave it on for a few more minutes so it has ""time "" to adjust? Some staff are fantastic (special mention to Kart who was always very cheery and another gentleman who opened doors for us but sadly I forgot to note his name), some aren't great (one lady hung up on me when i called).The pool was very nice as was the gym. Much needed as it does get very hot. Given the price, the location and the spaciousness of the room, we'd stay there again if we come back to Bangkok.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

48,2.0,"A full length mirror should be nearby the bedroom and not literally in front of the front door where we steps in and out with our dirty shoes. It's pretty difficult for us to keep standing in front of the closed toilet door for grooming. The hot water/cold water adjustment in the bathroom is crazy. I Adjusted abit to the hot side and I becomes way too hot, adjust a bit to the cold side and it becomes way too cold and when it's perfect, even when you don't touch it, it turns it's temperature to be too hot. I obviously didn't enjoy showering there. Fix it! I stayed there for 3 weeks, I pahid alot of money as well as in Jan 2019 and August 2019 too. So I know how this hotel works really well! In room dining caller, female staff, working in the well established hotel industry but unable to speak English! I spoke to her in English and she conveniently replied to me in Thai!

The staff were friendly and courteous. My room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. On the 15th, I checked out in the morning, left the luggage at the reception and went for sightseeing. It was a very hot day in Bangkok and I was exhausted when I returned to collect my luggage. In preparation for my 9 hour night time flight back to Australia, I asked the girls at the reception if I could freshen up a bit. Then they said I could have a shower in their shower room in the gym - a service I wasn't expecting after checking out.The guy looking after the gym kindly offered me a fresh bath towel and the shower room was perfect. Oh! what a relief at the end of an exhausting day. It was the perfect way to say good buy to a weary customer.

What it needs though is some redecoration soon, new colors and materials and just an update. The price is not bad but for bkk the market is so huge and choices unlimited with hotels, so this property needs to stay in touch!Pool is great yet sunbeds at 4 pieces are way too little on a crowded day. The gym is nice and well maintained by the staff. Sauna is a big plus. Pricing of hotel restaurant and bar is great! Not overcharging for every little item is appreciated. I would consider this property for my next stay 2 months away",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

It was set out as if you  could live there for a year!

We obtained a free upgrade to a better room.  We are only to check in at 2pm. Gym looks the same. Room looks the same, but pillow is too high for my liking. Air-con is cold but shower hot water temperature is hard to control. Breakfast was not included, so we bought micro-waveable food from 7-11 as breakfast. Room is clean n comforty n spacious. It is some 12mins slow walk from Saladaeng BTS.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5
71,3.0,"This is my third stay here which might suggest I have no complaints. Certainly, the location is great (I usually stay in Sathorn/Silom); rooms are spacious if dated; there’s an ok outdoor pool and a very decent gym/fitness centre. But even though it is good value, there’s something missing, at least compared to other hotels with a similar price point and location (Eg: Bandarra Suites, literally across the road).So what’s lacking? First, I’m ok with rooms that are a bit dated (I loved the Dusit Thani, sadly now in the process of being demolished). But SS seems to have a bit of a mould problem; in some rooms there’s no  power point anywhere near the bed to plug in your phone charger etc; and the toilet paper consists of annoying single squares -surely we’re adult enough to have a proper roll of toilet paper. I also don’t get that when you book a room through an aggregator such as Agoda, and specify ‘non smoking’ you get an email from the hotel saying they can’t guarantee a non smoking room. When you press them in reply they confirm a non smoking room, but why have to go through all this to get there? Staff are generally friendly, some are terrific ( doormen, porters restaurant staff, maids ) but others seem a bit jaded indifferent, just going through the motions. But what has irked me most after three stays, and will mean I will think twice about staying again, is a rigidity or policies and rules that don’t make much sense. Ok, I wasn’t allowed to keep in my room the corkscrew I’d asked for; ok I wasn’t allowed to take my included breakfast coffee up to my room but was told if I did that I’d have to pay for it -as if it was room service even though I wasn’t asking anyone to bring it to my room. But the final straw was when I did order a glass of red wine to my room, and realised it was ‘corked’ and undrinkable. I asked for a replacement from a fresh bottle but was told that wasn’t possible. Instead, the room service guy came back to collect the glass of wine and show me a piece of paper that confirmed my order had been canceled. Surely it would have been easier to just ‘accept the customer was right’ and send up a fresh glass?The overriding attitude seems to be ‘can not’ rather than ‘can’. So, now I’m across the road at Bandarra Suites and, two nights in, no complaints. I have a business suite which is ridiculously spacious and has sweeping views over Lumphini Park. There are two pools, friendly staff, a good gym, a coin op laundry. My room rate doesn’t include breakfast but I can get it day by day for a very reasonable  299 baht (about A$14).So, next time I’m in town and looking for great value for money accommodation, I think I’ll be pulling out my iPhone and say ‘Siri, take me to Bandarra Suites’.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

73,3.0,While we think the taste for food here is slightly above average we found its presentation is stunning and food is refreshing as a masterpiece of Thai traditional food difficult to be found anywhere in Thailand. The ingredient used for their food presented in a series of set has been simply impressive and rewarding. Starting with the signature dish for each past King Rama I to Rama VI you will be educated and impressed for these wonderful Thai cuisine. Simply come for presentation is really worth your effort. ,Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

I will mention this we stayed on 6th fl. Always a musty smell getting off elevator, the master RR toilet seat broken so that every time you sat on it it felt tilted.

The hotel is luxurious, the breakfast buffet is just like a dream for a foodie – so many things to try, plenty of fresh exotic fruits, delicious local dishes and the good old European options... The pool is a bit cold, but the gym is v very nice! The staff is polite and extremely helpful. The transfer to the airport is a bit pricy, but that’s not exactly related to the hotel. Our wonderful apartment consisted of two rooms, and it was so comfortable, at first we didn’t want to go out at all)) Though we did in the end, because the hotel has a perfect location for exploring Bangkok - walkable distance to all the best malls like The Platinum Fashion Mall. The tube station is also just two steps from the hotel. And the street it is located on has plenty of cosy little local places to eat, as well as a Seven Eleven. We would love to stay here again if we come back to Bangkok!","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
62,5.0,"Hey Evergreen staff Just want to say thank you for a very nice stay. I have never gotten so good service before. Your crew is professional but are still able to laugh with the customers. Last night I went down to order a taxi to driver me to the DMK airport for today. I was standing there for maybe 1 hour or so just talking to Sein and Next. We laughed and laughed and had a very great time. I think this is the best you can give a customer. Next has only been working for you for 2 or 3 months but she is really competent and has a unique way to make a guest feel welcome. You should cherish her because she will grow and only become better. She's one of a kind. Sein help me to check in when I came 5am in the morning. He had a big smile and is very friendly and he really tried of I could check in so I didn't had to wait until 2pm. He did everything he could, and kept saying sorry even though is was not his fault but mine that I came so early. He is a very humble guy who is a manager and has only been with you since August 2019. He is a keeper! Thank you so much!

The bathroom seemed to be newly renovated and was nice.

64,4.0,"Chose this hotel as it’s a 5 min walk from our son’s condo and as we were staying 14 nights it proved to be easy walking distance from BTS, Siam and Platinum district (from where we usually stay).  However, we booked a superior room which was adequate for a few nights but no where to store clothes ie no wardrobe space if you are staying longer.  Bathroom was a good size but towels were well worn and although clean need replacing soon room had a nice large bed and excellent bed linen and very comfortable with efficient a/c. Lacking a well placed sockets in fact the only one we could use was under to shelf so had to take the kettle into the bathroom (only twice did housekeeping replenish 2 tea bags).Room was clean but in sadly need of refurbishment and balcony needs a deep clean, pool area proved to be quiet during our visit but probably a few more sun beds would be useful at busy times the pool and gym staff were friendly and welcoming.With the exception of the two porters and the duty manager the female staff need coaching in customer service, they were rude and extremely unhelpful particularly when we checked out.  Where is the famous Thai smile it certainly wasn’t at the Evergreen last 2 weeks.Although we had a couple of issues we would return as its such a convenient  location but but upgrade to a deluxe room or above in future.  We didn’t eat in the hotel as it just didn’t appeal and considering we stayed for 14 nights the staff with the couple of exceptions already mentioned were quite off hand.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

Moreover, we did not see any of the long-serving staff anymore.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

We returned after 2 hours and found a clean and comfortable room, dated and chipped but with a bathtub and an opening window.

68,2.0,"We booked for the family room with a balcony.  The room was pretty big and had two bathrooms and a kitchen which was nice. The balcony, which was our main reason for booking, was impossible to sit in. They put no less then 5 condensers in it, so it’s hot chocking air on you face and always very noisy. The staff response for that was that “It’s a common thing in every hotel”. WTF? No costumer service awareness.Breakfast is somewhat between average to poor, pool is poor, looks much better in photos.

73,4.0,"The Evergreen Place Siam in Bangkok was a neat and tidy hotel with friendly staff. The room was quite big and had a small fridge, microwave, kettle, and cook top, the decor was a little dated but it was fine. Location: The MBK Centre was a 10 min walk away, and the hotel is very close to the Ratchathewi Station, about 1 min walk. There is an awesome dining precinct right across the road called Coco Walk with several great, affordable Thai restaurants and bars. I recommend one in there called Thai Town, the food was excellent and drinks were strong. As it's a big main road, it's best to go to the Ratchathewi station, go up the big stairs, across, and down the stairs on the other side, in order to cross the road. There is a Massage place next to the hotel driveway which does Thai massages but we didn't think they were very good, our backs actually felt more sore afterwards, I wouldn't recommend that one.Facilities: The hotel has an outdoor pool on the 8th floor with sun lounges, its not a big pool but it's fine. The gym was good, it looks small but it actually has a lower level and rooms behind it with a boxing studio, and toilets with lockers and showers. The gym has free weights, lots of machines with cable weights, treadmills and fit-balls, and provides towels and water.Breakfast: The breakfast buffet was good, it had a mix of western and asian foods and lots of healthy options as well, and an omelette station. Shopping: Definitely check out the MBK Centre which has a bit of everything and has lots of food places to eat at, and good public toilets. There's alot of bargains, some will do bartering, souvenirs, and fashion for men, women, and kids as well. Another good Mall for fashion is Platinum Fashion Mall, it has a huge amount of awesome unique designs for women, kids and men, but mostly women are the main ones here, less bartering and more fixed prices, higher prices but better quality. Transport: A taxi to the airport is around 250-300 baht, and a Tuktuk to Platinum Fashion Mall is around 100 baht. Enjoy!! ","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

Only concern is the sofa by side of the window, the surface may need some retouch, suggest to make it wider while the renovation, then it can be a great day bed in the room. == Facility ==Great thing is the fitness open 24hours, good for me to do the cardio in the early morning.

Walking distance to Central World and Siam Paragon. My friend and I stayed at Deluxe room with club benefits from Marriott’s. Unfortunately club lounge on a high floor was temporarily closed for renovations so we spent time at ground floor bar instead. Luckily we still had some snacks to enjoy. The bed size is perfect and soft. The wild clear window can see througc bathroom is good for staying alone and couples lol. But the room was a little bit old for the electric stuffs, no USB and still need to use ight switch. Staffs are friendly and helpful but there were a traffic during snacks time at ground floor.

Khun One is highly professional, she manages the club lounge effectively with friendly vibes, making guests feel very much like home. Breakfast is one of the best in town. Loved the signature egg benedict with curry sauce. Must try! The afternoon tea and canapes times (rather think of it as late lunch and dinner), were always of high quality and tasty and it includes alcohol too!

Very convenient. Room: The decoration is nice, particularly the glasses which neatly used. The bed is amazing is very pleasant. The desk is also nice. The television is good. There are many channels. The toilet is beautiful. There is also a bidet shower next to the toilet. The bathtub is big and beautiful. It’s really photogenic. The amenities are good, nice smell. I really like the body lotion. There is an iron in the room as well. Well-equipped. Comfortable.Food: Delicious. Wide range of choices. Good quality.Service: Bell boy, and front desk boy are good. Housemaid are friendly. They gave me a very good impression. Very polite.Lounge: I went to check in on 21st floor at club lounge with a female staff. She did not greet me as a Marriott member. From my experience, when I check in any Marriott hotel, they generally greeted me by welcoming me back again. So, when she did not greet me like that, I was surprise; but that is fine, maybe she forgot. When I informed her about my booking, she looked nervous. From my experience, she did not perform a professional gesture at the check in desk. I did not tell me which room I was about to stay. When she finished the check in procedure, she did not inform me as well. So actually, from my experience, I expected more. I think this check in experience was not professional and unimpressive, particularly when compare to another Marriott hotel which I have stayed.At the lounge, on the day that I visited, there was a lot of people. I waited for quite a long time to get food. So I did not go back on the next day, because eating somewhere else was more convenient.Overall: Everything good, except the lounge.

16,5.0,"The only hotel I been to that has a heated pool in Bangkok. Why would you need a heated pool in tropical Bangkok one wonders? The fact is there are indeed short sporadic periods of cold spells from November to January. This period, it went as low as 15 Celsius in my car’s thermometer on some mornings. For tropical folks here, jumping into a swimming pool in the cool season will throw many into hypothermia. So, when the pool is heated to a balmy 29 Celsius (as seen on my Garmin), it was indeed pleasant. As I swam over the water circulation outlets, it was like encountering those heated volcanic vents in the deep cold sea. The pool here is open air, but indoors in the shades. Lately, there has been a wave of Covid in Bangkok, strict measures are back in place again. To get access to the pool, we had to make advance bookings. Each booking is limited to 30 minutes. During that half hour, we had the whole pool to ourselves. Although this sounded restrictive, which it is, the experience was exquisite. Especially when you have children that are like 60,000W loudspeakers generating white noise, you do not really have to be concern about it as there are no one else around that could feel irritated. I loved the pool. It was like our personal family bathtub, minus the soap and bubbles of course.  The room we had was a one-bedroom studio suite. There are 4 on the corners of the floor we were on. Our room has generous windows across 270 degrees and that extended into the bathroom where a standing tub stood. A sturdy wall desk next to the large flatscreen, it was space slightly tight for some work I had to do. Natural light irradiated throughout the room, and the view of the urban scape was splendid. As the skies dusk, the spectrum of sunset tones painted our room. A sofa along one side, that was where I lazed relaxed and sipped coffee while watching the afternoon skies. Right beside this corner, a traditional set of gongs erected vertically on a stand. That was where I made loud chimes that did no rhymes, and probably irritating the rooms adjacent. The sound insulation between our room and the next 1726 was rather disappointing. No staff policed the floors on this Saturday night. The next room sounded like they had 20 people compacted in there to make the best out of the weekend room thay paid for. They were yakking loud, there was high pitch witchy laughter and there was constant slamming of the door as people went in and out of the party room. That really devastated my sleep. Fortunately, my child was able to sleep through all these. I only managed to get some shut eye after 1 am.  The executive lounge is located on a high floor. During cocktail hours, the place was entirely filled. This season, everywhere in Bangkok, everyone is a privilege guest with lounge access. And so, this is where we all turned cocktail canapes hour into a dinner meal. I love the way Renaissance practiced Covid measures here. We were not allowed to self-serve at the buffet line. But with the house being full, we had to wait long for our orders to be taken and waited equally long for the staffs to bring our food from the line. Children were at the verge of throwing tantrums. There was salad, there was karaage chicken for the children. There was the delicious panang pork curry and traditional rice crackers with meat sauce topping (except they kept forgetting to bring me the meat sauce). And then there was more. We really did not need dinner after that. Breakfast was an enjoyable feast as well. Except they were trying to freeze us to death. My congee turned into ice block, my pancakes turned into flying saucers. My child was unusually quite due to low body temperature and returned to live when I gave her hot food. Just kidding…  but it was cold. Breakfast spread featured local morning delicacies you find in markets. Moo ping (BBQ pork on sticks) was excellently tender and tasty. It was accompanied by sticky rice. There was kai yang kao niao (BBQ chicken, again with sticky rice), and there was also the traditional soy milk with dough fritters. It was local through and though. Some like it this way, bring the market in clean without walking the alleyways. Other then local, there was sushi, really delicious dim sum and all the other western spreads. They even had pulled-pork sandwich. I have always been impressed by the wide range in a Marriott buffet, but here at Renaissance, it was equally impressive. It did get quite crowded as 9 am drew near, so be early or be queued on weekends. We ate and ate, we did not need to have lunch, for the next 3 days.    Renaissance is located away from the main road. Seven Eleven will be a short stroll under the walkway of a shopping complex that has got a good sports factory outlet. On the main road up the stairs to the elevated walkway, you can easily reach Central World, the BTS and everything else. Convenience and access to everything are just short walks away. Outdoor areas for chilling out is limited in this hotel. Down the lobby, there are some chairs by the driveway, but that is the smoking area. The other outdoor space one could spend some time lazed on a chair to read a book is where the swimming pool is. And then there is the roof top bar, which is for drinks in the night, and was closed because of Covid. Any conducive space to do some notebook related work? No, there is none if outdoor one seeks. So, our room will have to be the work room, but with noisy child my concentration collapsed. There is a meeting room where the executive lounge is, but I would prefer sitting outdoors on a cool morning. All in all, my stay was fulfilling and fantastic, except for the noisy night. What was most unique and what I loved most, the heated pool. This shall be my return destination in the cooler months of Bangkok. And there are still some last chances of cold spells in Jan 2021 for the personal bathtub experience.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

19,5.0,"Staying at the Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel for 5 consecutive nights, we had so many great experiences there. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Bangkok. There are plenty of shopping malls nearby such as the Central World; where my wife went for her figure skate practice almost everyday and the Gaysorn Village is less than 5-min walk. And, the hotel is connected to the BTS Chitlom station via the Maneeya building on the 3rd floor. There are not so many guests during our stay so the hotel's quite peaceful and private. The 25 meter city-view indoor pool is a must to try. The fitness center is fully equipped with treadmills machines, and free weights, very impressive. We would recommend the La Tavola italian restaurant for dinner, the Parma ham pizza and their signature Tiramisu are mouth watering. Also, the famous Feiya chinese restaurant is always the best in Bangkok. Please try Peking duck and Dim Sum for lunch. Furthermore, we loved the wagyu beef burger atthe R Bar, so very yummy. We got upgraded to the Renaissance Suite room which is huge, beautifully decorated, and the bed and pillows are very comfy. We enjoyed the large sized bathroom, bathub with million dollar view. All the staff gave us a very warm welcome and best service since check-in; from Bellperson to Front desk. Moreover, we'd like to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to Khun Cyndy, Khun Tuk, and Khun David for their kind assistance reserving and upgrading the room, and making sure that everything's alright for us during our 5-night stays at the hotel, especially the lovely yummy cake for us, we appreciate your thoughtfulness.

We didn’t went for the club room in the first place but then we decided to go for the Happy Hour (just a little additional price) and I have to say it was beyond our expectation. The food was even better than some other hotel’s lounge in a normal situation but the drinks may be so-so, but hey for this kind of price and situation it’s the best.

28,5.0,"Located at the heart of Bangkok’s shopping and dining district and a short hop to the city's largest green space, Lumpini Park, Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel ticks all the boxes for a downtown hotel. Furthermore, with special promotions now being offered, there's no better time to spend a few days living in the lap of luxury.Renowned for its delectable cuisine, outstanding spa and vibrantly artistic decor, Renaissance Bangkok offers guests a choice of 11 different room and suite accommodations. From the plush Executive Suite to the standard Deluxe room, each is filled with world class amenities, stunning decor and outstanding furniture; the beds are super comfortable too.The lower floors of the hotel are primarily reserved for food, function and fun areas. R Bar, for example, is a wonderful place to hang out enjoying your favourite cocktail, an ice cold beer or a straight up Americano coffee. The lobby is an artist's dream with hidden motifs, flowery symbols and a grand glass stairway. Hidden behind doors is the car lift, which rumour has it can be reserved for private dinners!Also located here are fine dining restaurants La Tavola, Fei Ya and Flavors, which shares the floor with the amazingly high-tech ballroom. La Tavola is one of the city's top Italian restaurants, while Fei Ya without a doubt cooks up the best Cantonese food, including its amazing Peking Duck, outside Hong Kong. Flavors, on the other hand, serves a fabulous international breakfast and at weekends is home to probably the best Sunday Brunch.The upper floors are where guests can indulge in a little R & R, with Quan Spa providing a unique array of treatments, the welcoming lap pool and sun loungers (in fact the pool is indoors so no chance of sunburn), while the exclusive Club Lounge is an oasis of calm.With easy access to Bangkok’s skytrain system, guests can enjoy shopping, cultural or sightseeing tours across the entire city. The skytrain interconnects with the city's subway system as well as riverboat services along the Chao Phraya River. However, if you prefer to stay closer to the hotel, guests have half a dozen shopping malls within a one-kilometer radius.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
29,5.0,"Last stay was my 3rd times here and there are still many more bookings to come as here is one of my most favorite hotels in Central Bangkok. Why?Lobby: Nice and welcoming atmosphere with fresh and beautiful scent. Room: A bit old but comfortable and well-equipped with necessary amenitiesFood: No bad-taste food or not fresh food to think of Club Lounge: Good View with privacy atmosphereEverything seems to be right here for our family, but the most impressive thing to us is the STAFF from Front Door, Concierge, Club Lounge, Restaurant, Housekeeping, Pool & Fitness etc. Everyone we met are very energetic with, from my feeling, genuine service-mind. They are well-trained, nice, cheerful and helpful.Although I cannot name everyone here, but there must be some staff who I would like to give special thanks and let them know that they are recognized by their service mind skills. Khun Kevin (Concierge Navigator): He always has a big smile on his face with his good memory about the hotel's return guests, especially what they like or don't like. This definitely makes us feel like coming back to our 2nd home to meet friends. He also has a remarkable ability to make us so tasty cocktails that we forgot to count how many drinks we have had. Chef Jack: I am sure he is one of the key persons who makes the hotel’s restaurants well-known for their tasty fine-dining and services. He is outstanding from the cloud in terms of making you become a special guest by offering special things through his culinary expertise. Front and Club Lounge staff: Khun Dew, Khun Nan, Khun David, Khun Tiffy, Khun Kwan, Khun Aeh, Khun Yo as well as Khun Cindy (RSVN) – you are all a legend of our hotel experiences.

30,5.0,"The Renaissance Hotel is in the center of Bangkok's shopping area, called Ratchaprasong.  The hotel is new, clean and has a refreshing look.  It is also close to BTS skytrain which passes by in front of the hotel.  We visited October 13-15 and as Titanium Elite was upgraded to a club suite.  When entering the lobby, you are greeted by a huge area, gift shop, bar and restaurant in addition to the front desk and comfortable sitting area with plants, flowers and water fountain.   Mention you are a club member and they will escort you to the club floor for check in.  If not, the front desk is staffed by friendly, cordial team members.  All the hotel staff we came in contact with from front desk, club lounge, security, housekeeping, etc. were helpful and attentive.  Our room was spacious with king bed, desk, sofa, easy chairs and a huge bathroom with walk in shower and all the amenities.  Bedding was immaculate and fresh.  The club lounge offered breakfast, tea time and cocktail and snacks, which were more than ample.  Staff were great.  Also in the hotel is an Italian Restaurant, (closed Mondays) and a Chinese restaurant, in addition to all day buffet style dining.  The fitness area offers a swimming pool which is open till late, as well as the gym also open till late.  No bakery on site.  Although Elite members get discounts on dining, during the special promotions with daily credits, they do not discount any further than the amount they are offering, so if 500 baht daily credit, you can use that at your discretion but they will not add on another 20-30 % discount.  Logical.  All the areas of the hotel we visited, were spotless.  It is wheelchair accessible with elevators and level areas throughout.  If visiting Bangkok, I highly recommend the Renaissance  Hotel.  ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

I thinkfine, everything sucks but we have our suite room to go! so we open up our room and we are shocked, It’s executive room which have the same size as normal.we no longer want to make complain or anything, It’s really a bad day, my kids want to swim so we go off swimming, the pool is great, probably the best thing in this hotel.and the we comeback and turn the aircon off as It’s cold for kids(which turn out to be a terrible action). after we are done we turn zircon on, put on our cloth and decided to go to sleep(around 10pm) but the problem is the aircon doesn’t even works, It’s very hot at the 20 degree, we can barely breath.we then called front desk to send mechanic up to fix it, he said everything is normal, normal? really?I asked him that can he swear that this is 20 degree, can he breath(I even left my sandle to hold the door open so I can let some air in) he speak sarcastically “do you want it to be colder, just say it” and ofcouse I want it to be colder, after an hour everything is fix(11pm) and we go to sleepfront desk call us at 11:30pm probably to ask if everything is fix yet but It’s 11:30pm and my children are sleeping so I hang up and took off the phone.in the morning we found letter saying that they are sorry for the air-con problem, no need to say sorry if you don’t mean it, I tear it up and throw away it trash.breakfast was fine but we made an order for some thai food but they forgot to make it and we have to keep asking for it.when we check out, me and my wife ask front desk to cancel all of our reservation, so this is our 1 night stay, if you are going to stay here, I wish you luck, may the force be with you",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

33,5.0,"I've been doing a several months of Work From Hotel, and this has my favorite place in Bangkok. The hotel has one of the best location with easy access to BTS Chidlom, and short walk from Siam / Ratchadamri. Easy access to thousands of restaurant options. The front desk, housekeeper, and bell staffs were very nice. As a titanium member, they tried their best to upgrade me to the studio suite. The room offers great layout, fresh and very well decorated. I’d say the room is on par with Intercontinental, and significantly better than the dated Hyatt Erawan / JW Marriott. The executive lounge offered an okay food and drinks selection, but could get a bit crowded over the weekend.One downside would be the small pool area, no poolside services, and lacking hot bath or jacuzzi (neither in the spa). In hotel dining is also a bit limited, with Fei Ya’s pecking duck being the only standout option.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for a stay in Bangkok.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Again love the idea of ordering you egg/waffle/pancake options and instead of waiting for completion the Chef or runner brings it to your table.. A special shout out to Reena.(does she ever go home? Always pleasant and accomodating). She recommended a delicious restaurant NARA just steps from the hotel. Had we not had her expert guidance we would have missed this gem. I was fortunate to meet the Food and Beverage Director also. He was busy perusing the Breakfast flow and communicating with the Chef. So Mr.Winfried Sanders kudos for your guidance and intuitive outreach. (He actually went to every seated table and personally greeted each guest. Asked if there were anything else they would need. This to me being in the hospitality service industry myself would fit the bill of what Danny Meyer calls. ""Enlightened Hospitality""). I inquired if I could possibly take a Coffee American to go. And in 1 minute the coffee was delivered to my table. I look for every nuance of poor service when I travel. There was nothing I could find at this property with regards to that matter.

It just took us less than half an hour from airport to hotel, amazing.The moment we entered the hotel, we felt the hospitality. The check in was fast & we were served with a cold welcome drink.

We had daily breakfast and I love the fresh fruit juice counter, but having to stay for 4 days straight, we got a little bored with the food option, so maybe the chef can have alternate day change of food menu?

Khathy and Little (their nicknames) clearly explained that the Executive Lounge is under renovation and indicated where its services where being provided instead. My room was perfect as always with a very inviting bed and ample bathroom space. Super clean!After hitting the fitness room, headed to the Tavola where they would be serving evening canapés and drinks. Was helped in by Dew who is an outstanding hostess and indicated the temporary arrangements. The Tavola is the Italian restaurant which is also serving as Executive Lounge. Helping guests are the same staff as in the regular lounge making it an almost seamless transition. I have to recognize the gracious help provided in the lounge by Dew and Min, who have a great attitude doing their jobs. Min was fantastic about recommending canapés and providing my favorite drinks.

57,5.0,"We visited for one night during our time in Bangkok to celebrate our anniversary. After some digging online, I was able to find an email address to send a request prior to arrival. My email was swiftly responded to by Miss Jidapha, an R Ambassador, and I felt assured that we would be well taken care of. I was particularly impressed with Aggie at the concierge desk. We had sent another email prior to arrival with a request for recommendations of a nice restaurant for our anniversary dinner. He made our reservation and when we went to the valet stand to request a cab, Aggie asked where we were going and immediately recognized us by our booking and greeted us by name. We saw him again the next morning and he asked how our dinner was. This was a great show of customer service and guest recognition, thank you Aggie! Based on the level of service we received from staff across the board, I was disappointed when I made some housekeeping requests via the Bonvoy app (there was a button that appeared after check in to make requests). Unfortunately we never received the items that I had requested until we made a call to the front desk. I had no problem calling the desk, however if you offer a service to make requests through the app it should be more closely monitored. Also, the chat function did not work either. Minor inconveniences, but worth a mention to look into! *i should  note our requests prior to arrival were completed in advance, these were made after check in*We reserved a club level studio suite, and while the Club Lounge was closed for renovations we were taken care of for evening service in one of their restaurants. The food was tasty, but we were particularly impressed with the tuna tartare and the specialty Thai whisky cocktails. Breakfast was included in our stay and was easily the most impressive breakfast buffet spread I have ever seen. Anything you could possibly imagine — they had it. Thai, Indian, Japanese, western... I could go on and on. Even if breakfast is not included in your stay, do not miss it. Our room was beautiful, and they decorated it for us for our anniversary — so cute! I left a separate, more complete review of the spa however we were a bit disappointed with the Thai massage. While it was a nice experience, it was not a traditional Thai massage which I have had previously. Overall, we had a wonderful (albeit short) stay. I would definitely return on a future trip to Thailand! ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

79,4.0,"Staff at lobby are friendly.  As titanium member, I was given an upgrade and my room was at level 22. Room was cool, neat and tidy.  Room having most of the necessary items but lack of the shaver which I could have request for.  The gym was OK but unable to find the floor mat for abs exercise and also no area for user to really work on abs.  Overall still a good gym.  Pool is quite good as shelter and offers good view. Club lounge, staff is OK BUT the food is fantastic. There are both Thai and western choice for breakfast and cocktail. What I really like is that the chef maintains the authenical taste of spice and taste of Thai food. Location is near to BTS, all shopping malls within walking distance and erawan shrine Is just 3 mins walk away.  Overall Renaissance maintains Marriott standard.  What I dislike... The card access for the lift and to the club lounge. At times after inserting numerous times in the lift.  you will be worried that you will miss your floor as the button will just not light up.  To the club lounge, will tends to miss the slot as corridor is rather dim.  The access card is black  in color makes the whole situation worst as unable to see the direction for insert.  Still I will be back whenever I am in Bangkok. ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

81,5.0,"I have been visiting Bangkok for almost 20 years, but this was my first stay at the Renaissance Ratchaprasong.  Part of the reason for only just discovering the Renaissance is because I also lived in Bangkok for three years and stayed with friends after having moved away.  I know Bangkok well and have stayed at some of the best 5 star hotels in the city.  I can honestly say though the Renaissance is now at the top of this list.  As a Marriott Titanium Elite member, my choices for this trip were any one of the wonderful Marriott brands in Bangkok.  While I’m sure all offer similar comforts like the Renaissance, they cannot match its amazing location.  The Sukhumvit Chit Lom sky train stop is right outside the hotel’s door.  Given the fact that Bangkok ranks #11 as one of the world’s worst traffic cities, this is a HUGE plus.  If you want to go to the Chatachuk weekend market, the Sukhumvit line will get you there without even changing trains. A short walk away is also the Ratchadamri sky train stop on the Silom line which goes to the Chao Praya riverfront (Saphan Taksin stop) with access to Bangkok’s wats and temples via ferry and the Silom and Patpong night markets.  Also, some of the city’s best malls are within an easy 5 to 15 minute walk from the Renaissance - Siam Paragon, Central World, Gaysorn, Central Embassy, Amarin and the fabulous Cental Department Store.  Most offer first-class restaurants and incredible “food courts” with affordable and delicious international dishes and amazing shopping.One of the best parts of the Renaissance’s location is its proximity to Bangkok’s delightful Lumphini Park.  If you love to run or want to have an enjoyable walk after an early dinner, this is a must on your to-do list.  There are free outdoor aerobic classes, outdoor gyms, boat rides and occasional concerts.  It’s also the best people-watching around.  The park is completely safe even at night and is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel.  The Renaissance also has the best club lounge I’ve ever been to.  I watched as the lounge’s manager made sure that every possible comfort was afforded its guests.  The lounge offers breakfast, high tea and an incredible happy hour with a full range of appetizers and complimentary beer, wine and cocktails.  The service is impeccable.  If you’re looking for a wonderful, friendly Bangkok hotel that has it all, the Renaissance is it.  The rooms are well-appointed and spotlessly clean. It has all the amenities of a world-class 5-star hotel at a reasonable price with a location that’s absolutely unbeatable.  I am so happy I chose the Renaissance and have found my new home in Bangkok!",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

84,4.0,"This is a good location for shops, Sky train and central Bangkok. Rooms are a reasonable size with nice ensuite. Amenities in the room were not consistent each day. For example there was no body lotion for 2 days. We only had nuts etc on one of the turn down services. My only real reason for not giving this hotel five stars is that we had awful night sleeps. The bed is not very comfortable and the sound proofing between the rooms is non existent. We heard people talking at 1 am ,5 am and were woken by doors opening and shutting. We could hear people talking clearly in the early hours of the morning.On the plus side we had lounge access which was very good. Breakfast was enough and had a fresh egg station as well as local and western offerings. There is afternoon tea and 3 hours of wine, cocktails and also food for half an hour less in the early evening. The selection of food changed every day and was good. Lovely staff who were very helpful.Although we didn't try the indoor pool it did look nice. We did try the gym which has a reasonable range of equipment for a hotel but it was hot.

86,5.0,"Very nice hotel hidden within downtown busy district of Ratchaprasong. Ideally you do not get hustle or bustle of the busy roads and activity around Ratchaprasong junction as it is hidden like 400m inside. The hotel only requires a 4mins walk to nearby Gaysorn or 6 Mins to BIG C or Central World.The staff were super nice people, they helped to change me some small notes which works both way for us both. I recall a lady when I was checking in, I cannot figure out how much coins worth is there and I thnk there was a slight shortage and she just gave me a new 20baht note in exchange, very good gesture.Service is top notch, the moment you call for them for supplies or cleaning etc they responds immediately. You know sometimes even their sister hotel JW Marriott would have issues with operator picking up, they would pick up almost immediatelyWe used their gym and pool facility, would say they are more than adequate and not very crowded. Some food market event was held throughout the weekends evening at the hotel carpark compound when we were there, they comprise of all the hotels associated to the Marriott group hawking their best foods as street food for sale, we tried some of the stalls absolutely marvellous.Nothing to be faulted, would love to live there again next time. Hopefully try their famous brunch on Sundays too.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
87,5.0,"First time visit to Bangkok.  No city I’ve been in of this size seemed quite so chaotic. 5 minutes of watching traffic, including drivers ignoring lane markers, multiple lane changes for no apparent reason, and those motorbike drivers who seem to think city streets are for motocross, and we decided to let others get us around.  Fortunately, the navigator staff at the hotel was up to the challenge.  They found just the right tours for what we wanted to do, each with hotel pickup and drop off.  Yes, BTS station is “right here” but it doesn’t serve enough areas (compared to say, Tokyo).  To each their own.Hotel accommodations were superb; we were provided a small suite upon arrival (at 2 in the morning).  Bonvoy Titanium status does afford some benefits.  Corner room, large bath, king bed. Only drawback would be building right next door (behind our always-closed bathroom shade).  It’s a bit disquieting “sitting” in the room and having some office person working at exactly room level in space that seems to be 10 feet away!!That, fortunately, was our only downside.  We ate our breakfasts in Flavors rather than the club lounge.  I have enjoyed many fine buffets within the Marriott family (Singapore, Yokohama, Dubai and Budapest come to mind) and Flavors is as good as any of them.  If you can’t find something you will enjoy eating in Flavors, we’ll, you must not be hungry!Other reviewers mentioned how wonderful the staff here is.  I concur.  I found myself wishing I carted around pen and paper to note all of their names.  Alas, that would be a daunting task.  Front desk, housekeeping, greeters, bartenders and wait staff, it doesn’t matter.  Everyone made us feel welcome anywhere we went.  It’s a credit to management, yes. But it is also a credit to each and every staff member that embodies what JW Marriott said so often: take care of the customer and the rest will take care of itself.  I teach collegiate organizational behavior and use that often with my students. My sincere gratitude to each of you that I encountered.Finally, since it was the club lounge staff I engaged with most often, I want to say a special ‘thank you’ to those of you whose name I do know.  Dew (no pun intended), Little, and One: you made our time here feel like we were home (when , in fact, we were 9,000 miles from our home.  I will say it this way: thank you for sharing your home with us.  A number of you stated that you hoped we will return.  I don’t know about that, but I sure feel I’d be welcome if we do.Please consider staying at this hotel if your travels bring you to Bangkok.  I think you will likely experience things as we did.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

90,2.0,"I really wish this review could be a higher star review as I have stayed at this hotel many times over the few years it has been OK in the past but it's been consistently worse. Years ago when this was Starwood times were good but unfortunately status and being loyal to the property is barely even recognised anymore.I am a top tier member the Marriott program and I can say I have been fully #Bonvoyed this time. Don't get me wrong, the line staff at the hotel are very kind and do their best with their stretched limited resources, you can tell all the staff are very tired and overworked but keep a smile on their face.  The Thai people are very kind and will always help you when they can.Small things like a welcome card in the room are gone for people that spend 75+ nights with the brand. When it was SPG there used to be great amenities and welcome back gifts that cost the hotel nothing more than $5 each but meant a lot.  There isn't even fruit in the room anymore which is a common thing for even 3 star hotels in Thailand.I checked in past 3PM the normal check in time and long story short finally got into the room at around 9PM on the day of arrival. (Blamed it on a late check out guest) On that day I got a quick sorry and a few more excuses on why the room wasn't ready.  This was the most shocking part of the stay of which I am still upset about after traveling for for a day and half to get there and not getting a room on the guaranteed time.Note: There are not any traditional suites at this property except maybe the Presidential. They market a few of their upper rooms as suites, but are just basically slightly larger rooms at a much higher cost and really odd layouts. Literally they are just a slightly bigger space, no additional door separating the rooms, no additional powder room, dining space etc. If you need a real suite I would highly recommend other properties, all ""suites"" also only have a king bed so if you book 2 beds there are zero upgrades at the property. Note, if you do book a ""suite"" none of the curtains are truly black out, light will shine through the sides on all windows.I had issues with my key three times during my stay and was given different reasons each time I asked, but in the end it had to do with their vendors.  Also to note, there is zero ventilation in any of the bathrooms (no matter the room type) the bathrooms are very nice in size but they get very hot if the door is closed to the bathroom and or if someone leaves their scent it stays forever.Overall, the hotel is central there is no doubt about it but it is tucked a bit away from the BTS which is maybe a 5-10 min walk. It could be a really great hotel, the exec lounge is good but nothing I would pay for. During the breakfast they ran out of certain items as simple as coconuts which is a staple there.This property would really feel ideal only for business travelers staying a few nights The Internet cuts out everywhere you go and you have to sign on in different locations such as the lobby, room, lounge, gym etc. watch your roaming plans if you have one because the Internet can randomly stop if you don't log on.Overall, the hotel has potential it certainly does.  They keep it very clean and for its age it does keep well, but there are definite upgrades that could help the hotel. The line staff are very nice, but this is common throughout Thailand - the local people are hardworking and kind.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

8,3.0,"I stayed 2 times in the executive room at the same time. The first time was the 27th floor and the second was the 26th floor. The room: Chao Phraya River view is very beautiful. Sunset photography in the evening is spectacular. The room is beautifully decorated. Full amenities such as a sofa to sit and watch the river view, a luxurious Jacuzzi to soak in. In addition, the bathroom is separated between the shower zone and the toilet zone. The minibar is very affordable if compared to other hotels.Food: The foods we ordered for In-room dining were delicious Tom Yum Goong and steamed salmon with curry paste. I can sit and eat in my room and enjoy the view of the river. Breakfast was ok but not excellent. The cakes and coffee at the Coffee shop on the 1st floor are averages. Service: Before I check-in, I had been prepared about the service here from previous reviews. So, I didn't expect much. Front staff provided standard service and there was a defect in the number of days. But they fixed it as well. Club Lounge staff offered good service, greeted and said goodbye to all guests as well as delicious snacks and drinks with a stunning river view.My 2nd stay: Before I was preparing to check out, the hotel staff called from the front office to ask me that ""when would you like to check out? because our checkout time is 12.00 p.m."" I replied, ""I told the staff at check-in that I would like to check out at 2 pm"" (when check-in, the staff asked me that would you like to check out at 4 p.m. because you have been granted a Diamond Hilton honor member) That front office staff shouldn't call me like this because it looks so rude.

The service quite poor compare to the hotel in the same area, no greetings, no assisting, even the luggage was drop at the door, no turn down.

10,4.0,"I'm not sure why I'm writing this review as the management don't respond and I'll be repeating problems that many other guests have mentioned before, but here goes.The positives first.I took a staycation in a panoramic suite that had been recently renovated and was absolutely stunning; much more glamourous and interesting than it looks in the photos.The lounge was open and we enjoyed sandwiches and cakes for afternoon tea, and cheese, fried rice, (awful) tempura vegetables, and quite a lot of booze during the evening.It was my partner's birthday so the hotel gave us a cake and the lounge staff organised a 3pm check out, both of which were amazing- thank you!Why only 4.2 stars?The hotel charges a ""tray charge"" of THB60 to bring ice to your room. This is so nasty and is a money-making technique akin to a boarding-house, not a 5-star hotel. What's more, I had already paid a 10%  service charge so why they think it's okay to charge guests again is a mystery.  The other thing that brings this hotel down is how the staff close things earlier than the advertised time. The evening drinks are supposed to be until 19:00 but at 18:30 a kitchen porter was there ready to take the food away and by 18:50 everything was packed away-  ""finished"" the lounge attended gleefully announced when asked where the food had gone.   The same was with the breakfast which is supposed to close at 11 am but come 10:30 am, food is being packed away and the coffee machines are being switched off. I understand that staff want to go home as soon as they can, but for the same reason a guest would be denied service if they arrived late, the staff should not clear away so early. Also, pretending the food had ""finished"" when it hadn't (they'd just packed it away early) is not very good service at all.Additionally, the reception ladies need a few days of customer service training. They are a hard-faced crew who would be more suited to work at immigration  than a hotel- a ""hello and ""how are you"" would be better greetings than ""passports!"" and ""credit card you book with!""Again, this has been mentioned in quite a few other reviews but as nothing has changed, it must just be the culture of the hotel.Sadly, the pool area is an utter mess. I understand they are renovating but that does not excuse empty glasses and bottles discarded on the (ripped and stained) sun loungers.Finally, the boat service is still not in use ""due to covid"" which is a little silly as all the other hotels and the local authority have their boats whizzing around and I can assure you, the hotel is busy enough to warrant the service. The steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi are also either out of service ""due to covid"" or because of renovations- the staff I asked couldn't remember which excuse to give me so gave me both! I suspect that both the boat service and the sauna etc. are actually closed to save money.However, despite some of the strange rules and lacklustre service, I will return to this hotel.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Currently there are renovation in Lobby floor, swimming pool, and Executive lounge  which expected to completed all by May 21.

18,4.0,"We spend a two-nights staycation over a weekend.Check-in was super busy on Saturday but I still got a very friendly service and recognition of my Diamond status.We were upgraded to a beautiful Panoramic Executive Suite (#2802). The suites are showing their age although this room clearly was upgraded since our last stay about 3 1/2 years ago. We love the view from the room, partly over the beautiful Chao Praya River and the surrounding area.The Executive Lounge was unfortunately closed due to renovation works so the experience was shifted to a cafe next to the reception area. A bit busy for my taste but the spread was acceptable given the current situation. Breakfast was good although the line on Sunday morning looked like a bad day at immigration.What we did not appreciate was that dinner service consists of a buffet at the Flow and if you do not like that, the only option we had (on Saturday night) was to go for a dark snack on the rooftop. On days where that outlet is closed (which is pretty much the whole week), you may have to go for some food outside the hotel.Sadly, the river boats are also not operating at this time. What a shame. Many other riverside properties have this service now so not sure why our Hilton cannot.All in all, we still very much enjoyed our stay. The Millennium is special to us so we shall no doubt be back for more.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

She is beautiful and she always smiled and answered my questions about the diamond member benefits to make sure. When I called that hotel a few days before I checked in, the telephone receiver told me that 3 people could access the lounge if I put the quantity of 3 on reservation. However, it seemed to be wrong. I was actually ok then. What I was a bit dissatisfied was some of the guests didn’t wear the plastic disposable gloves when they picked up some food at the executive lounge. And the lounge staffs didn’t pay attention to that situation. This is just the feedback. Anyway, Ms. Noodle checked us in and out. Overall, I was satisfied with my stay.

The thing is my keycard cant access to the evalator! The reception said my card was registered just only for 1 night! My booking was 2 nights and repeat with reception when i check-in. In the evening i had buffet dinner at hotel, food was ok, not so much choice, but what is bothering me is some staff at food station they are talking each other with some swearword, there are still some customer at the restaurant, never expected i will heard that from 5 hotel.Also never sit outside next to the river again, been bite alot by mosquito.On my last day, my bf wanted to surprise me by sending a bouquet of flower for me to my room but i've received nothing. I check-out from the hotel at 12.00 and went back to my place. Around 3 p.m. my bf asked me if i have received any flowers? and i say ""No"" i've got nothing. So, i call back to the hotel and ask if there any flower for me from the flower shop? The reception told me ""yes, there is flower for you here at reception"" I was like, if i am not calling back to the hotel, where would my flower will be?? And why they don't notify me when i was still at the hotel or call to my number? They dont even offer any help or service to delivery the flower to my place.

24,2.0,"For sure this hotel need a lot of improvements. Although the lobby looks good but there are many details that i think should be improved from the hotel1. The shuttle boat not on serviced, as a five star hotel located by the River i believe its essential to keep this service to attract more people and compete with other hotels2. The pool is lack of maintenance, many dirty mark and also u can find some dry bird dirt on the mattress 3. It is the smallest 5 star room i ever had. Its like holiday inn level (you can even see the fridge facing you everytime wake up in the morning)4. The cleaning service is not the best for 5 star hotel. I found 2 pcs of hair on my sink and shower when i just came5. The bathtub is stucked cannot drain the water after taking bath6. I was surprised when i was asking for a mask, they sell it for 10 baht/pc. Which is quite shame while other hotels is trying to implement high standard of safety by just give away for a mask. (Their neighbor hotel beside icon siam even send me mask 4pcs on daily basis to make sure everyone stay save during pandemic)Hope there would be a good improvement further for a big chain hotel like this otherwise people will just move to other hotel with better services",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

29,1.0,"This is a third time to stay here and it's my mistake. I booked three booking at the same time and I don't know what I will see.1. I booked the room with campaign that can early check-in and late check-out. Firstly, I call to book directly to the hotel. No one tell me that it's not guarantee and I understand that It guarantee because It list on benefit of the campaign. 1 week before check-in, I call to front to remark them about early check-in, so they cannot do anything and ask me back to call them one day before check-in. OK, 1 day before check-in, I call to front again and they said that they cannot guarantee, please call them back on check-in day. On check-in day, around 10.00am, I call to front again and they say first come, first serve. This is so terrible for me and get me annoying.2. About hotel credit voucher 1000 THB, to use in the hotel. I want to make plan to use it as alcohol drinking. I call to Hotel and ask them Which restaurant can I use and Can I use with alcoholic drinking? they say that I can use only 2 restaurants in the hotel. After that, I check again with FB Messenger and they tell me that I can use 3 restaurants that I ask them back to ensure that why staff say difference but Staff on FB guarantee that I can use in 3 restaurants. At the check-in time, staff tell me that I can use only 2 restaurants and I ask them back that Can I use to drink alcoholic drinking? they say I can use it with amount of the voucher. After I've a dinner at ICONSIAM. I go to Maya restaurant in the hotel and ask them to use. They say I cannot use this voucher for any kind of drinking that declare in the voucher. Why? My plan is failed again and again. I make a decision to buy some beers at 7-11 and when I arrive to the hotel, I go to front and complain them about mislead information. They ask me to show message on my FB messenger that my phone is in the room. In my mind, What is wrong with you staff, Did you think I'm lie?. OK, I go back to the room and take my phone to them and they try to excuse with offer me to use the voucher as I wish.3. 3 times to stay here, I and my girlfriend see dust in the air at the room that I don't know why4. There's some maintenance on 5 December 2020 that is the Father day in Thailand. What the hotel thinking about maintenance in the peak period that Thai people need to stay with their family with a good mood. Smell is so bad in the lobby and they move front check-in to SPA.

Again, applause to the staff! They were well-trained and very very nice. I definitely feel that Diamond member has some value at this property. Stayed here for a whole week and it was great every day. They had a really huge breakfast selections. All type of Thai, Chinese, Indian, western food that I don't think I ate all of them in one week stay. There is a free transit boat to the sky train. The pool was really cool.

When I checking in, I ask the high floor and she said okay. I expect the 20 floor cause I can see the floor is available at the app. However she gave me 15th floor and I ask to higher room. She said all the guest should be stayed at 15th floor due to effect of covid19. I really don’t understand cause I already confirm the floor before the visit. I said the app showing that I can check in higher room but she still insist I should stay at 15th floor and it is the highest room where she can provide. Actually this is not my first stay and I visited this hotel 3 times even this year and this is the terrible experience ever. Finally I show her the app and ask to her If I check in at app with 20floor then what should you do. Then she change the room for me. Why she did’t gave the room before I show her the proof. I really don’t understand why she lying to me. From this experience, I don’t know well If I will visit here later.어플에서 높은 층 배정 뻔히 확인되는데도 불구하고 코비드때문에 다른 층 안된다고 거짓말한다. 어플에서 봤다고 하니 킹베드는 없고 트윈베드만 있다고 또 거짓말한다. 어플을 실행시켜서 보여주니 그 때서야 높은 층으로 배정해준다. 직원의 서비스에 실망이다",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

39,5.0,"For our first ever trip to Thailand, our family stayed at the Millennium Hilton for 3 nights during the Chinese New Year period. The service was so good that after returning from the Conrad Maldives, we ended up cancelling our one night stay on 31st Jan originally booked at the Sheraton across the river and stayed again this hotel.I'm both Hilton Diamond and Marriott Platinum so the elite benefits were similar, but the service offered at this hotel during our first stay was just beyond expectations, which meant it was a no brainer to stay here again during our final night in thailand.We stayed in the newly renovated Executive Panoramic Suite, facing north during our first stay and facing south on the second stay. The suites were excellent, clean, decent sized, and both directions had superb views of the Chao Phraya River.The location was perfect, right next door to the ICONSIAM with plenty of dining options along the River. You can exit the east side and also take a complimentary Hilton Shuttle Boat to Sathon Pier, which I did during night time, just to breeze through the scenic river and enjoy the night view. Most of the famous attractions in Bangkok were also situated along the River, so it was very convenient to explore from the Hotel.Dining at the Flow for buffet breakfast and drinks at the Executive lounge (with scenic view balcony) was great with a decent variety of choices. It was quite full during our stay but we didn't have any trouble finding a seat quickly.A big thank you to Meen (HHonor Supervisor) and Robert (Operations Director) for making our stay so memorable. We encountered some initial issues during the reservation stage, but this was quickly sorted out with their help. Personal greetings upon arrival made us feel very welcome and all special requests during our stay were accommodated, from a few tasty mangos, to pre-prepared takeaway breakfast early in the morning before our flight to the Maldives. These beyond expectations services are what really differentiates between the 5-star hotels, the things that we will remember, and bring us back to the hotel in the future!Much have changed in the last few months since our stay, but we hope everyone are safe and well at the Hilton. We look forward to coming back to the hotel, hopefully in the near future.SC",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

41,4.0,We stayed at this place for 7 nights and decided to change it up halfway through by changing rooms to face the other way down the river and it was great!! We did prefer the side facing the shopping mall and MO but both sides are decent. Try to get the highest floor you can and do check out the top restaurant and bar for some amazing sunset views. Unless you can enjoy the executive lounge as they have similar stunning sunset views! Really one of the best value for Money Hilton’s in BKK and the location along the river and next to a shopping mall is perfect if your going to China town or any Michelin star places. Ohh I almost forget the pool has a super view of the river a great place to have a cold one and get away from the hustle and bustle of BKK. ,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
42,5.0,"We went during the Covid-19 Outbreak, but after conditions were lifted for Local shops, and restaurants to reopen.Like most big establishments taking time to remodel or do some much needed construction. They set up a barrier, and did there best to make sure not to inconvenience any guest who decided to stay at the hotel. Which was very nice, and considerate of the management to think of the guest first. This Resort is located in a very awesome location that has a back entrance where you can access the river front, as well a near by local market where you can eat local food as well shop for some medium priced wears. You can also find fairy access to go across the river to visit the local temple as well.Near by is a SkyTrain station soon to be completed as well the road ways.Current check in times location during the mid-day you check in at the 31st floor, in the afternoon will check in at the front desk. Covid Hours: Check in 12PM - Check out 3PM/15:00Normal Hours: 3PM/15:00 Check in, 12PM Check outYou can always ask to get your bags checked in, as well request early check in or late check out.Tea Time: at a price of 15$ per person, you  get a simple plate of assorted snacks as well fruit, which includes your typical choices of verity of tea, coffees, as well sodas of your choice. Served on the 31 floor of the building which words cannot describe the view that you get of the “Chaophraya” river as well Bangkok city line. Out of the snacks we got the green tea cake was the most delicious out of the whole set.... but might have been to sweet for some individuals. But due to my unique sweet tooth I found it rather tasty. In-Room Dining: Yes a price tag, but the food is worth it.Cesar Salad: Idk if it’s made fresh dressing, but for sure taste like it. If it was not then I for sure would like to know the brand. Very good it also came with some sorted bread making it even more worth it.Raadna Talay: Seafood Thai style noodles the flavor was on another level.Restaurants are limited due remodeling or closed because of previous restrictions set up due to the Virus. So I can find it understandable with the situation, they handle it with pre menu set of Bento boxes set up for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner with 3-5 options with Asian or Western choices that you can select from. The Bentos were amazing from ether the Asian or Western Style the cooks here know how to cook any style meal so far from everything that I have tasted.They really do the best at everything they can to accommodate the guest in any way even in selections. Was really impressed by this. The staff from beginning to the end of our stay was 100% fantastic, very professional, as well courteous of what ever was needed. Rooms are typical set to a U.S price 130$+ pending on which style of room option you like to have for your stay this is only due to the Covid. Rooms on a typical average in the 300$ plus. I do suggest the rooms with a standard or Pano view of the River you will never regret the cost due to the awesome view you get to see with your own eyes.Note: If you getting a Taxi ride be carful, from our experience our driver didn’t want to go through the issues of driving directly into the Resort, assuming due to road construction reasons.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

K'Pakkad is absolutely amazing she is so polite, helpful and always willing to go out of her way to help her guests as well as K'Ning, whos service was amazing she was doing everything possible to make sure I had a very memorable stay and I am ever so grateful. K'Dan the Concierge is an absolutely class and elegant professional who is extremely well spoken. I was also extremely lucky to meet the FOM K'Nee who made me feel welcome from the very first moment I arrived, constantly smiling and making me feel as if I was a very valued guest of the hotel. She was absolutely fantastic and i could not go on to praise her more for her outstanding hospitality and customer service. The team she has downstairs at the reception, bell boys, concierge is extremely efficient and clearly under great leadership. Once again all areas of the hotel was amazing and I would recommend anyone looking for an amazing hotel to stay at in Bangkok to stay here with confidence as from the views, location, service and facilities they are second to none! To the team at Millennium Hilton Bangkok. Thank you so much for the best ever stay at a Hilton Property",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
55,5.0,"We stayed at the Millennium for three nights and it was honestly faultless. The staff were all so friendly and accommodating and the room was spotless and had a great view of the city.We had breakfast in the hotel two of the days we stayed, everything was lovely, fresh fruit and yoghurts, omelettes made to order, a lovely selection of baked goods, etc. We made a visit to the pool on the 4th floor which is absolutely lovely and again, so clean! Really refreshing to go for a dip.The Three Sixty Bar was great at night for panoramic views of the city and lovely cocktails (the ginger martini was a personal favourite).",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
56,5.0,"Being a Hilton Diamond member, we were granted early check-in and late check-out. We also had access to the Executive Lounge, which has a beautiful paranomic view over the River. All the staff at Millennium Hilton Bangkok are very eager to help and had provided top-notch service. Overall, we are very happy with our stay there. ",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
57,4.0,"Returned to this hotel for a short stay, 10 years after my last visit. The newly renovated Executive Suite was indeed comfortable. However, housekeeping had done a poor job, as the carpets had not been vacuum cleaned  from the previous guests (we found lots of potato chips, clusters of hairs, paper- and plastic pieces on the carpets), making us feel the room was not clean. The room was then serviced once again.Also, the room was very hot throughout our stay (despite adjusting the air con to 70 degrees on full speed). Indeed, we found all the public areas in the hotel to be very hot, especially the Executive Lounge. The staff in the Exec. Lounge were professional and friendly, thank you! However, in spite of offering one of the best views of the Bangkok skyline, I found the furniture to be somehow tired and outdated as well as very uncomfortable. Also, I found the food & beverage offerings to be on the very low side compared to other high end hotels I have frequented in Bangkok during my many visits to the city.Breakfast was a huge disappointment. The variety was huge, but the Egg Benedicts that I ordered were the worst I ever had. The buns were hard as bricks and the eggs were overcooked. My wife did not enjoy her picks as well. HHonors recognition was excellent.All in all a nice hotel, but with the large competition in the hotel market in Bangkok, I have to say that in my humble opinion there are better hotel choices in Bangkok these days for the same kind of money.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
58,5.0,"Hotel is located right on the river front with access to the riverboat to the BTS station Hotel is next to the ivonsiam shopping mall, we stayed in an exec room on the 27th floor and the view from my room was my best view ever !!  Breakfast was really good too with a high quality and choice of food ... The exec room gives you access to the roof bar and between 5 and 7 is free cocktails and drinks with snacks and is a great place to see the sun go down over Bangkok ! A really great hotel and staff",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Easy to walk to Icon Siam shopping centre, free boat service to Sathon pier for get on BTS. We will back to visit again.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
60,3.0,"Apart from the view which is stunning, everything else about the Millennium is underwhelming.The rooms are clean but basic, complimentary water but thereafter drinks are 10-15x the price of the 7/11 opposite.The pool area is frankly odd - the swimming pool is covered meaning the water is an icy 23c. Part of the lounge area resembles an I paved car park while the bar is nothing more than fridge and trolley.We weren’t allowed to checkin before 3pm so had a lengthy wait - at 3pm they were having IT issues so we had a further wait while we were assigned a room.Overall it’s suggest avoiding - there’s better hotels for the price range. ",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
61,5.0,Every time we visit Bangkok we stay here and everytime it is perfect. The service from the staff in all departments is impeccable and they have always provided kind and friendly service on each of our visits. The breakfast is also fantastic and great value for money. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
62,4.0,"Nothing overtly wrong with this property. Location is on the ""wrong"" side of the river for most Bangkok attractions, and getting over by Taxi /Grabcar can be slow in the usual traffic shenanigans. Check-in experience was disappointing due to the speed and general disinterest of the staff on the desk. They weren't rude, just not engaging or friendly, and very transactional in their approach to guests. Room was clean but bathroom very small for a suite. ",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
63,5.0,"This is an excellent hotel with superb service. We stayed in a Family Suite on the 17th floor for the extra space and were not disappointed.This hotel is situated next to a gigantic newly built shopping mall with multiple food options, although I had the hotel’s own prawn Pad Thai by the pool and it was fantastic. Ah, the pool, in an area on the fourth floor known as The Beach. We spent a few hours there and it was a lovely start to our holiday. You wan walk in a few inches of water between the loungers (and there are enough of these with some underneath gazebos and also some big beanbags available. You can look out to the river below and see (and hear) the many boats passing by. It’s good, as you are high enough to have some peace whilst at the same time there is good visual and hearing stimulation, I think that works really well. The air was surprisingly good there too, but the nice cooling breeze probably helped in that respect.We went up to the jazz lounge on the 31st floor on our first evening, where there was an excellent singer and a talented local band who played requests. It is not cheap there, a Singha beer was £7.50 (so about $10), but I guess you pay for the ambience and the view too, which were both great. The next evening I went up to the outside bar at the top and got some great photos of the sunset at the decommissioned helipad (just above the excellent bar). So for two nights it was a great experience all round.We only had breakfast once, but there is plenty of choice and the smiley chef even introduced himself to us and said if we needed anything to let him know. A nice touch and a good example of this hotel’s excellent attitude to service.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
64,5.0,The breakfast buffet was excellent! There were many selections with an assortment of foods from many parts of the world. The service attendants were great with removing our dishes and asking us about coffee refills.,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
65,5.0,"Really enjoyed the welcome, the rooftop view is flawless! Really clean, great service, food and staff.Our room had a view to the River, we really enjoyed. They decorated the room really nicely for our honeymoon. They gave us a map of the city and perfectly explained how to get to all the tourist attractions. Walking distance from the new shopping center IconSiam and they tons of stuff in there (indoor floating market, great shops, cool night fountain shows).I would for sure stay here again. ",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
66,3.0,"Stayed a this hotel many times but things went off the rails this time. Luggage got lost a concierege, taking an hour to get reolved then disappointed to recieve a hand written additionl  cost  as a I checked in stating that my 5 year old daughter will be charged 700/baht per day for her lounge access, however this was not visible on the website at the time of booking .A very stiff charge for someone who has coco pops for breakfast and some satay skewers and a juice in the evening. A bit of a bitter pill. Only ever had good experiences within the Hilton brand to up to this point being a Diamond member for over 10 years always made things better but not on this occassion.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
67,4.0,"We spent 5 nights at this beautifully situated hotel on the Chao Praya River.  We stayed here several years ago when the shopping and night life were across the river but now the exciting IconSiam center is right next door with shops, restaurants and a fabulous fountain and light show 3 times per evening.  There is a convenient regular shuttle boat to the BTS station. As Diamond members we were given a renovated room on an executive floor.  The room was quite small but functional and had a great view of the river.  Two negatives about the room:  there was no hot water to the sink no matter how long you let the water run and there was a faint smell of sewer at various times during the day and night.  The executive lounge on the 31st floor had stunning views, and good food and beverage offerings.  Breakfast at Flow was excellent with lots of variety and sitting outdoors one could enjoy breakfast whist watching the boats on the river.  Hotel staff did their best to keep the pigeons away from the dining tables.  The gym had a good variety of equipment though the tv function was not working on any of the treadmills, so some updating required there.  We’d definitely stay at this hotel again as it is so conveniently located.  ",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

69,5.0,"We were on Celebrity Millennium that docked for two days at the LAEMCHABANG port, so we decided to stay overnight at the Millennium Hilton in Bangkok.The hotel is located along the Chao Phraya River.  We were picked up by Hilton’s ferryboat at the SP Taksin Bridge.  The boat ride took about 5 minutes.  We were too early for check-in, so we left our luggage at the hotel and went to the shopping complex next door for lunch.  By the time we came back to the hotel, our room was ready.We were on the 14th floor overlooking the river.  The room itself was small but comfortable.  Breakfast was in a large airy restaurant with a lot of international selections.  To visit any of the attractions along the Chao Phraya River, we had to take the hotel’s ferryboat (runs every 30 minutes) back to the Taksin Bridge and pick up the public boat from there.  It was very convenient and cheap.  We paid 20 Baht ($.65) pp to go to the Grand Palace. Millennium Hilton is a beautiful hotel and every staff member we met was attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, we only stayed here for one night so did not get to enjoy the hotel’s many amenities. We would definitely stay longer next time we are in Bangkok.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
70,2.0,"An old property which has become an attractive location due to its immediate proximity to Icon Siam, the latest and best mall in Bangkok. However, its age shows as public areas look out of date. The pool area is a disappointment as its not at all an area to relax unlike other pool areas of similarly rated hotels in Bangkok. The rooms are small. This must be one of the few 4-5 star hotels in Bangkok with no espresso machine in room. There is also no turn down service. The bathroom amenities are of poor quality. Cleanliness is an issue. A cockroach was found in the bathroom. Check-in and out process is slow and with long lines, the process is even slower and not what is expected of this class of hotel. Staff at check-in and out are robotic and process driven and smiles are plastic. Not a pleasant experience for meI would only recommend this location if one needs to be near Icon. Otherwise there are far better options.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
71,5.0,"Stayed here during a short 3 days holiday and loved it. My HHoners status was recognized, and I was given a high floor room with a superb view over the Chao Phyra river. The room was well appointed, but on the smaller size. Service was generally outstanding, especially at the lovely lounge during sundowner time. Breakfast at the main restaurant was great in terms of quality, service and setting. Overall, highly recommended!",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
72,5.0,"The location and the views is what gives this property a resort feel. Nestled between Iconsiam and Khlong San Market on the river with easy connection to various city highlights is its strongest point. Everything else is just icing on the cake.Booked 12 nights using a mixture of cash and Hilton points - 10 nights family suite and 2 nights of Panorama suite (booked what I could find) for 2 adults and our 2 children (ages 8 and 11). Got 6 nights of family suite and 6 nights panorama suite due to availability. This make it being upgraded 4 out of the 12 nights or 34% upgrade rate as a Diamond elite member of the Hilton loyalty program - an accomplishment in my opinion considering that is was the busy season and they are fully booked through the holidays. We thank the hotel management for this generous upgrade. Both suite types were lovely offering panoramic riverside views, elegantly appointed, comfortable beds, great water pressure in the shower even though we were on the 26tth floor, ample toiletries/amenities, espresso machine, Singha bottled water, etc. On two separate nights we watched the fireworks above the river, the bridge, and IconSiam.Executive Lounge: Mediocre F&B but again the views are unbeatable. For alcohol beverages during happy hour, they only serve 4 kinds of non-premium liquor plus beer and wine. They run out of food fairly quickly and they don't replenish timely. They even run out of utensils and the staff seem nonchalant about bringing more out.  Teatime is available for early afternoon snacks and beverages. Seating is available indoors or outdoors with expansive views of the river and Bangkok skyline. Silly that they won't allow guests to sit/use in the circular rotunda between 11 am-5 pm using the excuse that they are cleaning the place. The staff are hit or miss with most are miserable and some are hostile. Despite of the heroic efforts by Khun Nuch and Khun Wink to make us welcome, our time at the lounge was not enjoyable and on the final day we avoided the lounge altogether. Attitude shown by staffers is that guests are burdensome, especially the kitchen guy in the white garb! If it's not included in your rate, I don't recommend you pay for the lounge access.Breakfast at Flow: Great riverside location to have breakfast as the variety, ingredients, the preparations, and the service are all top notch. I have watched the staff manage the waves of guests showing up to partake breakfast and they always performed flawlessly. The buffet fare typical of most top notch Bangkok properties with fruits, salads, cereals & breads, cheeses, cured meats, eggs station with accompaniments, sweets & pastries, noodle station, Thai and Asian foods including Miso soup and assortment of Taki, etc. Would like to give special thanks to Khun Aiws (at the sushi/cheese bar) who went above and beyond the call of duty to make our dining experience enjoyable. The boat ride: the hotel offers a comped scheduled shuttle boat to Sathorn Pier where you can take the BTS (Bangkok light rail system) for easy access to Bangkok's areas of interest. On Christmas day we were dropped off at a pier close to Assumption Cathedral to attend the mass. On the way back, we were fortunate that the hotel manager was in attendance and was gracious to summon the boat back to said pier for a return trip to the hotel. Thank you Khun Josef for your hospitality and concern for your guests.Service was disappointing at the lounge but great elsewhere in this hotel especially at Flow during breakfast, and by management staffers who were very accommodating. We thank Khun Rose and Khun PK for attending to our every need. Not only they set up a Christmas tree for us in the room to celebrate the holiday properly, they also sent us a delicious cake and a bag full of baked goods as Christmas gifts. Thank you so much for your generosity and hospitality. All in all, we highly recommend this property for the accommodating management, the location, breakfast by the river, and the views.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Finally, I appreciated the extra effort of Meen who was working at the HHonors desk.

80,5.0,"We loved our newly renovated panoramic suite! The decor was fresh and modern, with enough Thai elements in the decor to give the hotel its unique cultural identity. The light-flow was superb and the bed very comfortable, making it a sanctuary in a big vibrant city! The shuttle boat was punctual, and a comfortable, efficient way to get to Saphan Taksin BTS Station, from which we can easily access the rest of Bangkok. If you love malls, Iconsiam is a mere 5-minute walk away! The staff at Flow did an admirable job seating fussy guests during breakfast; they ensured that tables were cleared and coffee topped up promptly. The young gentleman who was assigned to clean my room on the 23rd floor on the 27 and 28 of January, was hardworking and efficient, and he was always so cheerful and positive! Thank you Khun Sy (I hope I remembered his name correctly; management please assist to identify and commend him for us). The Executive Lounge staff were fantastic! Thank you, Khun Enjoy and Khun Ann, for the warmth and hospitality! We also enjoyed a wonderful evening at Three-sixty rooftop bar! The soft-shell crab salad was excellent! Our compliments to the chef! We felt that overall the Millennium Hilton did very well, especially considering that it was the Chinese New Year season, and occupancy was probably near capacity. However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the breakfast could include an on-demand juice station, and freshly cut mangoes, in line with many other 5-star hotels. Secondly, while the offering during happy hour at the Executive Lounge was alright, it was far from the most impressive we’ve had. And finally, we felt that the food options in Three-sixty was rather limited. In many good hotels, the staff would gladly offer to bring you the menus from other in-house restaurants, should you request for something not listed in the menu. On a final note, we had a memorable stay here, but while staying by the river has many advantages, we also like city-centre hotels that offer direct access to a Skytrain station.

The personnel behind the front desk are extremely professional and have always been incredibly helpful. There is nothing they won't do to try and accommodate your needs when reasonable. The food in any of the restaurants is spectacular to say the least, not cheap but a cut above. The breakfast is probably the best in Bangkok, in my opinion..They have both Western and Asian options, fruits, salads, pastries and more..I have been coming to BKK for over 15 years. The front desk always acknowledges my status as a Diamond Level member, welcomes me honestly and most recently upgraded me to a panoramic suite on the 15thfloor.This hotel is popular among Japanese and European guests alike...Many tours operate with this hotel in mind..The ""Staff"" members and employees, from Front Desk to Housekeeping, Food Service to Valet are a big reason I return a couple times a year.

The connecting Club rooms were awesome, clean and with all the amenities you need but the best part is the view!

It is also in one of the best locations in Bangkok what’s not to like!! ,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
98,3.0,"I have stayed here a few times now and the lack of consistency in service is what lets this hotel down.This trip I had a exec room reserved and checked in at the lobby where I was expecting to be taken to the lounge to complete the formalities, however, this didn't happen.No recognition of HH status and I was allocated a room adjoining the lift shaft which was incredibly noisy so requested a room change. My profile on my account clearly states a room away from the elevators is my preferred choice, but seemingly ignored.The room itself was fine, albeit a little on the small side, but the view over the river was very good and the soundproofing seemed to be effective.My previous review of this hotel commented on the poor quality of the food and beverages offered in the executive lounge and sadly nothing has changed since my last visit. The view from the lounge is amazing, but the three days I was here, it was overcrowded and not a very relaxing atmosphere. Service was slow and some of the staff gave the impression they didn't want to be there.Food again was mediocre and the wine offered wasn't the best with the food having to be continuously replenished due to the numbers of guests in the lounge.Despite notices clearly stipulating that kids under a certain age not being allowed into the lounge during the drinks service, this was not enforced by staff and totally ignored by irresponsible parents who think it is OK for their kids to run around the lounge uncontrolled and let them poke around the food with their bare hands, although it has to be said that many adults also seemed incapable of using the serving tongs provided.There is a lot of construction ongoing outside the hotel with the new skytrain link causing a lot of disruption. Getting the taxi here was a nightmare and the traffic is horrendous. To compound the problem, traffic accessing Iconsiam gridlocks the surrounding roads during peak hours.I would avoid the area until the construction is complete and easier access to the hotel via the Skytrain is completed.Clearly the hotel must be maintaining its occupancy levels despite the erratic service levels and perhaps they feel that they are fulfilling guest satisfaction expectations.Unfortunately they didn't with this guest!",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Japanese buffet at Takumi is very goodThe most disappoint is breakfast, I have it on 14 Nov on 0800 am where nobody there. Hotel serve as a la carte due to less guest. But staff are not attentive, they keep talking to each other. I have to call for coffee, and have to get the sauce basket from the selves by myself. The quality is also not good, cold bacon, sausage. Another thing is swimming pool, the hotel allow guest to use maximum 2 ppl per hour, you need to make reservation in advance. It will be good if staff inform us upon check in, but nobody inform us at all. This is rather disappointment.

I felt very wellcome, when I arrived by taxi and because I am a regular guest, I could do the check-In in a private surrounding on floor 21, next to the Executive Club Lounge. I just had to do 1 signature, because all the paperwork was already prepaired and in addition I got an upgrade for a Junior Suite. What a perfect start into my holidays. In my Junior Suite everything needed was already there, not to mention all the amneties and especially the coffee machine from Nespresso. I did not miss any artikel in the room, so what do I want more?If you book an Executive room or higher, then you get access to the Executive Lounge on floor 21, what means everything is included in the room rate and where you can enjoy the meals in a private surrounding, starting by an oppulent and exclusive breakfast buffet, followed by afternnoon tea / coffee with delicious sweets etc until to the excellent drinks in the evening, perfectly accompanied by the very talented employees Zaizy, Chane, Mint, Fang and actual the trainees Cherry and Guy. I also want to say thanks to Jar (reception), Sommon (guest relations) and Ithidaj (guest experience). They all are just heartful people and I felt there very homy during my stay of 10 nights.In addition, I also have to mention the perfectly organised loundry service. If the loundry is placed at the reception until 10 am, you get it back the same day in the late afternoon and believe me, it really works. The loundry is brought back to the room, perfectly wrapped, as you ordered it.Of course, I also want to say thanks to the people, who open the door every time at the maine entrance with a big smile and also the employees at the front desk, changeing also money etc. etc.Last but not least, I also have to talk about the relativ newly renovated fitness room on floor 5. All the training machines I used, worked very well and the rest rooms / changing rooms were clean and I loved specially the rainforest showers.All in all, it was again a perfect stay and I certainly will come again soon.

The evening cocktails and canapés were also great and we received excellent service from the team - in particular Salinee, Mint, Farm.

38,4.0,"Last year I wrote a glowing review of Swissotel Bangkok and I did not feel the need to provide an update until things changed.  Unfortunately I must now report on significant cutbacks at this hotel regarding room Platinum upgrades and happy hour.  Service remains great and breakfast in the lounge is still top notch but going forward my enthusiasm is more tempered about returning.In the past I booked the Executive Suite and received a one-category upgrade to the Crest Suite as Accor Platinum.  For this stay I again booked the Exec Suite and I saw online that the vast majority of room types were available at time of check-in including the Crest Suite, therefore I was surprised to find out at the front desk that we were not getting upgraded.  Staff indicated that they no longer upgrade above the Exec Suite level.  This is disappointing and is akin to the policy we experienced at Banyan Tree Bangkok last year: if you book a suite you won’t get upgraded. In my opinion this is not competitive with other hotel chains where you can book a suite and get upgraded to a premium suite but in any event I can adjust my stay pattern accordingly.  My takeaway is that for stays where I want to book a suite outright there are better places to maximize value where they do not hesitate to upgrade to premium suites.Happy hour in the lounge has been cut back from 2.5 hours to 2 hours (6-8pm) but the most disappointing aspect is what they now offer in the lounge.  Whenever a lounge goes down from luxury appetizers such as oysters to mini-pizzas, that’s quite a fall from grace.  For this stay they also had tonkatsu and sushi but they frequently ran out and were very slow to refill.  We were only about a dozen people in the lounge so it was still quite peaceful and a pleasant environment, and remains superior to the Banyan Tree lounge.  However 12 guests in the lounge is not many – struggling to keep up with refills leaves room for improvement.Breakfast in the lounge remains a strength of this hotel and I did not observe the same cutbacks as for happy hour.  They had seafood fried rice, the cold buffet also had scallops, mussels, and shrimps – very few lounges have such offerings for breakfast.  To go along the buffet they still have an extensive a la carte menu prepared by the chef at the live cooking station; I am glad this has not been taken away.  Fruit selection is also above average: I tend to rate breakfasts higher when they have special fruits such as mangoes and Swissotel ticks the box in that regard; they were so juicy!  The lounge was very peaceful in the morning: only a handful of people were there besides us.  Given that Athenee Luxury Collection Hotel (which is one of the higher end hotels with a lounge in Bangkok) has cut sparkling wine from breakfast in their lounge recently, an argument can be made that as far as lounge breakfasts go, Swissotel is one of the best.Besides food not being replenished fast enough in the evening, service in the lounge remains superb – staff is always friendly and attentive, they recognized us from before and addressed us by name, etc.  Overall I was disappointed by the lack of room upgrade and the now subpar happy hour.  Given that the drawbacks of this property have not gone away (location, aging hardware), I must be more tempered than last time in my assessment of this hotel.  The breakfast and service will bring me back but possibly not as often as before because the recent changes are negative.",Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada Hotel,4.5

61,1.0,"The Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada must have been a very glamorous hotel in its heyday. It has amenities that back in the 90s must have very much impressed its guests: a centralized control for lighting, air conditioning, and radio; a 'Please wait' button next to the toilet to politely ask visitors for patience in case you were thus engaged; and a hi-fi sound system complete with CD and tape players. The vintage feel, however, extends to the rest of the facilities - carpets and upholstery are tired and stained, the in-room air conditioning is noisy with an ineffective thermostat (freezing when on, sweltering when off, neither bearing any link with the temperature setting), and like the rings of a tree-trunk, you can probably date the fixtures through the layers of crusted dust. The kindness of the staff, low price-point for the hotel category, and the location for some meetings, makes up for it. What I couldn't really get over was finding a (dead) bug pressed between my bedsheets on my first night, which means that this went through a washer, dryer, and ironing process without the bug being found. More disturbing, though, was finding a reasonably large nail fragment under the edge of my bed when checking nothing rolled under it upon check-out.This is probably a one-off experience, but I will avoid this hotel in the future if I can.

At the time I booked, they told me a room is 25 sqm, but I got the room that is less than 20 sqm when checked in.

After we asked to switch the room we were moved immediately. After going to the front desk at 13:10 we were told that we have access to various amenities.

Staff doesn’t care to help, is rude and doesn’t speak any english what so ever, not even “hello”.We reserved a room for our honeymoon and specified this in the reservation along with a large bed preference. We received a small bed, with windows facing a loud construction site, 2 meters from the window. After we asked to switch the room we were told to wait for the next morning. In the morning we were told to wait until 13:00 for when the manager will arrive. After going to the front desk at 13:10 we were told that we waited in vain and the manager is at home, and if we want to switch, to pay double what we already paid.Everyone was rude and kept saying “farang, farang”.

4,4.0,"We stayed 3D2N @ Vince Hotel in Feb 2020. This hotel was new and room was nice (we had a triple room), room size was good.The breakfast was up till 11am which gave us ample time to eat. Selection was not bad too. There were many photo spots in the hotel. Nice decor. The hotel also had a corner where you could try on the traditional Thai costume for free ... costume and all accessories included. The staff at this station were really nice and even refused to accept our tips.The only issue we had was the location of the hotel. As we were all female group, it was inconvenient at night (there’s a stretch to walk back to hotel which was quite quiet and dark). But luckily they had a buggy transport service. But the transport service is only to certain point ... eg : Soi 15 ... so there’s still a stretch which we need to walk.There’s no massage parlour within the hotel. But the buggy was able to drive us to the cluster of massage houses near Soi 15.Overall ... nice hotel ... nice service ... if only the location is better ","Vince Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

It is not crowded and chaotic.  A very good location its near Big C ( a supermarket that opens til 2am), Siam Paragon (a high end shopping mall where the luxurious brands are house) and the MBK.Its near Chatuchak market too as it took us a little 30mins going home.Staff/s: Attentive and provide your needs.  Very good staff/s.Food:  Breakfast is included in our room, and they served very good food.  As everyone’s observation, the room is too cold though!  Over all they deserves two thumbs up in the kitchen.There is a transportation being offered by one of the travel tours inside the hotel and we grabbed the opportunity from the floating market, pattaya and to airport, a good provider of transportation too.  It lessens the hassle of haggling with the taxis and tuktuk. I highly recommend this travel tour agency.The rooms, are nice and big enough for us.  Overall,  its a good place to stay on.","Vince Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

After all we found that hotel charged the amount twice, but at booking.com it shows that reservation was cancelled for free. The hotel did double charge and refuse to refund money. Moreover, tried to charge third time on check-in, as they couldn’t find records of reservation. Hotel do scam with credit cards, stay away from it.

The only complaint we had is that the internet was pretty slow and we had to re-login often.The service was good and the staff was very helpful. The room was nice and clean, comfortable, and not too loud even though it is in the middle of down town. Breakfast was better than other hotels we have stayed, and the public areas are comfortable.You can tell the hotel put their heart into the business. It’s not super big but the design is thoughtful and considerate. I like the little details such as they give you 2 different colors of toothbrushes in the room. And offer big bottle of shampoo, lotion so there is less waste and better for the environment. Close to business center, but quiet. Very relax stay here. ","Vince Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
8,3.0,"Firstly, I would be wary of all the 5 star reviews below as most of the contributors have only reviewed this hotel and nothing else, which seems fishy to me. Saying that, this hotel is pleasant, great decor, free unlimited popcorn (although the cups could be bigger), the breakfast spread is amazing compared to what you get at other hotels, a 7/11 vending machine for anything you might have missed getting from the shop. The rooftop pool was a lovely place to chill after a day of shopping at the nearby Platinum Fashion Mall and the complimentary tuk tuk service is great.The rooms are really nice too, great bed and comfy pillows. Although if they don’t spend money on keeping the rooms, I can see the rooms not looking as nice in the photos in a couple of years. HOWEVER, if you value sleep then I wouldn’t necessarily recommend staying here. The walls are paper thin, I could hear the couple next to me having a conversation, the child across the hallway screaming AND they have music playing near the lifts 24/7 so if you’re in the room next to the lift, good luck? Also, because it was a national holiday and there’s some sort of car garage next to the hotel, they were doing karaoke which was blaring into my room. All I’m saying is BRING EARPLUGS!

Some alleys when walking back to the hotel dark at night (no street lamps). Hotel staff tries to hail taxi fr main street for us, appreciate tt. Need to call for buggy at the various stops, whatsapp would have been more convenient for travelers without free calls. Not an issue if you use taxi to get around. Sound proofing of rooms not so good, can hear doors slamming fr other rooms at night.

3,4.0,"A really Nice place, for a short stay, if you have an early flight, the next day. Very friendly staff. The only negative thing, was that the airport shuttle was filled with mosqiutos, literally 50 or 60 mosqiutos in a car, is pure torture. ","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
4,3.0,"We booked the Cottage for one night because we had an early flight to Europe and free shuttle service to the airport was available.The hotel looks a bit dull, but the room was okay, there is a nice swimmingpool and we had quite a good sleep. Our room, however, was next to the elevator which produced a disturbing sound everytime it was used. Breakfast was simple but okay. But, prices being so low, don't expect a Hilton experience. By the way, the nextdoor Robinson Mall is awesome.......","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

6,5.0,"I've used this hotel before, and I'll most likely use them again. The airport shuttle personnel [in red] are easy to find, the check-in process is smooth, and the rooms are adequate. I usually arrive very late at night, so I don't want to be messing around. The staff is friendly and efficient.The buffet is OK. Traveling is a difficult process--I'd be willing to pay more for the room to get a better quality breakfast. Honestly, I think this part could be improved. The street food in bangkok is such a high level. If the breakfast here was MUCH better, this would an ideal hotel for me. I like to use this hotel to be close to the airport on the night of arrival and before departure. It's good to reset before exploring the rest of Thailand.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
7,3.0,"The hotel is beside Robinson mall. The breakfast is good. The shuttle bus to from the airport is on time. They don't have coffee, tea, or heating pot in the room. Only one pillow per person.

Need to go out door 6 and although a little difficult to find signs for shuttle, when we saw the van, we were greeted with a friendly face and arrived at the hotel in no time.Room is clean and sufficient for my 2 nights stay during short transit. Pool was lovely and quiet, though small.We booked a room on 1st floor with pool access. It was great with a little balcony with a couple of chairs where you can watch the kids play in the pool. My family stayed right next door though rooms were not adjoining, but easy access between balconies.There is a new Robinson's mall short walk (maybe 2-3 mins walk) where there is a food court and supermarket, restaurants.

Massages nearby. Pool water - very cold, my guesstimate 21-22 - can cool you down or wake you up, not the best for a long play with kids. staff very helpful and OK. all in all - medium","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
11,4.0,"We stayed here coming into Bangkok and leaving as it was close & convenient to the airport. Pleasant friendly helpful staff. Very reasonable, pool & restaurant onsite, would stay here again.Used a Suite with adjoining rooms for 3 persons on arrival & a Queen room for 2 on departure. Not close to City Centre, need to take taxi to rail into city sites if visiting for longer. For connecting to other areas in Thailand by air and needing to overnight - this is the place.Booked directly online with The Cottage and got discounts (not expedia or tripadvisor). Changed dates without issue, correspondence takes 24 hrs due to time change.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
12,4.0,"Almost everything about this hotel is moderate: the distance from the hotel, the quality of the rooms, and the quality of the restaurant. the service is excellent, but the shuttle is difficult and time-consuming to use, and isn't free. The price is excellent.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
13,4.0,"This hotel is perfectly adequate for the airport (15 - 20 minutes in the hotel shuttle minibus) and Robinson's shopping mall ( 4 minutes on foot) plus Paseo Mall (8 minutes walk.)There is a little garden to sit in and relax plus the swimming pool.It's extremely quiet, situated down a side road, so traffic won't bother you. We had an early 6.00am departure for the airport so the hotel provided us with a picnic breakfast, which we ate in the airport - again perfectly adequate for the start of our journey.In addition, there was hot water available in the lobby - very useful!Thank you Cottage Hotel.P/S I really liked the tall Palm Tree leaves outside our balcony...greenery and nature in the metropolis!","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

17,4.0,"This place was amazing! The breakfast buffet was awesome as well as the restaurant! I can’t really say anything as at all, because the staff was so amazing and respectful and the shuttle from the airport made getting to the resort so much easier! There is a new mall next door to the resort and ATM access is not even a block down the road! I will definitely be staying here when I return to Bangkok!","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
18,4.0,Stayed at this hotel twice for one night before and after a flight to Phuket from Bangkok airport. Great location with free shuttle service although you do have to wait if arriving/departing in between the scheduled times. Only general issue at present is the noise form the building work being carried out next to the hotel - even too noisy to stay out near the pool in the day time and it did go on after the supposed published finish time of 8.00PM. Also on our second stay the air conditioning in the room was not efficient as in the room on our first stay. Breakfast good. Staff very polite and helpful. We did eat dinner one night in the restaurant and that was fine too but also I would recommend a great food court in the mall near by. Otherwise no complaints and i would definitely stay here again.,"The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
19,2.0,"Compare to the other for hotels I stayed in Thailand this was overall the poorest. It is close to the airport and priced decent, the room is plain, needs a good cleaning and maybe a picture on the wall, one night would be different but two was too much. Staff were present but not overly helpful.  I wouldn’t walk any where after dark and the sky train isn’t conveniently located and good luck getting a taxi back from the sky train to the hotel!  Breakfast compared to all the other hotels was not desirable. No I would not stay here again.    ","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
20,4.0,Stayed at the cottage during a 10 hour bkk stopover between Melbourne and Phuket. Location can’t be beat. Easy to follow instructions were given to find the transfer staff at the airport. A quick 10 minute aircon bus ride to the hotel was appreciated.The room was small but comfortable and clean. The bathroom however needed some love. The tiles seemed a little grimy and could have used some attention. The shower lacked any form of water pressure. That said with the price per night which was inclusive of the transfer I can’t complain.The transfer back to the airport the following morning was an easy process with a similar journey time.All in all not a bad place for 1 night considering the price.,"The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
21,4.0,My wife and I stayed here during a 12 hour overnight stop over and found The Cottage clean and comfortable. We used the free shuttle both ways. The breakfast was good and there were more choices than we expected.Staff were helpful and courteous. Overall very good value for money and we are staying again in March next year.,"The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
22,3.0,"We had one night in Bangkok in between flights so booked the cottage as close to airport place to recover from jet lag. It was quick to reach by taxi from the airport and check in was smooth and efficient. The room was basic but had everything you needed, most importantly air con. Breakfast was included, but we weren’t overly impressed by this, it was a mixture of Asian cuisine and Continental breakfast. The staff were helpful in arranging transport and be warned if you want to go into the city centre it’s quite some distance, we had no problem getting there cheaply on meter in a taxi but on the way back all the drivers refused the job of taking us back unless we paid double off meter. Overall we wouldn’t want to stay here for more than a night or two at most, it’s a little basic but certainly did the job for a bit of rest. ","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

26,4.0,"Just a pre warning if staying in October. Too the left of the hotel is a large building site, operating several hours of the day. So be aware about the noise from the site, Exspecially after a long half flight. Apart from this is was a Great stay. Very clean & modern. Plenty of places to sit and relax. Great shopping mall & markets located 5 mins away. Rooms are spacious clean & comfortable. Air con is high spec. Wifi is good. We asked for a pool view room (but subject to availability) the pool a good size and very clean. The only downside which isn’t the hotel fault. However they should pre-warn guests of the building works too the left of the hotel. It’s quite noisey at times. This can be frustrating for short stays after flying. However we was the closest room too the site. Therefore noisier for us but we didn’t mind. Other rooms may not hear it as much. Staff were so polite and friendly. Would Still recommend. ","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
27,5.0,"Chose this hotel for its location which is near the airport and it offered roundtrip transfers which was convenient for us since it was only a 10 minute ride away to the Suvarnabhumi aiport. First impressions? We missed our airport ride thru no fault of our own, since our flight was delayed, but arrangements were made and we were transported in an aiport taxi which was paid by the hotel. Reception was quick, front desk lady was all smiles, and we were allowed an early check-in. (TripAdvisor's anniversary treat maybe) We were tired but wanted to explore Thailand early, so to save time,, we tried out our first local meal at their in-house restaurant, the Amigos and we were not dissapointed. Their Pad Thai was so good (it was the best tasting, out of the 5 restaurants i tried all over Bangkok). Hotel facilities were good, our twin bed room was more than enough for our things, aircon was cool and quiet, bathroom was clean, only the hot water in the shower was not hot enough. And even if our English was not that easy for the staff to understand us(we wanted directions and we were taken somehere else), we managed to get by on our own. We stayed for only 3 days, maybe i will stay longer the next time, and if only for their delicious Pad Thai, someday i will!","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
28,3.0,"Our flight back to Manila is at 1130am and to avoid skipping our breakfast and  the traffic, we choose this hotel because it's near at Suvarnabhumi airport. We left the hotel at 8:20am and we arrived at 8:40am, no rush. We booked two rooms for a group of 6 pax.Staffs are friendly especially thosein front desks, they're warm and helpful, even those at the Amigos restaurant. Breakfast are adequate, enough to fill your empty stomach.Hotel was old and need some renovations. The aircon in our room does not function well, we complainabout it and they let us transfer to another room with new aircon as according to the one who assisted us, but i am still not satisfied with the cooling power it produce. But the other room has enough cooling power. Hope all rooms with good air conditioning.Overall, i will come back if the aircon will function well. The hotel has a pool.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
29,2.0,"We decided to book this hotel for our last few days in Bangkok because it was close to the airport and thought that would provide us more time to spend shopping before going home - BIG MISTAKE! We wasted more time (and money) taking cabs to all the worthwhile shopping spots than we would have with a one hour cab ride to the airport at the end of our trip... Lesson learned. It's hard to get TukTuks or even Grabs to take you back to this spot from places like MBK, Siam, Asiatique, Chattuchak, etc - they'll look at you like you're crazy unless you're willing to shell out the dough. The pictures are misleading, anyways. That pool is no where near that beautiful. The rooms weren't that great either. Unless you've got something to do around here or need 1-night stay, don't book!","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

31,3.0,If you are visiting Bangkok for very short period of time like 1 day or 2 days. This place is good. Rooms are comparatively small and they do not provide safe inside rooms.

32,4.0,"Located in Latkrabang a 20 minute drive from the airport this hotel is a very good option as a transit hotel. It is close to the airport, provides roundtrip transfers and provides just about all you need for a good nights sleep.It is a budget hotel so dont expect miracles. The room is basic, its a bit dated allright but nice and clean and big enough. The staff are super friendly. They speak good enough english and make you feel welcome as a guest. The hotel has a small restaurant but you can find local food stalls if you venture outside.The wifi was ok, not brilliant and not bad. Note: my pick up at the airport did not work out but they happily refunded my 120 bath taxi ride. Pick up area is on the 2nd floor at Suvarnabhumi airport. Suggestion: contact the hotel in advance and make sure they have you on their list and tell you where excactly to meet the hotel representative.But all in all its definitely recommended. Good value for money. ","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
33,3.0,"The lobby is small and was full of cases when we arrived. The room was small and not as it looked in the pictures. We had a pool room, but didn't know there was going to be  a lot of work going on next to the hotel. Noise, and then workmen overlooking the pool did not make it very relaxing. Some of the staff were helpful and others just seemed to sit around on phones. I was put off by flies in the breakfast room and no-one clearing plates on the tables. Shuttle to the airport included in the price. Good for one night, as it was for us, but wouldn't stay any longer.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

I ended up carrying my bags to the room myself.I had booked the pool access room and I expected it to be a better level given the higher price but i found the room in disrepair, mold in shower and a air conditioner that sounded like a train keeping me from sleeping at night.A kettle and cups was provided but no complimentary coffee or teabags where provided in room.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

Adequate breakfast selection however hot food needed to be warmed in the provided microwave as it is cold.

41,3.0,"This is a fine airport hotel for a stop over near BKK.  Be aware that the shuttle from the airport is on a schedule so it is not on demand service as it is made out to be on the website and in their communication.  When we arrived the shuttle driver was ""on break"" for an hour and half so we had to take a cab and pay for it rather than wait for his break to be over.  This was despite my emailing the hotel to confirm that they would pick us up at our arrival time.  They never mentioned the schedule to me.  The rooms were fine and the hotel was perfectly fine for a stop over.  The air con did work but it took a while for the room to cool down.  The Paseo mall is close and there is a Korean restaurant there that was excellent.

Also complimentary was the breakfast buffet, which offered all your western staples, like pancakes, toast, cereal, coffee, juice, fruit, and even pad Thai! All the facilities were fairly modern, including our room, and the staff were friendly and helpful, even if their English wasn’t.

After spending a few days around Thailand we returned to the hotel because it is quite close to the airport. This time we had to wait about 30 minutes for our airport transfer. We arrived at the hotel and had two separate beds pushed together. My husband went to reception to find out why we were in this room and all they could say was that guests could not choose what rooms they want, we only get what is available. Yet we booked the double bed room 3 weeks before arriving at the hotel. The room is clean but very small. Beds and pillows are extremely hard. I slept without a pillow.

Room was basic, but spotlessly clean and tidy. What more do you want. They also had free shuttle bus to the airport following morning which was an added bonus, and was great service. Pool was lovely and refreshing, but my only complaint here would be the sunbeds need replacing. Some broken, and some very hard indeed. Lovely little suntrap though.There is building work going on all around and I note other peoples complaints, however, it didn't bother us, and to be perfectly honest, it wasn't loud or in your face, it just sounded like everyday general noise. No issues.Five min walk down to a mall, which wasn't thebest, but it had a little outdoor market and food and was great to pass an hour or two before an early bed for an early start to the airport.Would defnintely stay here again for an airport overnighter.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

Food in the restaurant is adequate, nothing too exciting. If you don't want spicy food make sure to make it VERY clear, as I got a spicy chicken coconut soup after asking for not spicy.

Check in was like a war zone, there was luggage everywhere strewn around Reception area (mostly belonging to backpackers who don't seem to consider anyone else bar themselves)  After negotiating my way through that mess, I proceeded to my upgraded Superior Room with Pool View.  Well what a joke that was but the again it was April 1.  I was on level 3 down one end.  The room was as basic as they come, very small and lacking basic amenities such as a kettle to boil water for a cup of coffee and not even small rubbish bags in the room bins.  As for the pool, it couldn't be seen from inside the room.  You had to go out on to a very small balcony and turn your head hard right to see it.  On the plus side, the staff were very friendly and eager to help.  I am a frequent visitor to Thailand and regularly stay overnight in Bangkok on my way to my family home in Chiang Mai.  Over the years,I have stayed in a number of these overnight hotels close to Suvarnabhumi.

The room is of a comfy size but pls, in this weather, the room aircon is old and not working. The bed was obviously 2 singles combined into 1 and as there’s a lack of resources, the 2 single blankets were combined into 1. There are no basic amenities eg slippers, toothbrush etc etc in the room and there’s a smell in the room. Lack of powerpoints are another boo point to the stay.

Our choice of room was 'a deluxe pool access' with breakfast and round trip taxi transfer included.The hotel is located down a quiet side street in Lat Krabang and is roughly a 10-15 minute drive from the airport. The round trip taxi service was excellent and the Thai guy who drove us on both occasions was a star, possibly the best part of our stay! The hotel is also handily situated a 5 minute walk from a night market and small mall which offers plenty of choices for street food, shops etc.First impressions were good on arrival, we were checked in by pleasant staff and the lobby looked clean and modern. We were then lead to our room on the ground floor just around the corner from reception. On entering I was hit by 2 things at once. Firstly a feeling of being very underwhelmed (deluxe?) and then by the oven like heat after leaving the icey aircon of the corridor. The room reminded me of many of the cheap condos that are thrown up all over the touristy areas of Thailand. Much smaller than expected with cheap chipboard furniture and poor quality fixtures and fittings that are either broken or chipped, scratched or corroded. A few fellow reviewers have mentioned that the hotel is old but I honestly don't think it is. It just wasn't built to last! We then went to inspect our 'pool access' terrace which was one of the main reasons we booked this place as we love pool access. It was very disappointing to say the least to see the tiny terrace with tatty old furniture and no pool access! All rooms around the pool are poolside and NOT POOL ACCESS! There is a difference! Our dismay continued when I asked the staff about the pool itself. Our plan was to go out to eat then to come back for a swim around 9.30pm. The next morning I then planned for an early morning dip before our flight. Our dismay continued to mount when we were informed that the pool closes at 9pm and reopens at 9.30am! So what you have is an airport hotel that has people coming and going 24 hours a day and paying for a pool (and an access room!) that is open for less than half a day?! It was at this point we just shrugged our shoulders (it's only for 1 night was our mantra!) and went for a swim and to be fair the pool itself is ok. We then returned to our room that by now should have been lovely and cool because we'd left the aircon on for almost an hour. In actual fact the room was still swelteringly hot, much hotter than outside.  At this point I went straight to reception and politely asked for some assistance with the aircon and 10 minutes later a guy arrived. I watched him unscrew the unit, wipe the filter and put it back. He then assured me that given a little time it would cool the room. I doubted this as I likened his 'repair' to my car not starting so I take it for a valet! We then went out for an hour and returned to our unsurprisingly still roasting hot room.We then made the mistake of not insisting on a room change and tried to get some sleep. We both managed a very uncomfortable 2 hours maximum sleep writhing around in this hellish,  expensive sweatbox. The next morning we both agreed it was by far the worst night of our fantastic 6 weeks in Thailand. Before leaving we had breakfast which I really enjoyed and informed staff of our poor quality stay. They seemed sympathetic but not surprised.The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel does have some positives. It has a good location, a great taxi transfer service, the staff are pleasant and the food was enjoyable. Unfortunately at the time of our stay the the negatives outweighed these factors. It's not particularly cheap (we paid £40), the building construction is poor and the room fixtures and fittings are cheap and worn. I'm not the only reviewer to mention faulty air conditioning. I have to say that I'm amazed by the number of 4 and 5 star reviews this place has and I consider myself to be a generous reviewer! As many reviewers write, the internet pictures do appear to be photoshopped as they look nothing like what you actually get! In my opinion the only salvation of this hotel would be a massive refurbishment. If you do get a great price and think this hotel is for you I would offer this advice. Inspect your room before accepting it and for goodness sake CHECK THE AIRCON!!! I wanted to like this place but following our experience I really don't know what would make me want to return. Next time we need an airport hotel we will be returning to the Suvarnabhumi Suite which is better on every level and cheaper by at least £10!","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

It is very close to the Bangkok Airport, which was a plus for us, and, we found the staff to be wonderfully attentive, personable and pleasant! Their tour office provided just what we needed with a driver who went the extra mile for us!  Also, and not least, my husband accidentally left his iPod their on the first weekend we stayed there, with a planned return the following weekend but no way to contact them because we went on a retreat deep in the jungle. Upon our return the following weekend they had his iPod secured and waiting for him! We were so grateful, and pleased with their integrity!

87,3.0,"A quite good hotel, we paid 1587 baht for one night, that included transfer for two pax to Suvarabhumi. We arrived after 9 PM, and wanted to go out for dinner. The local place just across the street had just closed so we went looking for another place. If you turn right just outside the hotel, and then right again at the main road and walk for approx 4-5 minutes you’ll find a huge food court called Paseo. There you will find all the different food you can think of. We left early so had no chance to try the breakfast. Nice and friendly staff, easy with the transfer in the morning.

89,5.0,Thanks for staying up past midnight to wait for us to get to the hotel! The room was standard and that's all we needed for a few hours to sleep and make our connecting flight to Phuket. They organised a airport shuttle for us which was nice of them and the check in process was quick and hassle free.,"The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
90,4.0,"We booked directly with the hotel for an overnight stay as our connecting flight is 10 hours later next morning.  Finding the free shuttle to the hotel is not too difficult once you understood how the system works at Suvarnabhumi Airport.  We wait 15 minutes at the meeting point for the shuttle to arrive and journey time to hotel is approximately 15 minutes.The rooms and linens are clean.  Pillows are my level of hardness with one soft one for my son.  Bed seems to be overworked on one side but still functional.  Bathroom is clean and water pressure good.All in all if your expectation is set correctly and you are looking for a clean, functional room to spend a night in without spending too much. This hotel will provide.  Novotel it is not.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
91,4.0,"Stayed here on both our flights in and out Bangkok Airport.  This a decent , no frill, and convenient place to stay for your transit flights.  Our room is spacious, clean and decent size bathroom. The airport pick up location is a bit unclear but once you found it the shuttle will arrive in 15 minutes. If you made the booking directly with the hotel,your name will appear on the notice board which makes it even more convenient.The breakfast is considered above average for a 3 star hotel and the small pool will be handy if you need some relaxing moment between your flight. The friendly staffs are always ready to help and arrange the shuttle back to airport.A 5 minutes walk to nearby Paseo Mall where you can have some meals and do some shopping. A night market is there as well. The only negative point is the construction that is happening behind the hotel but its only begin work at 8am and stop by 6pm, so no issue for us.Overall, very satisfy with our stay here and will be back for our future connecting flight stay.To those who have negative reviews about this hotel a akin to paying a 3 star rate and asking for a 5 star  service.Overall , very satisfy with this hotel","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5

93,3.0,"Okay for stopover one night as there is 24-hour pick up service from airport. Reasonably clean room. Don't expect too much from the property and you will be okay. Location is in obscure neighborhood, although there is some mall nearby. Reception is polite but we feel they try to make some extra personal income --- different rates for breakfast depending on who you ask. Generally it's about 200B per adult and sometimes they charge 150B per child. They offered ""hotel transfer"" to our next hotel at double the rate of private taxi service. That was pretty strange. Food in restaurant was simple but very good quality.","The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
94,3.0,I stayed one night at the hotel. I appreciated the airport round trip shuffle service. Breakfast is served as a buffet style so you can go for thai or more continental type.Front desk staff was attentive and helpful .Room is as described however pics may be photoshopped a bit.

95,2.0,Located about a block down a dirty alley way off the Main Street. Garbage everywhere. If I would if stayed any longer I I would have gotten a couple garbage bags and picked up the trash. The hotel need updating. From the locks to the lights everything is showing it’s age.  Bathroom leaking water all over the floor. Air conditioning slow and poor. Staff barely speaks any English. Pool area needs work. No cushions for the loungers. The picture on the internet shows a beatiful Oasis with nice soft loungers. When we inquired about the cushions we were told they haven’t had any for a long time. Internet and WiFi were absolutely the worst actually there was none!!  We were told it was down until the following week. When I put the pressure on because I had to reply to some work emails I was given the staff password and had to sit in the lobby. Next day the password was changed and nobody knew what the new one was.  Which is BS. I don’t think this hotel is up to any western world codes.  The TV only has Asian channels that work.In general I don’t think this is a tourist hoteland wouldn’t recommend staying here unless this is the way you live at home. It appeared that this hotel has long term rentals. On the plus side!!!!!! Great little ma and pa kitchen across the alley way. Good food and pleasant service,"The Cottage Suvarnabhumi Hotel, Bangkok",3.5
96,2.0,"The best of this hotel are pictures on the booking websites, besides that the rooms are medium low quality, the pool is dirty and the breakfast is awful.

They explained even clearly in details that my room would be ready however an additional request I made at short notice might not be ready. There was no problem for me at all.I arrived at the hotel by driving and this hotel provided a convenient car parking space where I just hopped from where I parked to the elevator which connected me right to the lobby reception. With luggage I had, I did not have any difficulty at all.I was revived warmly at the reception by Montana and Varaporn who kindly assisted in completing the registration so swiftly. I was escorted and informed clearly regarding hotel products and services - even how often they serviced the hotel shuttle boat to the prime riverside spot!I was so grateful for the hotel management’s kind consideration for allocating the most stunning view room for my special occasion stay️. The suite was so spacious, tidy and homey feeling. I have to spatially thank Kuakul from Housekeeping who made her kindest effort to decorate my sleeping bed so exquisitely.The overall room facility was all my need for a night stay.

One thing I personally like to suggest is that it would be so good to have a water hose installed at the toilet.The facilities in and around the hotel were just perfectly convenient. There was a 7-eleven convention store located just in the same vicinity. There was also a beautiful small garden right from the main entrance to the riverside pier where the hotel shuttle boat service was on standby every 30 minutes for departing to main Saphan Thaksin pier.I was also thankful Chalida who checked me out of the hotel who provided the hospitable service with her lovely smile.

My family pigged out on an English, then vindaloos, then salami salad, with capers and fresh walnuts.  Assorted Thai dishes were obviously available too.  Sided with this was an assortment of fresh bread, washed down with strong, freshly brewed coffee.The infinity pool on the 6th. floor is what you would expect.

I would prefer having that tiny balcony added into the in room floor area. Upon check-in we requested if a late checkout at 2:00pm would be possible and they said ""only for the 4 rooms and until 1:00pm for the twin room"" so we were fine with that. We checked-in around 4:00pm and they gave us 2 rooms first saying that the other 3 rooms were not ready yet because we want rooms on the same floor (isn't it obvious that all bookings were named after 1 person and there's a high probability that we would need rooms on the same floor?), we turned a blind eye on that because we want to have a swim first.The next day we swam again after breakfast-- Breakfast was decent with very attentive staff specially Ms. Angie. When we came back around 12:20pm while at shower the phone kept ringing. Then my friends from the other room said that the receptionist called telling that we should checkout. My friend said that we requested a late checkout when we checked in, then the receptionist said that they will only allow 2 rooms. We were like ""what happened?""-- then we  moved to the 2 rooms hurriedly while my other friends just came out from shower. How does endorsement run in their Front Office? If they really need the room I would understand, given that they should've informed a night before or even hours ahead (this decision making is a matter of commonsense).When we checked out we were the one who said thank you upon leaving the lobby door. I don't know if they are too busy, feel guilty of what they did, or they were just pissed off that we didn't post yet the TripAdvisor that they are soliciting to post when we checked-in in return for the late checkout.","The Quarter Phromphong By UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

They are perhaps the sweetest, yet most invisible people in the entire hotel. However, I deeply appreciate and acknowledge their presence. At FNB, there is a young gentleman who is always cheery and has a memorable hair style. There is another host who stoically yet efficiently runs the floor - always offering bacon or omelette. The lady also is all smiles during breakfast.The trifecta of front desk ladies: the assistant manager, the courteous Filipina, and Beam all seem to effortlessly charm the guests, including myself. Business is indeed sweet as usual. The bellboys are good. Ma and the other gentlemen are professional and always prioritize guest satisfaction - a strong addition to the team. The security team also deserve a mention as their responsibilities are truly challenging, yet they still miraculously manage a smile.For the night shift, Sky and Mickey are nice and fun. Yet perhaps due to odd hours or inexperience they drop the ball on service once in a while but definitely make up for it and more at other times. Consistency of service would translate into leaps and bounds towards improvement.My hat tip to Khun Ohm for leading the team thru example at such a high level, I truly understand as I myself am also a leader behind an amazing team. I look forward to an even more pleasant stay at The Quarter.","The Quarter Phromphong By UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

91,5.0,"Quite conveniently located, the hotel is a great little gem. Very tastefully furnished pristine rooms - mine was anyway. Whilst not huge, the room was very comfortable with a great bed and bedlinen. Perfect for a good night sleep. The team members, especially those at reception, were always very friendly and helpful - always with a smile - small but highly important thing especially since my stay was during the Covid-19 crisis. Special mention goes to the shuttle service the hotel provides to the nearby BTS PhromPhong/ EMquartier shopping centre - on one of my excursions out of the hotel, the driver, who had somehow recognised me (i was several minutes away from the hotel by then), stopped to offer me a ride as he was going past - it was a gesture but one that goes a long way.","The Quarter Phromphong By UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

1,5.0,"Another Bangkok staycation - so I decided to check out a new property in one of my favorite neighborhoods, Silom.     After I read the TA reviews and saw the incredible prices for the Quarter Silom, I booked using their website.    Check in and out were positive experiences as staff easily communicated in English.    But the reception area is small so I can see that it might get hectic with large groups.     Further, the parking situation is limited for but it’s easily accessible via the BTS or Grab car.   As mentioned the property is new so the room furnishing are very nice and there are plenty of outlets for devices.    They also have mood lighting which was a fun touch.     The bed and bedding are good quality and it was easy to fall asleep quickly.  Strong consistent wifi throughout the room and property; as well as a good AC system.    The shower pressure is strong and there was plenty of hot water.    The room also had a kettle, mini fridge, and microwave.   The hotel offers an inexpensive breakfast including Western and Thai offerings.   Overall the buffet was just ok and this would be an area that they could easily improve.       The property also has a well equipped fitness center including wet and dry saunas.    There’s also a small pool.      Overall - a very positive experience especially given their low rates.

Back then the price was around 420baht a night. In March in decided to stay here for 1 night. The price is now about 200 Baht more but the service is still the same. Everything nice, good and super professional. The price is reasonable. The hotel is located near the Si Lom complex with nice restaurants and shops inside. It's close to the lumpini park (15min walking),  close to the Bts Sala Daeng (walking around 8min) and close to the MRT Si Lom (walking around 12min). For short and long stay I can highly recommend the Quarter. With a motorcycle it's only 10min from Asok/ Sukhumvit where the Terminal 21 is located. The Quarter is not a skyscraper hotel.

It’s great breakfast and worth the price and convenience. The pool and bar on the 18th floor is awesome as well.The hotel is right next to a 7/11 which was super convenient for snacks for our kids. It is also conveniently located within walking distance from Mercuryville, Central World, Siam Paragon shopping centers as well as Lumphini Park and Erawan Shrine. The staff was incredibly sweet and accommodating, especially Naphat, who was always there to guide our Grab cars, answer our questions and suggest great places to visit closeby. Also worth mentioning is the Diora spa, a few steps outside the hotel. It is a bit more expensive but worth every penny for a luxurious massage or spa treatment.

9,4.0,"We recently stayed for one night as I wanted to take the kids to Harborland and the hotel was offering a promotion with free entry, along with room upgrade, early check in/ late check out and free meal for kids. It was a good promotion for the price. We had a two bedroom corner suite on the same floor as the pool which was very convenient. Being relatively new, the hotel is clean and modern with a stylish pool/ bar area. Breakfast was good, if a little limited, but the lunch we had was a little disappointing. Another downside was they only issued one room key and this stopped working a couple of hours before check out. It was quickly resolved, but not ideal when you’re trying to get your kids showered and changed after swimming,Staff were friendly and helpful. We’d definitely stay again if they ran a similar promotion, as the hotel is in a great location.",Sindhorn Midtown Hotel Bangkok,5.0

5,4.0,"We did a quick staycation at the Banyan Tree, and stayed in one of their club suites. There's a lot of positive things to say about this hotel. First, the location on Sathorn road makes it pretty accessible to things. The sheer size of the hotel, at over 60 stories is pretty impressive. And the rooftop bars and restaurants are really hard to beat. The views from the rooms, and from the rooftop venues is really quite exceptional. Overall the experience here is good. You shouldn't be disappointed with a stay here. The hotel interiors are beginning to look a little dated, though. Not because they are worn out, but just because design trends have changed, and newer hotels reflect those changes.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5
6,5.0,"No words can describe how good my experience was on the Saffron cruise by Banyan tree and the level of detail and organisation from Jim who helped me to organise a surprise engagement proposal to my girlfriend (now Fiancé, she did say yes!) Jim organised everything for me, where the best seats were for the proposal (table 61 upstairs, on the top deck in front of the beautiful Wat Arun), arranging a bottle of champagne, Flowers and getting a book on the boat secretly so that my Fiancé would not know. From the moment we arrived on the boat the service was exceptional from our waiter First who was amazing from the moment we got on to the moment we left the cruise, we was escorted to our reserved table for a pre drink overlooking icon Siam and all the beautiful places along the river, then we was escorted down to the dinner table and a bottle of champagne was waiting. A massive thank you to the chefs also, the food was amazing, it was the best red chicken curry  we’ve had since being in thailand over two years! First our waiter then escorted us back up to our table to have our dessert, where the proposal took place, First and his team helped to film it and take lots of pictures for us to make our evening really special and one we will never forget! This is by a mile the best river cruise we have ever been on, it is pure luxury from start to finish, service, food, comfort, drinks was sublime.A special mention to Jim who planned and organised my whole engagement idea from the Banyan tree side and also to First who took some incredible photos of us and helped us the whole time and having to serve other tables.

27,3.0,"We booked this hotel at the last minute due to what we thought was a very competitive price for a 5 star hotel. Alas, having just stayed at the new Marriott Marquis on Sukhumvit Soi 22 and the Marriott  in Hua Hin, we realised how spoiled we had been in those new and fresh hotels.The Banyan Tree is set back off what is a very busy road, with not much close by.  It is surrounded by high rise office blocks, so not a particularly convenient or interesting location.  When driving into the hotel, you have to go behind the building that is on the road. When you get to the drop off area, it is very small, un-inviting and with no doorman waiting outside. At first, we thought we had inadvertently arrived at the service entrance to the hotel.The doorman, singular, was ok but not particularly friendly or welcoming. Check in was smooth and efficient.On going to the room on the 23rd floor, we noticed that the hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed properly. Some of the wall paper was peeling from the walls. On entering the room there was a damp smell. The room is quite tired, the TV is small and ancient. Initially, the TV didn't switch on when I pressed the power button on the remote. I had to actually find the power button on the TV itself, to then put it on standby, before the remote would work. The TV also looks ugly, with cables hanging down from under it, with an old and frayed cable tidy, and an ancient infra red mouse eye clumsily stuck onto the exterior of the screen. The channel choice is average, the wifi is adequate. The room comes with a coffee percolator, which is nice. However, housekeeping had not provided any of the coffee bags for it to work. However, when I called reception, these were provided quickly. Alas, the coffee was not to my taste anyway. The shower screen has not been cleaned properly, with smears on the glass.  The bed is comfortable, but the pillows are quite thick, so may not be to everyone's preference. They provided a small fruit plate in the room, and the minibar is quite well stocked with a good selection of spirits and wine/beer. In summary, with the huge choice of hotels in Bangkok, I would not stay here again.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Thun is very friendly. After met me at arrival hall, he brought me to the limousine. Along the way, he tried to engage with me by starting small talk & provided me necessary info. He even asked me if I would like to use washroom before depart from airport as the journey will take approx 40mins to hotel. So caring Next, I met K. Suthep, the limo driver. Another guy with a warm smile (even covered with mask) make me feel at ease. He checked on me to ensure that my whole journey is comfortable. He is very knowledgeable even just joined the company for 6 months. The whole journey is flawless. When I reach hotel lobby, the Front Office Manager K. Oat already waited me at the entrance, with welcome drinks & snacks. After having a cool chilling homemade welcome drinks, I was directly escorted to my room for in-room check in. WOW! WOW! WOW! The room was SUPERB! With a nice setup of welcome amenities (yummilicious snacks prepared by chef) & nicely printed photos in frames placed in the room. This make me feel really like my HOME. The team is so resourceful and pay attention to every single details to make me feel like home. I think they know that I have not back to my hometown for at least a year due to COVID-19 situation. So lovely! After a tiring day of travelling, K. Kanya, the spa therapist really make me whole body very relax. The 3 hours treatment was really FANTASTIC. Royal Banyan Spa Package really worth for a great experience. I even snooze off several time because it was too relax & his skills is really fabulous. After spa treatment, is dinner time! And i misssssss Hong Kong cuisine so much. I was craving for it for several months as I couldn't travel to Hong Kong. So I went to Baiyun Restaurant. Opps... I forget to make reservation and was fully booked  The hostess told me that I need to wait around 1.5hrs for the next table. After 30mins, the hostess called me that there is a table available. Yahoo... The waiters & waitresses have been very nice to me as I was dining alone. They keep on checking me if I like the food, the food is enough and etc. They recommended me all yummy food. Excellence service. Thanks to the chef too. Yummmmy dimsum Everyday I passby the lobby and met the Security & Concierge. They always greet me with a warm smile. I can feel it even they were wearing the mask. I can sense the warm & sincere greeting & care. Maybe this is the authentic Thai culture? And the FAMILY hospitality by Banyan Tree? ️️️Excellence memorable experience. I shared all my sweet memory in my social medias & definitely a highly recommendation to my friends & family.

The service was so great, it was really beyond my expectation, male staff who had taken my photos during our dinner is professional in photoshoot, also other staffs who have taken my photos when I was on the moon deck. Especially service from Khun Fern and Khun Jack is exceptional, they have very service mind, Khun Fern has escorted me from the dinner table to the moon deck and taken care of me since then, and she appeared again with surprised birthday chocolate mousse, I know it is quite windy on the way from the lower deck to moon deck, and I saw her best effort to escort the cake to celebrate me. I would say that this is an unforgettable experience on my birthday celebration. I would suggest everyone to  experience such a great dinner cruise with Saffron Cruise.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

60,1.0,"We both have travelled a lot and have stayed at the Banyan Tree many years ago. Not a lot has changed in decoration and style. We booked a suite as it was a good promotion but the price is not the most important part for us, as that would be the experience and good service. (Days, weeks, months or years later people have forgotten about the price but the good memories or bad have not been forgotten)Lobby was ok (not a grand style) and looked fine but it was not cozy. We checked in and were given 2 keys and pointed to the elevators. We did not had many bags but the bell man sorted our bags out. He did not enter the room but that was ok. We were very disappointment by the room. The bedroom had NO WINDOW and was dark. The room was very cold and the colors in the room were not warm either. The ""sitting room"" was nothing special but it had a window, however the window was blocked! (When we asked another day if all the other rooms had the same the front desk lady answer no this is the only one that has a blocked view. Why we were given this room as the hotel was 98% empty? Does the customer experience not come first here? (As a Platinum card member I could have booked a cheaper room and have a free lounge with breakfast on top instead of booking a suite but never mind) The suite came with access to the club lounge. The lounge was closed and we were told to sit here at the Reception/ Check-in area where you can have some drinks. (WOW??) It did not make me feel special at all.  Drinks came with some snacks but they were not as expected. Snacks at the 7-11 were better. Mirco waved soft snacks that were supposed the be crispy. The lady was lovely and apologised. My partner felt sorry for her as she was embarrassed serving us these snacks. We booked for 2 nights, the next day we did not want to used the ""club lounge""anymore as we were quite happy to pay for our wines and food anywhere else. Breakfast was a la carte with baby size plates clearly not enough. I asked for some bread items but the came so later that we did not touch them. Banyan Tree if you give something then please give something nice and of good quality or nothing at all! Tip for your GM: Please visit the JW Marriott (close to you) and see what can be possible in these times. You will be amazed. Happy staff and happy guests in a busy breakfast lounge every day and a good working Club lounge. If you thing you can do it please do so otherwise leave it. Your customers will not be impressed with what you are offing now. (I am sure they all say that they do understand and so did we, but do not forget that we have a good choice of hotels to choose from!) I will not be coming back to this property!",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

69,3.0,"The hotel is set back of Sathon Tai road. Both BTS and MRT stations are located about 10-15 minutes walk away. Some convenience stores are located within few minutes of walking. Mr.Nueng from frontdesk provided a fast check-in process. Check-out was also smooth.My original purpose was to try their new Serenity Club Room, but it appears that they closed down some high floors during weekdays, so they put me in 2-bedroom suite which is located on lower floors instead. The suite was very spacious. It may be worth the upgrade, but it contradicts my original purpose.The suite was clean, but I spotted stain on carpet, sofa and chairs.Guest service was prompt and professional.Wi-Fi internet was extremely bad, weak signal, and was not stable throughout my stay. It was able to get only 1-6 Mbps in some parts of the room. This should not happens in a 5-star hotel. They should replace their ancient wireless access point (802.11g) to newer model and install more of them for better coverage.TVs in my suite were Smart TV, but I could not make use of any smart feature from them. The hotel should make a great improvement on their Wi-Fi and network, and put TVs onto the network, so that guests can enjoy own's content from their devices.Moon bar on the rooftop was provided good drinks with stunning view of Bangkok and attentive service.Overall it was a nice hotel with clean room, good amenities and great service, but the Wi-Fi was awful.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Thank you to the front desk - you gave us a lifelong everlasting memory. Our stay was relatively short so we couldn't sample all the hotel has to offer (and didn't want to leave our delightful room) however we did take a trip to the rooftop Moon Bar and it really is a 'must do' as the views and the atmosphere were truly amazing.  It would be difficult to find fault with any aspect of our stay, so suffice to say we were extremely impressed with the staff, the room, the location and definitely the rooftop Moon Bar.

He gave us the most exciting recommendations for restaurant (that cater towards our very specific needs)as well as sights to visit that is off the beaten path, which in my opinion shows that his knowledge is very in-depth, personal and not taken out of your run of the mill guide book.

Hotel is brand new, which is amazing in itself, so fresh, no smells in the room, and finally I found a hotel with a good air conditioning system in the room that is not freezing and not loud, it is quiet and does exactly what you want it to do. Nice bathroom too, and everything just works perfectly.The best part of the stay were the staff though, some of the friendliest and most attentive I ever met. Especially the Korean lady at reception, Ester. She remembered my name from day one and even when I came back after a few months with no booking, just a walk in, she remembered my name. Impressive, she should get a raise :)Anyway, everything else was great too, facilities and the pool are fantastic. This is definitely my favorite hotel in Bkk now within it’s price range at least.Oh and the location is the best. Walk to Emporium is 5min",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

Bed linen is also very new.- Overall cleanliness is also good.- Staffs are friendly and hospitable.- Rooftop bar is quite nice with good vibes.- Full facilities in room are setup well.- Swimming pool is nice and big.- Breakfast is satisfying.- Lobby area is beautiful decorated.- There are various choices of cake which look so tasty.- Hotel is located in a walkable range to the train stations or department stores.Cons.- Unfortunately, the hotel just opened and encounters pandemic situation. So, some facilities look not fully function.- Except the headboard in guestroom which is beautiful, overall design of room is too simple. (personally)- There is a bad smell from the drain from toilet in many areas of the hotel e.g. in guest room, lobby restroom.- Breakfast choices are limited.- As the bed linen is very new, the blanket is not so soft and fluffy yet. - Even though the room facing BTS Asoke offers a good city view, on the contrary, room on BTS Promphong side doesn't not offer quite beautiful view.- There is a bit confusion to connect from car park to lobby since the sign is not so clear.**Special thanks to K.Phan (Concierge) for his assistance on our several luggages and stuff although we came to check in at very late night.**",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

25,5.0,"Great stay with some teething issues but still a great hotel. These are purely comments which i hope will help as i experienced. Arrival: Arrived in a limousine from The Peninsula and had to wait for over 5 minutes as the car infront was trying to Valet and blocking the entrance but the driver was in a full flow conversation with the bell boy who didnt even acknowledge our car trying to arrive.  Eventually a small wave.  Bell Boys and Management ALWAYS very friendly when entering or leaving the hotel during my stay. Reception great welcome and very friendly. I had two consecutive bookings to make things more complicated. Great explanation of the hotel facilities too. Lovely. Bedroom fabulously looking but there is NO plug socket for a hairdryer near to a mirror. Had to use the socket under the TV but no mirror. Bathroom only have shaver sockets. TV channels are limited but i guess these will improve when the international market returns (comparing to other 5* in Bangkok)Restaurants not fully operational which is perfectly acceptable especially during this time.  Had dinner at Tuxedo where you could enjoy the all day dining restaurant menus too:1. Arrived and sat just behind the pillar and was IGNORED for over 10 minutes. One guy inside the window kitchen wearing black (and just chatting to the kitchen staff who were busy cleaning surfaces) was trying to get the attention of a restaurant staff but no joy.  I stood up to leave and finally a waiter came over and put down the menus. He spoke virtually NO english at all (similar to the waiter at the poolside again in black how could only point to the menus). 2. Gave my order of a starter and main course. Ended up pointing to the dishes as he could not understand. 3. Order came 15 minutes later but both starter and main course ALL together and water bottle arrived at the same time!4. The main course was WRONG.  The waiter didnt understand and a lady (excellent English speaker) who was very friendly came over showed me the menu and i  pointed to the two dishes i had ordered. She apologised and was VERY professional. She came back with an orange cake and 'very sorry'. So i had had my started by this time and then had the cake.5. Finished and asked for the bill, the CORRECT main course then arrived!!  Both dishes were very good and well presented.Cooling Tower:1. WOW!! Top class. 2. Fabulous - so fabulous that could not get a table on the first night. (hence me having dinner at Tuxedo)3. Second night had dinner there. Planned to be there one hour but ended up staying until the DJ Blackie finished! A bottle or more of wine and a few dishes  later...4. Fabulous mixes with a fabulous blend of golden oldies and up to date music and great tempo. Great vibes.5. Tangmo and Max - a credit to your team. The two hostesses extremely elegant and very well spoken and a delight! Overall the hotel is fabulous; the price we paid was excellent but competition is tough in Bangkok so it will be interesting to see the future prices once (we hope) covid is a thing of the past.Will be back (if you will let me!) during these coming months.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

Service 5/5Rooms 5/5Location 5/5We came straight from the hospital and unknowingly made a good decision choosing this hotel, Had to wait for stitches to come off before going home.Hotel is great, everything is fantastic. Whether it is the reception or clean rooms or house keeping, they are all extremely caring and welcoming. What made us surprise was that everyone in the hotel knew we came from the hospital and were really nice. Room service asked us if we needed to avoid or order specific food in our case. The housekeeping took time to clean our room thoroughly. Khun Lek in the house keeping is very prompt and quick. She has the potential to work twice as others and very quick. The day she comes, we know room cleaning would only take minutes. Even the pool section offered us juices in happy hour which usually you don't. Also Croissant on the ground floor restaurant is too good. We had the chance to meet the lady cheff and say Thank You.They even celebrated our anniversary and Birthday with Beautiful flowers and a hand written card from everyone. Very touching. We love everyone from the bell boy to the housekeeping.Our Dear Khun Pepe, Thank you for arranging those beautiful flowers. This whole year has been affected by covid and what you did for us has been the most memorable moment this year. We enjoyed talking to you everyday until someone had to come and steal you away Dear Khun Palm, You are a lovely person. Very polite and humble.

51,5.0,"To the point, we very much enjoyed our staycation here. The new hotel and their exceptional staff deserve a five star recommendation. From our well designed/functional hotel room to their multiple restaurant dining venues (we dined at three of them) including Wah Lok (marvelous dimsum), the rooftop Cooling Tower, and the Plate (for a lovely breakfast), we give them ALL and their staff a thumbs up. We loved the live DJ vibes at the rooftop bar.  The workout room is large and well equipped. The very large/long salt-water pool is exceptional. But foremost, as prior reviewers have shared, what stood out most were the earnest service providers from time of arrival to time of departure and at each of the dining venues (including the pool staff too). There were management/staff introductions on arrival, follow-ups during our stay, and again kind follow-ups on our departure (not just to see how we were doing but also to solicit any feedback on improvements).  We can't let this review end without sharing our recognition and hats off to Khun Palm, Khun Boram, Khun Esther, Khun Jenny and Khun Dy ... and to a very endearing bespetacled young man at the pool who so enthusiastically shared helpful insights on the available pool services.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

Right from arrival on check in the staff were superb - they went above and beyond to help with whatever we needed. The room was spotless with nice touches like automatic curtains over our big panoramic window, a Japanese style toilet and Nespresso machine. The bed was very comfortable with very high quality linen and the internet was lightening fast.Only a couple of criticisms from us - the air con was so cold, even set at 26 degrees (we live in Thailand), we were freezing and had to have it turned off most of the time! There wasn't a socket in the bathroom for hair dryers (only for shavers which normal plugs don't fit into) so makes it difficult for ladies to do their hair as there's no other sockets near to a mirror. The universal sockets next to the bed were very stiff, perhaps because they were new, but our 3 pin UK plugs didn't fully fit into them. These are minor criticisms thought, it's an outstanding hotelThe swimming pool is fabulous and huge, the best we have seen in Bangkok. Excellent happy hour and very attentive staff. The gym (although we didn't use it) is very well equipped. Plate restaurant with the set menu lunch was really good value and the food was excellent - we ate here twice.

Best I have stayed at in downtown Sukhumvit. Breakfast is good wonderful coffee, shame everything is wrapped in plastic but I sure this is due to covid restrictions. One area they should look at its getting rid of the plastic water bottles in the rooms and have glass bottles. Also remove the plastic bottles in the showers and baths.Or have refill stations for water. I believe this is now our favourite downtown place to stay now.Thanks to You, Whan, Esther, Nuam and Dy for making it a great stay.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

74,5.0,"We stayed at the Carlton Hotel Bangkok for the 3rd time now. I actually asked my 3-year-old son where he wanted to go for the weekend. Usually, he likes trying new places, but this time he was very determined to go back to the Carlton Hotel.  This doesn't come to a surprise as the staff is great with kids. Especially Mrs Whan at the desk and Khun Win at the Tuxedo Restaurant. Those 2 really manage to be professional and are great with or son. They seem to understand that kids aren't just kids, but they want to be included in all experiences. They make our son feel welcome and feel included as a guest. We had the afternoon delight tea for lunch and were amazed by how delicious every component was. We usually don't eat sweets as we live a keto lifestyle, but we thought we'd give it a try and just taste everything. We ate the whole thing like savages :D it was extremely delicious. Those chefs really really know what they are doing.I also have to give special credits to Yu, Ester, Nhing, and again Whan as a team, as they noticed it was my birthday. They called us to invite us to the rooftop bar for a complimentary birthday drink. We were actually planning to eat out, but as that sounded very inviting we went up for drinks. The rooftop bar was so nice, we decided to stay for dinner and thank god we did! The food was amazing! We all slept like babies in the super comfortable beds. The rooms are designed more convenient than most hotel rooms in Thailand. They've put some thought in efficiency and practicality. The blinds block out all the light and close with a switch instead of manually. No more putting all the pillows you can find in the room to block out the light :) The only thing I'm missing is a plug near a mirror to blowdry and style my hair. That's probably the only thing they missed designing the rooms. Also, a small bin in the bathroom would be more convenient.  But other than those small details it's designed to perfection. The pool is very nice. I love the woodwork they used and the sunbeds are comfortable. The pool bar is great and again, the food is so good!!! There are too many 5 hotels with terrible kitchens. I'm happy that Carton Hotel realizes how important a good inhouse restaurant is! I could probably write a book about all the things I love about the hotel but short summary the pool, the restaurant, the facilities and above all the staff! The staff can make or break your experience and I think the staff of Carlton is well aware of that. Please keep up the good job and we will definitely come back often and be your best advocates.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

It is quite easily one of the best hotels I've stayed in.The rooms are airy, very tastefully decorated and equipped with a really excellent smart TV and home media system.

The bed itself was faultless.Every staff member I interacted with was pleasant, accommodating and smiling. In particular Namwhan, Yu and Esther all left an excellent lasting impression. I really felt like a VIP during my stay. The breakfast was served unlimited but a la carte, and everything was fresh and delicious. The coffee was excellent and the bacon was amongst the best I've been served in SE Asia.The fitness suite was sparkling, clean and very well-appointed, and the pool area is pleasant too. On my first night I also spent time at the Cooling Tower, the bar and restaurant on the top floor. Naturally the views were excellent, but I was also surprised to find the food was impressive too - a light and fresh spinach focaccia washed down with on-tap IPAs, recommended by yet more helpful and attentive staff.I cannot recommend the Carlton more highly.

Opened in 2020, the variety of rooms flagship promises a blend of style, serenity and comfort.And it delivers. Its magnificence is made clear from the second I enter the lobby. A sweeping & spacious floorplan; classic yet contemporary design features and, most resonant, a feeling of familial hospitality which competitors often struggle to achieve. Having arrived with city shrouded in grey, the dazzling interior design is a welcome sight, and thankfully, it’s in no short supply. As I’m escorted to my room by one of Carlton’s expertly-trained team members, I can’t help but notice that no stone has been left unturned and the attention to detail is remarkable. The use of light woods; marble tiling and high ceilings generates a refreshing airiness and palatial spaciousness. Locally crafted fabrics, furniture and art are tastefully displayed alongside modern décor and state-of-the-art appliances. No stuffiness here: a veritable feeling of ease and comfort abounds, giving the sense that these are spaces designed to be lived in and moved through.Undoubtedly one of the biggest drawcards to Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit is its extensive range of dining experiences.

19,5.0,"It was our first visit to MO bangkok. We got upgraded to the Mandarin room (as it was supposed to be our wedding day). The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. I find the bathroom layout a bit odd though, as the toilet is right next to the shower. The housekeeping service was impeccable, our room was always neat and clean. The butler service was a nice touch as well.Breakfast was wonderful. They offered a-la-carte menu only because of the pandemic, but the menu was quite substantial. Everything was tasty and good quality. The service was a bit slow, but I didn’t really mind.We dined at Ciao Terrazza on our first night. Advance reservation recommended if you want a table by the river. The food was, overall, tasty and of generous portion. The staff was super nice and comp us a cake to celebrate our special occasion.The other night at their other restaurant, the Verandah, I ordered the fish and chips but that was a let down. The fish was dry and the minted mushy pea was too toothpaste-like, in my opinion.Overall, we had a wonderful stay  at the MO and already looking forward to our future stay at the hotel.","Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok Hotel",5.0

The touch and feel was luxurious yet homely and relaxed, with the vibrant spot on the riverside makes it hard to beat by any hotels, new or old, in Bangkok. We dined at the Varendah and the iconic Author’s lounge, and the food, service, and ambience was flawless. Breakfast by the river was of top notch quality with cosy setting by the riverside.

However, my recent stay at the MO Bangkok was a revelation on what true luxury is.  It’s not just the wonderful designs and amazing facilities,  that’s expected now days, rather it’s  the people and intrinsic ‘feeling’ or ‘vibe’ that a great hotel projects if it’s to be considered a true luxury hotel. The MO Bangkok is welcoming and relaxing. You feel at home and at ease immediately. It gives you a sense of place something many ‘shiny’ new hotels lack.

Every aspect of the hotel is top notch, in addition to  the luxuriously appointed, breathtakingly beautiful Chao Praya Suite in the Garden Wing, what stood out the most for me was the flawless service from everyone I encountered: receptionist, butler, pool attendants, spa therapists etc etc. Special shout out to Tippie (Front Office Manager) and Pao from the pool - their attentiveness and personal warmth made this memorable 1-night ‘trial stay’ feel like I had been a loyal returning guest. On the note, they can rest assured that I will be one in the years to come.PS Sipping wine in The Bamboo Bar and listening to a particularly soulful rendition of Julie London’s Cry Me A River was one of the highlights of 2020...

32,2.0,"After having lived overseas the past several years, I was very much looking forward to coming back to the warmth of Thai hospitality, and without doubt this Grande Dame is the place to be - however I was utterly disappointed. Given the current circumstances, domestic staycation is indeed the new normal. Highly competitive packages are being aggressively promoted across all channels. I have called the hotel with regards to my upcoming stay I bought via MegaTix, the experience I have encountered with the reservations agent as the first touchpoint was a total failure which sadly marred my impression of this iconic hotel. He was rather adamant to proceed with the booking that he insisted for an email correspondence. I spent over 10 minutes trying to have a comprehensible conversation in order to confirm my booking (quoting my booking reference etc) then finally managed to confirm the dates. And that was the end of the call, with no further questions asked, no pre-arrival arrangements was discussed, no sense of courtesy, nothing was welcoming. During the point of conversation I even had to ask if I could speak to a different agent, but to no avail. I was advised there will be a follow up call the next day, until then no calls was received. Understandably, the hotel may be inundated with enquiries, and perhaps having to cope with the new guest demographics particularly at this time of the year is also a new normal to them. Or perhaps the legendary standards of service is not applicable to special promo guests. My advice is that you cannot rest on your laurels, we had far better services rendered by your riverside neighbours - all ambitious to surpass their guests expectation.

So, as long as MO BKK being my favorite, there were some let downs in hotel services. The first one, my butler call in my room was not working. The second one, which I considered most needed for improvement, bath’s amenities. We were given toothpaste tablets, which were quite difficult and not pleasant to use. And they didnt provide us some extra tabs, in case of losing ones. Also, the bath amenities were totally uncomparable to other 5 starred hotels in Bangkok. MO BKK amenities looks cheap and brandless and didnt fit with what I paid for. However, the rest of my stay was a bless. Room was nice and very well decored. Bathroom was nice. Pool area and pool staffs were the best with their attentiveness. Bubble breakfast was also brilliant.","Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok Hotel",5.0

37,5.0,"This hotel is known for their legendary service but it was one of the oldest hotel in the city. It’s the reason that I never wanted to stay here. Now the hotel was renovated and it’s in the best condition and  with the renowned service. It’s the only hotel that you want to stay in Bangkok. We stayed during weekdays and got upgraded to a suite with a butler. For hygiene reason the room was sealed after it was throughly cleaned and no one allowed in the room except for the checked-in guests. The fruits basket was changed daily and the room got back to the checked-in stage after every maid service, even on the last day of the stay. It was incredible.The food was great and their high tea is the best but if you want some changes, the Icon Siam is just a short boat ride from the hotel and free of charge. The spa was top notch, only downside is you have to get up stairs to the spa and more stairs to the treatment rooms. Not quite senior friendly but you can tell them your conditions in advance and they’ll try their best to accommodate you.

42,5.0,"Stayed here for a week, just before the pandemic turned everything upside down. I wish I could go back...I was so excited to stay here, having heard so much about the property, and also being a fan of the sister hotel in Hong Kong. It did not disappoint, and it's up there with my best and most memorable hotel stays. Had a deluxe premier room in the river wing, which I believe is their entry category room. The room was beautiful, newly refurbished, very spacious, comfortable, and had a real sense of place - not an anonymous and bland room which could be anywhere in the world. Had a hotel pick up from the airport, and arrived in the morning to see breakfast had already been placed in the room - a nice touch. Everything about the room was great - lovely bathroom, Japanese loo, deep soaking tub, and a good view of the river, over to the ICONSIAM development on the other side. The best thing about the hotel was the service. I don't know what their staff: guest ratio is, but assume pretty high. Despite the fact the hotel is fairly large, the staff still, somehow, managed to make you feel special. It's only small things, like remembering your name, but it all adds to this overwhelming feeling of comfort, safety, and security. And the idea that as a guest, you are being cosseted and looked after so very well. Bangkok is a pretty busy and crazy city, the hotel feels like an oasis of calm in all this. F&B - tried quite a few of the restaurants. Breakfast on the terrace - lovely, and so nice to see all the comings and goings along the river. My only suggestion would be for the hotel to add a bit more variety in the breakfast dishes offered, perhaps? Lunch in Lord Jim's - a very comprehensive buffet. Dinner there one evening was great, too. Dinner in the Thai restaurant over the river - Sala Rim Naam - this was pretty good - would recommend sitting outside if possible. And then the Italian restaurant, also outside - was amazing. I loved their vitello tonnato..Had a dinner in China House - would recommend trying to get one of the booths for two, if you can. Had a couple of treatments in both spas - a traditional Thai (clothed) massage in the main spa over the river, and also a Bastien treatment in the mini spa on the main side of the hotel. Both treatments were superb, and the therapists great, especially Syrine in the mini spa. The gym is on the same side of the river as the main spa - bear in mind it takes a bit longer to get there and back if you're planning a workout before starting your day, as you need to wait a tiny bit for the boat. Fairly well equipped for a hotel gym, and again, very attentive and thoughtful service. Managed to spend an afternoon by the pool one day - lovely. The pool food menu was pretty standard - club sandwich and fries etc - but did the trick. Not too much else to say, except this place really does deserve its reputation as one of the best hotels in the world. It is beautifully appointed, has a true sense of place, and you have the feeling that staff are proud to work there. Rooms and facilities are very well-maintained, and service procedures are highly polished (one of my favourites being how the floor butlers place tiny matchsticks by doors so they can see who has been in and out and they can refresh rooms accordingly). I'm glad I was able to stay there, and would go back in a heartbeat. Thoroughly recommended, and very memorable.","Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok Hotel",5.0

Yes, I know ""it's not just a stay, it's an experience"" is an overused PR cliche, and to be honest I was a bit skeptical myself at the hype associated with this hotel. But it turns out the reputation is indeed well deserved. In my stay, I've visited Lord Jim, Bamboo Bar, The Verandah, the Oriental Spa, and the afternoon tea at Author's Lounge. All of them are quality stuff worth the splurge, and the legendary service people keep talking about is indeed legendary. Not to mention the floor butler, the front desk people, the housekeepers, portmen, pier guys, etc. everyone is very attentive and helpful. ""Kob"" the barman at Bamboo Bar even made me a new cocktail just for my taste.

Check in inside the room  is very comfortable: looking to the river you are already relaxed.

52,5.0,"I have never been blown away by such attentive and dedicated service at any hotels, and the Mandarin Oriental truly surprises me at every moment over my two-night stay here. Initially, I thought these special moments were placed as I was celebrating a special occasion but over the stay, I realized that this MO is truly exceptional in executing the best hotel experience for its guests.The history of this property is well known, so I’m not going into any of that detail. Rather, what I want to focus on here are both the service as well as the comfort and decor of the rooms in the main tower after its renovation.First, let’s talk about the post-renovation room. I was given the room that overlooks the French Embassy with an amazing view after River and the gorgeous interior of the room is absolutely stunning against the dramatic view outside the room. The new interior gives a feeling of being in a wooden Thai townhouse, with it’s white wooden panels and airy interior. Modern touches include light switches that are built into the bed side console table that faces your bed, so one never has to reach to control lighting switches on the wall. There are inbuilt lighting scenes, and thoughtful touches also include a MO-logoed wireless charger for your phone, and 2 usb plugs with a universal power port on each side of the bed. There is also a Bose bluetooth speaker.The bed is amazing and cocoons around you, and the pillows are surprisingly firm to give side sleepers support despite being fluffily soft. I usually have to ask for a latex or memory foam pillow but these pillows here work perfectly for me. There is also a very nice long curved lounge chair with a decent size coffee table where In-room dining can be set up. The placement of the lounge chair also allows you to look out into the view. The room also comes equipped with a Nespresso machine and a porcelain kettle pot. Is there a Oso employee champagne flutes should you decide to pop open the bother of Roederer in the fridge. The bathroom just got slight upgrading works as the tiles still looks similar to the past. nonetheless, a Japanese bidet is installed and there is a separate shower stand with amazing rain shower head as well as a hand-held faucet. A huge bathtub is beside the double vanity sink, and toiletries now comes in aluminum bottles that the hotel recycles to create prosthetic limbs for community.     Now let’s get to the exceptional service but staff. Hotel staff working at the pool where are amazing and I have never seen such great service at any poolside at any hotels in my life before. Housekeeping and the butler assigned to your room also do an amazing job. The service here is not intruding but yet always ever omni-present. Every time I’m back to my room after a meal , from the pool or the spa, the bed and bathroom are always made up impeccably neat and everything put at the right places. And it is this level of service that really blew me away. This is definitely THE hotel to be when you are in bangkok. ","Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok Hotel",5.0

My youngest son was running to pick up the balls and fell over, bleeding horribly. So I carried my son into the fitness centre. The lady staff in there was although helpful. I could sense that she was extremely unwilling and unenthusiastic when she found out that we were not staying guests. It was overall a very unpleasant experience given that this is a six star hotel. I completely understand that we were not guests staying at the hotel but we were guests at the restaurant and a simple gesture of kindness could only go so far. At any other hotels, the staff would be more than willing to help and show much more enthusiasm when a child was carried inside the club bleeding. Extremely disappointed.

Sadly we were engaged with other wonderful things in the hotel and we totally forgot to touch anything in the mini-bar. Breakfast was wonderful. We had dinner at the Verandah both evenings.Flawless.The pool was very nice. The staffs were attentive and also gave my daughters choices of the swimming floaties (that I forgot to bring from home). Khun Piyanuch from Front Office was kind enough to gave my kid a chocolate pop at the pool! My daughter was very happy. Truly a legendary. Absolutely nothing failed us. Kudos to all staffs for being so professional. Will definitely come back again. ","Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok Hotel",5.0

The stay from start to finish was superb, and all the staff from management to regular employees could not have done more to make our stay so enjoyable.The hotel has had a tough time with the very lengthy renovations, I never really saw the need for such extensive work, but the results speak for themselves.

69,5.0,"Our family with 2 young kids decided to celebrate Thai Mother’s Day at the Chao Phraya Suite for a night. It was costly, but it was worth the once-in-a-lifetime experience. We got the Staycation package which allowed us to have early check-in and very late check-out the following day.Even during this Covid-19 situation, we felt safe as the hotel had all the measures in placed. The entrance to the suite had a sticker sealed on it saying, “cleaned and sealed for your protection”. According to the butler, the rooms would be cleaned and sprayed with alcohol as a preventive measure and then sealed. The room would then be left unoccupied for at least a day.The Chao Phraya Suite is locates in a private building above the Author’s Lounge. The suite has 2 floors loft-layout with a large floor-to-ceiling views of the Chao Phraya River. The bedroom and bathroom are on the upper floor while the dining table, living room, and mini kitchen are on the lower level. It also had a full-size fridge.Part of the entertainment was the complimentary shuttle boat going to ICON Siam just across the river. The kids love the boat ride. The shuttle departs every 30 minutes.The breakfast was nice but it was not a buffet-style during this Covid period. Guests were to order from the staffs.There were 2 swimming pools, one for smaller kids and one for bigger kids and adults. The large pool was about 25 meters in length.Overall, we would definitely recommend this hotel. It’s 5-star or 6-star rating never fails to impress you.

99,4.0,"Mandarin Oriental Bangkok is arguably the most luxurious hotel in the city.  They closed for a few months during covid but we had a stay when they reopened.  It is an old historical property which was recently renovated and it clearly fits the mold for “old luxury”, in sharp contrast with the recent constructions in Bangkok such as Waldorf Astoria and Park Hyatt which are more modern in style.  MO is best for people who highly value personalized service – it is truly world class.  The drawback of MO would be mostly for elite guests of loyalty programs from big hotel chains who care about having lots of space in their room, because many hotels in Bangkok are generous with suite upgrades which is an aspect not found at MO.For someone going on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Bangkok, I would recommend a hotel by the river, and MO is in an ideal quiet spot right on the water and on the more convenient side of the river as well.  They have a shuttle boat that can take guests to the luxury shopping mall Icon Siam or to other destinations upon request.I booked the entry level Deluxe Premier room and was upgraded one room category to the Chao Praya room.  The room was very charming, colonial style, built to a high standard and was very comfortable including strong central air conditioning.  The room had a seal on the entrance door to certify that it had been sanitized to hospital standards.  The hotel is more than 100 years old but because of the thorough renovation the technology features of luxury hotels are not missing, for example the electric blinds and curtains.  The living room had floor to ceiling windows which are not commonly found in older hotels, which was perfect to enjoy the river views.  The living room also had a high ceiling due to the entrance door of the room being on a split level higher.  Unfortunately the ceiling in the bedroom and bathroom was much lower which was one aspect betraying the age of the building.  Some new hotels such as Waldorf Astoria Bangkok has issues with sound proofing with the windows on the busy street in front, but at MO the issue was more about sound proofing of the floor/ceiling above where we could hear people walk and it could disturb our sleep on occasion.While the overall build quality at MO was higher than Park Hyatt and Waldorf Astoria where for some aspects they cut corners, on the flip side at MO I thought the room was a bit small at 34 sq meters compared to PH 48 sq meters and WA 50 sq meters, let alone the fact that chain hotels liberally upgrade elites to suites which further compounds the difference.  In our room at MO, the living room did not feel cramped but the bathroom was functional but small and only had a single vanity.  Nonetheless I liked the window in the toilet enclosure for some natural light with frosted glass with wood blinds for privacy. The breakfast venue in the Verandah restaurant on the terrace outside immediately next to the river is hard to beat.  However the a la carte menu was disappointing for a hotel of this caliber and I much preferred the luxury choices at 137 Pillars than at MO which did not have anything that would make you go “wow”; the Japanese set might be the more interesting choice but it was not included in the breakfast benefit which can come across as a bit stingy.  In fairness, the food presentation was excellent and the prawns and avocado on toast was delicious; they also accepted when I asked if they could prepare something off the menu.  They brought up fried rice and stir-fried veggies which were good but fairly standard for Bangkok.  By comparison, at 137P the menu includes great choices such as crab meat omelets, squid salad, wagyu steak, free flow Cava, and a similar Japanese set which 137P does not exclude.  I have not been to Waldorf Astoria Bangkok since covid because the hotel has not reopened yet, but the breakfast buffet there was also a couple of notches better than the current offerings at MO, for example the choice of fruits is stellar at WA with many berries, a daily rotation of hot dishes such as fried rice with scallops, many kinds of curries, thick pieces of sea bass, truffle eggs with caviar, etc.  So overall while I liked the restaurant itself at MO, the menu left to be desired and would be something easy to improve.Service was excellent even as a first-time guests at this property.  Immediately upon arrival they offered to clean our suitcases; it set the tone for the service we would receive during our stay.  I realize that the hotel was far from full so it might have been easier to keep track of who in-house guests were, but even at the beginning of our stay if we met one staff on the ground floor near the elevator she would escort us to our room because she knew what room we had without us having to say anything.  One time we went near reception, staff knew right away that we had an appointment at the spa and they led us to the right place.  We had a late flight out of Bangkok and the hotel extended 8pm check-out and once we arrived at the hotel they even made it 9pm check-out which is about as generous as it gets.  The way we were treated was fantastic throughout and I can only imagine how it is for regulars at this property.  We had great service at other luxury hotels in Bangkok before, but MO stands tall in that regard and it is clearly the number one strength of this hotel.  The spa is not in the main hotel building but it is rather on the other side of the river so you need to take the shuttle boat to go there.  I personally did not mind in fact the boat ride is pleasant and enjoyable with comfortable seating.  It should not come as a surprise given my comments about the service that I thought the spa at MO was great as well, even compared to other top destinations in the world with great spas such as the Maldives or Bora Bora.The Bamboo Bar is popular and quite famous, attracting many people who are not guests of the hotel.  They have live performers every day and a good choice of cocktails.  Even for people not staying at MO, I think it’s worth the detour for the premium experience.Overall we had a nice stay and I could not recommend this hotel enough especially for people who care most about service.  However they should up their game with the breakfast offerings to match with the other luxury aspects of the hotel.  Regarding the hardware it’s an older hotel which gives a feeling of “old luxury”, but it also comes with some drawbacks such as room size and soundproofing.  For someone without elite status at any hotel chain, MO is a solid choice, but for MO to compete with the generous suite upgrades elite guests can receive at St.Regis, Park Hyatt, Waldorf Astoria, or the all-suites property 137 Pillars then if having a lot of space is a priority, then in that case MO will have a more difficult time to compete.","Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok Hotel",5.0

Additionally, TRUST ME and get a Traditional Thai massage while you are there.  It was the best massage I've ever gotten and the price was great.  I got it on our last night and tried to schedule another one for the morning before I left, but they were booked up.  Honestly, I am tempted to go back to Thailand just for a massage at this hotel.  The restaurant Suan Bua at the hotel was really subpar.  We were the first people there when it opened, and it still took us over 2 hours to eat and get our check.  We asked for our check and a dessert to go simultaneously, and it took 30 minutes (we timed it) to get both.  We were falling asleep at the table and so ready to go back to our room!The pool is beautiful but the hot tub was broken.  We were excited to go sit in the hot tub after a long day, but it was cold when we got down there!We went up to the rooftop restaurant (which is a French bistro), but it wasn't anything special so we didn't eat up there.

I had 2 separate bookings and requested to maintain in the same room. I understand it is subjected to availability but the way Hsiao-Min rejected me without even checking. This frustrates me. She even squinted at Kotchaporn with an irritated and agitated look. Is this the kind of service you put at the front desk to represent your Hotel? More importantly, is this the kind of hospitality Thailand offers? The land of smiles? On the other hand, Naruth, Kotchaporn and the morning Trainee was very friendly and professional.The pillow quality is inconsistent.

The hotel offers shuttle buses to the latter two though I have not used them.But I had a bad experience asking the hotel staff to get me a taxi. I showed the staff my destination clearly on a google map. But the taxi driver tried to take me to a different place farther away.

50,5.0,Stayed here with my wife as part of a four centre trip to Thailand. Primary reason for visit was a friend’s traditional Thai wedding in Bangkok and chose this hotel for its proximity to the wedding venue. Can not fault the hotel facilities or the staff who were always friendly and helpful. Not necessarily convenient for the major tourist attractions and worth bearing in mind that for large parts of the day the traffic will double the time for most taxi journeys. Use the Grab app and book a car rather than a taxi as it is fixed price. Breakfast is amazing. Also ate at the international buffet one evening with the choice being superb and catering for all tastes. Hotel is attached to the huge central plaza shopping centre with lots of food choices. For me another plus was the close proximity of two parks for running in. Recommended ,Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok Hotel,4.5

My only complaint with this hotel is the lifts, the lifts worked fine, BUT every time one of the lifts was called / arrived it let off a loud ""bing bong"" noise to announce its arrival. Not a problem during the day but all through the night intensely annoying. Bearing in mind that this hotel is used as an airport hotel, including cabin crew staying here, there are guests coming and going through the day and night. Management really need to go and spend some time sitting in a room near to the lifts and see how frequent and loud that ""bing bong"" is, why does it need to be that loud? Why cant it be silenced through the night? Loved that this hotel is connected to a shopping mall, made going out for a meal so easy and safe, would definitely stay here again if I return to Bangkok.",Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok Hotel,4.5

The hotel is linked to the BTS and Subway Station through a shopping center and the location is great. Almost anything you need is a stones throw away including the famous chatuchak weekend market. I will certainly consider this hotel on my next trip to Bangkok.,Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok Hotel,4.5
