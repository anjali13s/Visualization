However, it didn’t end there. I lost my mobile phone and everyone including the kind security checked the cctv helped me! I finally managed to retrieve my cell phone!I cannot Thank enough every staffs here in this Hotel for their patience, kindness and impeccable services from the Heart! They have even baked a chocolate birthday cake for my son’s birthday! My gratitude towards them cannot express with words alone! They have certainly taken the 5 Stars services from the Heart to a whole new different level! They can indeed stand toe to toe at any day, any time with any International 5 Stars Hospitality!

2,5.0,"== People ==This is my 5th Marriott hotels in Bangkok, which is great for the overall services.I have great impression while the arrival, bell boy is proactive, and front desk guided me to the R Bar for check in (Club Lounge is temporarily closed for renovation). The club team is very attentive, K Ploy gave us very warm welcoming and the nice room arrangement. The whole process is very smooth. I would like to thanks for the Club Manger K One and her team, they take care of the club guest well, and handled the incident with prompt action and properly.== Room ==Thanks to the Club team arrangement, we stay at a nice Studio Suite this time. The room with high ceiling, thus even it a bit aged, you still fell very specious. The bathroom is see through and with a big window, also feel comfortable while using the it.Housing keeping team did a great job to give us comfy room, the most touched thing is they provided the nice toothpaste for our long stay when we told them we don’t want to waste the toothbrush by just using the toothpaste attached. Only concern is the sofa by side of the window, the surface may need some retouch, suggest to make it wider while the renovation, then it can be a great day bed in the room. == Facility ==Great thing is the fitness open 24hours, good for me to do the cardio in the early morning. Swimming pool looks nice, but didn’t have chance to use this time.== F&B==One of the best breakfasts of the Marriott hotels in Bangkok, admire the wide variety of the food, as well as the pastry corner, almond and chocolate croissant are great, but egg stations’ quality seems not consistent.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
3,3.0,You gotta love the location of the hotel-in the middle of everywhere in BKK. Nice and comfy bed. The amenities are not bad but not my favourite-too faminine. Super slow food at R Bar. The aircon in male’s locker room definitely needs to be fixed/deep cleaned. ,Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
4,5.0,Great services as always. Breakfast especially cheese omelette by Chef Roong is the best. Khun June at Flavor always gives you morning smile. Service and Refreshment at the club lounge is quite good when not so crowded. Food and services at La Tavola and Feiya are great. Recommend for a short break. ,Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
5,5.0,"I felt excited every time to come back to stay at this hotel as its exceptional friendly and nice staff made me feel welcome and special. It was just like I was back to meet old friends. One of the most enjoyable time while staying here was during the relaxing times in the lounge to enjoy great food & beverage, while chit chatting to staff. Apart from Kwan, Ploy, Aey, Chacha, Kevin, Chef Jack whom I was familiar with, this time I also met Khun Wan, the club lounge manager. She was so active and attentive to guests’ request that I had no surprise why the lounge staff were impressive. Although I had no chance to meet Min, who was able to please you with, not only the standard alcohol drinks, but also some special drinks from her mixing skill, her lively and smiling faces when she handed in her specially mixed drinks with proud remained in my mind. She even said that she would keep practicing her drink mixing skill more and more in order to make her guests smile with happiness. What a nice lady!On the checking-out day, I always think to myself that ‘wait for me and I will come back soon’.This property is highly recommended for travelers who looks for great place to stay in the centre of Bangkok with full of fantastic staff who is prompt to offer the second-to-none quality of services.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

7,3.0,"It’s my first time staying at this hotel. So I had a little expectation before going.The hotel is easy access from BTS Chidlom station with convenience stores nearby. Walking distance to Central World and Siam Paragon. My friend and I stayed at Deluxe room with club benefits from Marriott’s. Unfortunately club lounge on a high floor was temporarily closed for renovations so we spent time at ground floor bar instead. Luckily we still had some snacks to enjoy. The bed size is perfect and soft. The wild clear window can see througc bathroom is good for staying alone and couples lol. But the room was a little bit old for the electric stuffs, no USB and still need to use ight switch. Staffs are friendly and helpful but there were a traffic during snacks time at ground floor. The staffs were lack and seats were limited while guests were many. Breakfast was good. Restaurant staffs were friendly. It’s good that they serve orange juice with shot of espresso, well adjustment. Unfortunately I didn’t had a chance to try other restaurants in a hotel.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

9,5.0,"The promotional rate during Covid-19 was almost nothing so we didn't expect much at all. However, it turned out to be one of the best workation experiences. The check-in lady, Khun Dew, kindly upgraded the room the next day when it became available. We were greeted by first name with big smile by most staffs everywhere in the hotel. Our special thanks go to Khun One, Khun Kwan, and Khun Kevin who were always there especially around the club lounge. Khun One is highly professional, she manages the club lounge effectively with friendly vibes, making guests feel very much like home. Breakfast is one of the best in town. Loved the signature egg benedict with curry sauce. Must try! The afternoon tea and canapes times (rather think of it as late lunch and dinner), were always of high quality and tasty and it includes alcohol too! We also used the gym situated on high floor with the view of Bangkok skyline. I particularly like the pool because it is temperature controlled with heater. Will definitely return.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

11,5.0,Just got one comp night and chose to stay at this property for first time. The impression is staffs especially K. Tiffy and K.Ice at the front. My booked room type was unavailable as per previous guest's occupancy  when i arrived at 4.30 pm on 7th of feb but they upgraded me to 1515 with spacious area inside. Room cleanliness was top notch and bed was spotless. Love it! There were several kind staffs in lobby area but i dont know their name. There will be a second time of my visiting for sure.,Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

14,3.0,"This is my first time at Renaissance Hotel, Bangkok. I stayed there for 2 nights on 22nd floor. The room faces Central Word department store. The location is very close to sky train. Very convenient. Room: The decoration is nice, particularly the glasses which neatly used. The bed is amazing is very pleasant. The desk is also nice. The television is good. There are many channels. The toilet is beautiful. There is also a bidet shower next to the toilet. The bathtub is big and beautiful. It’s really photogenic. The amenities are good, nice smell. I really like the body lotion. There is an iron in the room as well. Well-equipped. Comfortable.Food: Delicious. Wide range of choices. Good quality.Service: Bell boy, and front desk boy are good. Housemaid are friendly. They gave me a very good impression. Very polite.Lounge: I went to check in on 21st floor at club lounge with a female staff. She did not greet me as a Marriott member. From my experience, when I check in any Marriott hotel, they generally greeted me by welcoming me back again. So, when she did not greet me like that, I was surprise; but that is fine, maybe she forgot. When I informed her about my booking, she looked nervous. From my experience, she did not perform a professional gesture at the check in desk. I did not tell me which room I was about to stay. When she finished the check in procedure, she did not inform me as well. So actually, from my experience, I expected more. I think this check in experience was not professional and unimpressive, particularly when compare to another Marriott hotel which I have stayed.At the lounge, on the day that I visited, there was a lot of people. I waited for quite a long time to get food. So I did not go back on the next day, because eating somewhere else was more convenient.Overall: Everything good, except the lounge.  ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
15,5.0,"The only hotel I been to that has a heated pool in Bangkok. Why would you need a heated pool in tropical Bangkok one wonders? The fact is there are indeed short sporadic periods of cold spells from November to January. This period, it went as low as 15 Celsius in my car’s thermometer on some mornings. For tropical folks here, jumping into a swimming pool in the cool season will throw many into hypothermia. So, when the pool is heated to a balmy 29 Celsius (as seen on my Garmin), it was indeed pleasant. As I swam over the water circulation outlets, it was like encountering those heated volcanic vents in the deep cold sea. The pool here is open air, but indoors in the shades. Lately, there has been a wave of Covid in Bangkok, strict measures are back in place again. To get access to the pool, we had to make advance bookings. Each booking is limited to 30 minutes. During that half hour, we had the whole pool to ourselves. Although this sounded restrictive, which it is, the experience was exquisite. Especially when you have children that are like 60,000W loudspeakers generating white noise, you do not really have to be concern about it as there are no one else around that could feel irritated. I loved the pool. It was like our personal family bathtub, minus the soap and bubbles of course.  The room we had was a one-bedroom studio suite. There are 4 on the corners of the floor we were on. Our room has generous windows across 270 degrees and that extended into the bathroom where a standing tub stood. A sturdy wall desk next to the large flatscreen, it was space slightly tight for some work I had to do. Natural light irradiated throughout the room, and the view of the urban scape was splendid. As the skies dusk, the spectrum of sunset tones painted our room. A sofa along one side, that was where I lazed relaxed and sipped coffee while watching the afternoon skies. Right beside this corner, a traditional set of gongs erected vertically on a stand. That was where I made loud chimes that did no rhymes, and probably irritating the rooms adjacent. The sound insulation between our room and the next 1726 was rather disappointing. No staff policed the floors on this Saturday night. The next room sounded like they had 20 people compacted in there to make the best out of the weekend room thay paid for. They were yakking loud, there was high pitch witchy laughter and there was constant slamming of the door as people went in and out of the party room. That really devastated my sleep. Fortunately, my child was able to sleep through all these. I only managed to get some shut eye after 1 am.  The executive lounge is located on a high floor. During cocktail hours, the place was entirely filled. This season, everywhere in Bangkok, everyone is a privilege guest with lounge access. And so, this is where we all turned cocktail canapes hour into a dinner meal. I love the way Renaissance practiced Covid measures here. We were not allowed to self-serve at the buffet line. But with the house being full, we had to wait long for our orders to be taken and waited equally long for the staffs to bring our food from the line. Children were at the verge of throwing tantrums. There was salad, there was karaage chicken for the children. There was the delicious panang pork curry and traditional rice crackers with meat sauce topping (except they kept forgetting to bring me the meat sauce). And then there was more. We really did not need dinner after that. Breakfast was an enjoyable feast as well. Except they were trying to freeze us to death. My congee turned into ice block, my pancakes turned into flying saucers. My child was unusually quite due to low body temperature and returned to live when I gave her hot food. Just kidding…  but it was cold. Breakfast spread featured local morning delicacies you find in markets. Moo ping (BBQ pork on sticks) was excellently tender and tasty. It was accompanied by sticky rice. There was kai yang kao niao (BBQ chicken, again with sticky rice), and there was also the traditional soy milk with dough fritters. It was local through and though. Some like it this way, bring the market in clean without walking the alleyways. Other then local, there was sushi, really delicious dim sum and all the other western spreads. They even had pulled-pork sandwich. I have always been impressed by the wide range in a Marriott buffet, but here at Renaissance, it was equally impressive. It did get quite crowded as 9 am drew near, so be early or be queued on weekends. We ate and ate, we did not need to have lunch, for the next 3 days.    Renaissance is located away from the main road. Seven Eleven will be a short stroll under the walkway of a shopping complex that has got a good sports factory outlet. On the main road up the stairs to the elevated walkway, you can easily reach Central World, the BTS and everything else. Convenience and access to everything are just short walks away. Outdoor areas for chilling out is limited in this hotel. Down the lobby, there are some chairs by the driveway, but that is the smoking area. The other outdoor space one could spend some time lazed on a chair to read a book is where the swimming pool is. And then there is the roof top bar, which is for drinks in the night, and was closed because of Covid. Any conducive space to do some notebook related work? No, there is none if outdoor one seeks. So, our room will have to be the work room, but with noisy child my concentration collapsed. There is a meeting room where the executive lounge is, but I would prefer sitting outdoors on a cool morning. All in all, my stay was fulfilling and fantastic, except for the noisy night. What was most unique and what I loved most, the heated pool. This shall be my return destination in the cooler months of Bangkok. And there are still some last chances of cold spells in Jan 2021 for the personal bathtub experience.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

18,5.0,"Staying at the Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel for 5 consecutive nights, we had so many great experiences there. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Bangkok. There are plenty of shopping malls nearby such as the Central World; where my wife went for her figure skate practice almost everyday and the Gaysorn Village is less than 5-min walk. And, the hotel is connected to the BTS Chitlom station via the Maneeya building on the 3rd floor. There are not so many guests during our stay so the hotel's quite peaceful and private. The 25 meter city-view indoor pool is a must to try. The fitness center is fully equipped with treadmills machines, and free weights, very impressive. We would recommend the La Tavola italian restaurant for dinner, the Parma ham pizza and their signature Tiramisu are mouth watering. Also, the famous Feiya chinese restaurant is always the best in Bangkok. Please try Peking duck and Dim Sum for lunch. Furthermore, we loved the wagyu beef burger atthe R Bar, so very yummy. We got upgraded to the Renaissance Suite room which is huge, beautifully decorated, and the bed and pillows are very comfy. We enjoyed the large sized bathroom, bathub with million dollar view. All the staff gave us a very warm welcome and best service since check-in; from Bellperson to Front desk. Moreover, we'd like to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to Khun Cyndy, Khun Tuk, and Khun David for their kind assistance reserving and upgrading the room, and making sure that everything's alright for us during our 5-night stays at the hotel, especially the lovely yummy cake for us, we appreciate your thoughtfulness. They all surely have a top-notch service. We're looking forward to coming back to stay at the Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hoteagain.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
19,4.0,"Currently, the hotel offers some of the best deals in a town, so that’s why we are here. The room we stayed was nice, quite big, with a large and wonderful bathroom. We didn’t went for the club room in the first place but then we decided to go for the Happy Hour (just a little additional price) and I have to say it was beyond our expectation. The food was even better than some other hotel’s lounge in a normal situation but the drinks may be so-so, but hey for this kind of price and situation it’s the best. For the breakfast, it seemed like the breakfast is served in the lounge in weekdays. There was something I would say “limited” about the food lineup but the taste was good. Pool area was fine. The services were nice. ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Furthermore, with special promotions now being offered, there's no better time to spend a few days living in the lap of luxury.Renowned for its delectable cuisine, outstanding spa and vibrantly artistic decor, Renaissance Bangkok offers guests a choice of 11 different room and suite accommodations. From the plush Executive Suite to the standard Deluxe room, each is filled with world class amenities, stunning decor and outstanding furniture; the beds are super comfortable too.The lower floors of the hotel are primarily reserved for food, function and fun areas. R Bar, for example, is a wonderful place to hang out enjoying your favourite cocktail, an ice cold beer or a straight up Americano coffee. The lobby is an artist's dream with hidden motifs, flowery symbols and a grand glass stairway. Hidden behind doors is the car lift, which rumour has it can be reserved for private dinners!Also located here are fine dining restaurants La Tavola, Fei Ya and Flavors, which shares the floor with the amazingly high-tech ballroom. La Tavola is one of the city's top Italian restaurants, while Fei Ya without a doubt cooks up the best Cantonese food, including its amazing Peking Duck, outside Hong Kong. Flavors, on the other hand, serves a fabulous international breakfast and at weekends is home to probably the best Sunday Brunch.The upper floors are where guests can indulge in a little R & R, with Quan Spa providing a unique array of treatments, the welcoming lap pool and sun loungers (in fact the pool is indoors so no chance of sunburn), while the exclusive Club Lounge is an oasis of calm.With easy access to Bangkok’s skytrain system, guests can enjoy shopping, cultural or sightseeing tours across the entire city. The skytrain interconnects with the city's subway system as well as riverboat services along the Chao Phraya River. However, if you prefer to stay closer to the hotel, guests have half a dozen shopping malls within a one-kilometer radius.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Why?Lobby: Nice and welcoming atmosphere with fresh and beautiful scent. Room: A bit old but comfortable and well-equipped with necessary amenitiesFood: No bad-taste food or not fresh food to think of Club Lounge: Good View with privacy atmosphereEverything seems to be right here for our family, but the most impressive thing to us is the STAFF from Front Door, Concierge, Club Lounge, Restaurant, Housekeeping, Pool & Fitness etc. Everyone we met are very energetic with, from my feeling, genuine service-mind. They are well-trained, nice, cheerful and helpful.Although I cannot name everyone here, but there must be some staff who I would like to give special thanks and let them know that they are recognized by their service mind skills. Khun Kevin (Concierge Navigator): He always has a big smile on his face with his good memory about the hotel's return guests, especially what they like or don't like. This definitely makes us feel like coming back to our 2nd home to meet friends. He also has a remarkable ability to make us so tasty cocktails that we forgot to count how many drinks we have had. Chef Jack: I am sure he is one of the key persons who makes the hotel’s restaurants well-known for their tasty fine-dining and services. He is outstanding from the cloud in terms of making you become a special guest by offering special things through his culinary expertise. Front and Club Lounge staff: Khun Dew, Khun Nan, Khun David, Khun Tiffy, Khun Kwan, Khun Aeh, Khun Yo as well as Khun Cindy (RSVN) – you are all a legend of our hotel experiences.

29,5.0,"The Renaissance Hotel is in the center of Bangkok's shopping area, called Ratchaprasong.  The hotel is new, clean and has a refreshing look.  It is also close to BTS skytrain which passes by in front of the hotel.  We visited October 13-15 and as Titanium Elite was upgraded to a club suite.  When entering the lobby, you are greeted by a huge area, gift shop, bar and restaurant in addition to the front desk and comfortable sitting area with plants, flowers and water fountain.   Mention you are a club member and they will escort you to the club floor for check in.  If not, the front desk is staffed by friendly, cordial team members.  All the hotel staff we came in contact with from front desk, club lounge, security, housekeeping, etc. were helpful and attentive.  Our room was spacious with king bed, desk, sofa, easy chairs and a huge bathroom with walk in shower and all the amenities.  Bedding was immaculate and fresh.  The club lounge offered breakfast, tea time and cocktail and snacks, which were more than ample.  Staff were great.  Also in the hotel is an Italian Restaurant, (closed Mondays) and a Chinese restaurant, in addition to all day buffet style dining.  The fitness area offers a swimming pool which is open till late, as well as the gym also open till late.  No bakery on site.  Although Elite members get discounts on dining, during the special promotions with daily credits, they do not discount any further than the amount they are offering, so if 500 baht daily credit, you can use that at your discretion but they will not add on another 20-30 % discount.  Logical.  All the areas of the hotel we visited, were spotless.  It is wheelchair accessible with elevators and level areas throughout.

I thinkfine, everything sucks but we have our suite room to go! so we open up our room and we are shocked, It’s executive room which have the same size as normal.we no longer want to make complain or anything, It’s really a bad day, my kids want to swim so we go off swimming, the pool is great, probably the best thing in this hotel.and the we comeback and turn the aircon off as It’s cold for kids(which turn out to be a terrible action). after we are done we turn zircon on, put on our cloth and decided to go to sleep(around 10pm) but the problem is the aircon doesn’t even works, It’s very hot at the 20 degree, we can barely breath.we then called front desk to send mechanic up to fix it, he said everything is normal, normal? really?I asked him that can he swear that this is 20 degree, can he breath(I even left my sandle to hold the door open so I can let some air in) he speak sarcastically “do you want it to be colder, just say it” and ofcouse I want it to be colder, after an hour everything is fix(11pm) and we go to sleepfront desk call us at 11:30pm probably to ask if everything is fix yet but It’s 11:30pm and my children are sleeping so I hang up and took off the phone.in the morning we found letter saying that they are sorry for the air-con problem, no need to say sorry if you don’t mean it, I tear it up and throw away it trash.breakfast was fine but we made an order for some thai food but they forgot to make it and we have to keep asking for it.when we check out, me and my wife ask front desk to cancel all of our reservation, so this is our 1 night stay, if you are going to stay here, I wish you luck, may the force be with you",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

32,5.0,"I've been doing a several months of Work From Hotel, and this has my favorite place in Bangkok. The hotel has one of the best location with easy access to BTS Chidlom, and short walk from Siam / Ratchadamri. Easy access to thousands of restaurant options. The front desk, housekeeper, and bell staffs were very nice. As a titanium member, they tried their best to upgrade me to the studio suite. The room offers great layout, fresh and very well decorated. I’d say the room is on par with Intercontinental, and significantly better than the dated Hyatt Erawan / JW Marriott. The executive lounge offered an okay food and drinks selection, but could get a bit crowded over the weekend.One downside would be the small pool area, no poolside services, and lacking hot bath or jacuzzi (neither in the spa). In hotel dining is also a bit limited, with Fei Ya’s pecking duck being the only standout option.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for a stay in Bangkok.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

42,5.0,"We stayed her for 2 days before our return to New York.  Our Chief Navigator Amarin was so hospitable. We have stayed in other areas at Marriott properties. So he was very instrumental in explaining all the area to us. The Breakfast Buffet which we obtained as a package when we checked in was truly a treat. Again love the idea of ordering you egg/waffle/pancake options and instead of waiting for completion the Chef or runner brings it to your table.. A special shout out to Reena.(does she ever go home? Always pleasant and accomodating). She recommended a delicious restaurant NARA just steps from the hotel. Had we not had her expert guidance we would have missed this gem. I was fortunate to meet the Food and Beverage Director also. He was busy perusing the Breakfast flow and communicating with the Chef. So Mr.Winfried Sanders kudos for your guidance and intuitive outreach. (He actually went to every seated table and personally greeted each guest. Asked if there were anything else they would need. This to me being in the hospitality service industry myself would fit the bill of what Danny Meyer calls. ""Enlightened Hospitality""). I inquired if I could possibly take a Coffee American to go. And in 1 minute the coffee was delivered to my table. I look for every nuance of poor service when I travel. There was nothing I could find at this property with regards to that matter. And trust me I looked. To all the staff and housekeeping thank you. We will definitely be back again. ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Similar to other cities, Bangkok is also relatively quiet because of the virus. It just took us less than half an hour from airport to hotel, amazing.The moment we entered the hotel, we felt the hospitality. The check in was fast & we were served with a cold welcome drink.  The check in staff, named Bay & her working partner are both informative & helpful.This is my fourth visit to the hotel because of it’s convenient location ( very near to BTS & nearby shopping  malls), excellent breakfast & service. Maybe as there are not too many guests, we are also allowed to have late check out until 1600 hrs.Very enjoyable holiday, will definitely come again to this hotel.Vivian",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Spa was nice and good, since there’s good promotion now! Pool is indoor though, so it’s a little too cold for us! We had daily breakfast and I love the fresh fruit juice counter, but having to stay for 4 days straight, we got a little bored with the food option, so maybe the chef can have alternate day change of food menu? We also ordered room service and the pasta carbonara tasted really delicious.

55,5.0,"Just returned from Bangkok where I stayed at several places including a Hyatt, Four Points and Renaissance. All fine hotels but the Renaissance was, as always, fantastic. Starting with a smooth check in process and recognition of my Platinum status with a nice room upgrade. Khathy and Little (their nicknames) clearly explained that the Executive Lounge is under renovation and indicated where its services where being provided instead. My room was perfect as always with a very inviting bed and ample bathroom space. Super clean!After hitting the fitness room, headed to the Tavola where they would be serving evening canapés and drinks. Was helped in by Dew who is an outstanding hostess and indicated the temporary arrangements. The Tavola is the Italian restaurant which is also serving as Executive Lounge. Helping guests are the same staff as in the regular lounge making it an almost seamless transition. I have to recognize the gracious help provided in the lounge by Dew and Min, who have a great attitude doing their jobs. Min was fantastic about recommending canapés and providing my favorite drinks. Dew was great at making me del at ease in the new location.Overall I love this hotel, for its facilities, location and most importantly for the superb staff.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
56,5.0,"We visited for one night during our time in Bangkok to celebrate our anniversary. After some digging online, I was able to find an email address to send a request prior to arrival. My email was swiftly responded to by Miss Jidapha, an R Ambassador, and I felt assured that we would be well taken care of. I was particularly impressed with Aggie at the concierge desk. We had sent another email prior to arrival with a request for recommendations of a nice restaurant for our anniversary dinner. He made our reservation and when we went to the valet stand to request a cab, Aggie asked where we were going and immediately recognized us by our booking and greeted us by name. We saw him again the next morning and he asked how our dinner was. This was a great show of customer service and guest recognition, thank you Aggie! Based on the level of service we received from staff across the board, I was disappointed when I made some housekeeping requests via the Bonvoy app (there was a button that appeared after check in to make requests). Unfortunately we never received the items that I had requested until we made a call to the front desk. I had no problem calling the desk, however if you offer a service to make requests through the app it should be more closely monitored. Also, the chat function did not work either. Minor inconveniences, but worth a mention to look into! *i should  note our requests prior to arrival were completed in advance, these were made after check in*We reserved a club level studio suite, and while the Club Lounge was closed for renovations we were taken care of for evening service in one of their restaurants. The food was tasty, but we were particularly impressed with the tuna tartare and the specialty Thai whisky cocktails. Breakfast was included in our stay and was easily the most impressive breakfast buffet spread I have ever seen. Anything you could possibly imagine — they had it. Thai, Indian, Japanese, western... I could go on and on. Even if breakfast is not included in your stay, do not miss it. Our room was beautiful, and they decorated it for us for our anniversary — so cute! I left a separate, more complete review of the spa however we were a bit disappointed with the Thai massage. While it was a nice experience, it was not a traditional Thai massage which I have had previously. Overall, we had a wonderful (albeit short) stay. I would definitely return on a future trip to Thailand! ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Room having most of the necessary items but lack of the shaver which I could have request for.  The gym was OK but unable to find the floor mat for abs exercise and also no area for user to really work on abs.  Overall still a good gym.  Pool is quite good as shelter and offers good view. Club lounge, staff is OK BUT the food is fantastic. There are both Thai and western choice for breakfast and cocktail. What I really like is that the chef maintains the authenical taste of spice and taste of Thai food. Location is near to BTS, all shopping malls within walking distance and erawan shrine Is just 3 mins walk away.  Overall Renaissance maintains Marriott standard.  What I dislike... The card access for the lift and to the club lounge. At times after inserting numerous times in the lift.  you will be worried that you will miss your floor as the button will just not light up.  To the club lounge, will tends to miss the slot as corridor is rather dim.  The access card is black  in color makes the whole situation worst as unable to see the direction for insert.

80,5.0,"I have been visiting Bangkok for almost 20 years, but this was my first stay at the Renaissance Ratchaprasong.  Part of the reason for only just discovering the Renaissance is because I also lived in Bangkok for three years and stayed with friends after having moved away.  I know Bangkok well and have stayed at some of the best 5 star hotels in the city.  I can honestly say though the Renaissance is now at the top of this list.  As a Marriott Titanium Elite member, my choices for this trip were any one of the wonderful Marriott brands in Bangkok.  While I’m sure all offer similar comforts like the Renaissance, they cannot match its amazing location.  The Sukhumvit Chit Lom sky train stop is right outside the hotel’s door.  Given the fact that Bangkok ranks #11 as one of the world’s worst traffic cities, this is a HUGE plus.  If you want to go to the Chatachuk weekend market, the Sukhumvit line will get you there without even changing trains. A short walk away is also the Ratchadamri sky train stop on the Silom line which goes to the Chao Praya riverfront (Saphan Taksin stop) with access to Bangkok’s wats and temples via ferry and the Silom and Patpong night markets.  Also, some of the city’s best malls are within an easy 5 to 15 minute walk from the Renaissance - Siam Paragon, Central World, Gaysorn, Central Embassy, Amarin and the fabulous Cental Department Store.  Most offer first-class restaurants and incredible “food courts” with affordable and delicious international dishes and amazing shopping.One of the best parts of the Renaissance’s location is its proximity to Bangkok’s delightful Lumphini Park.  If you love to run or want to have an enjoyable walk after an early dinner, this is a must on your to-do list.  There are free outdoor aerobic classes, outdoor gyms, boat rides and occasional concerts.  It’s also the best people-watching around.  The park is completely safe even at night and is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel.  The Renaissance also has the best club lounge I’ve ever been to.  I watched as the lounge’s manager made sure that every possible comfort was afforded its guests.  The lounge offers breakfast, high tea and an incredible happy hour with a full range of appetizers and complimentary beer, wine and cocktails.  The service is impeccable.  If you’re looking for a wonderful, friendly Bangkok hotel that has it all, the Renaissance is it.  The rooms are well-appointed and spotlessly clean.

83,4.0,"This is a good location for shops, Sky train and central Bangkok. Rooms are a reasonable size with nice ensuite. Amenities in the room were not consistent each day. For example there was no body lotion for 2 days. We only had nuts etc on one of the turn down services. My only real reason for not giving this hotel five stars is that we had awful night sleeps. The bed is not very comfortable and the sound proofing between the rooms is non existent. We heard people talking at 1 am ,5 am and were woken by doors opening and shutting. We could hear people talking clearly in the early hours of the morning.On the plus side we had lounge access which was very good. Breakfast was enough and had a fresh egg station as well as local and western offerings. There is afternoon tea and 3 hours of wine, cocktails and also food for half an hour less in the early evening. The selection of food changed every day and was good. Lovely staff who were very helpful.Although we didn't try the indoor pool it did look nice. We did try the gym which has a reasonable range of equipment for a hotel but it was hot. The thermostats set at 24C! ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

85,5.0,"Very nice hotel hidden within downtown busy district of Ratchaprasong. Ideally you do not get hustle or bustle of the busy roads and activity around Ratchaprasong junction as it is hidden like 400m inside. The hotel only requires a 4mins walk to nearby Gaysorn or 6 Mins to BIG C or Central World.The staff were super nice people, they helped to change me some small notes which works both way for us both. I recall a lady when I was checking in, I cannot figure out how much coins worth is there and I thnk there was a slight shortage and she just gave me a new 20baht note in exchange, very good gesture.Service is top notch, the moment you call for them for supplies or cleaning etc they responds immediately. You know sometimes even their sister hotel JW Marriott would have issues with operator picking up, they would pick up almost immediatelyWe used their gym and pool facility, would say they are more than adequate and not very crowded. Some food market event was held throughout the weekends evening at the hotel carpark compound when we were there, they comprise of all the hotels associated to the Marriott group hawking their best foods as street food for sale, we tried some of the stalls absolutely marvellous.Nothing to be faulted, would love to live there again next time. Hopefully try their famous brunch on Sundays too.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
86,5.0,"First time visit to Bangkok.  No city I’ve been in of this size seemed quite so chaotic. 5 minutes of watching traffic, including drivers ignoring lane markers, multiple lane changes for no apparent reason, and those motorbike drivers who seem to think city streets are for motocross, and we decided to let others get us around.  Fortunately, the navigator staff at the hotel was up to the challenge.  They found just the right tours for what we wanted to do, each with hotel pickup and drop off.  Yes, BTS station is “right here” but it doesn’t serve enough areas (compared to say, Tokyo).  To each their own.Hotel accommodations were superb; we were provided a small suite upon arrival (at 2 in the morning).  Bonvoy Titanium status does afford some benefits.  Corner room, large bath, king bed. Only drawback would be building right next door (behind our always-closed bathroom shade).  It’s a bit disquieting “sitting” in the room and having some office person working at exactly room level in space that seems to be 10 feet away!!That, fortunately, was our only downside.  We ate our breakfasts in Flavors rather than the club lounge.  I have enjoyed many fine buffets within the Marriott family (Singapore, Yokohama, Dubai and Budapest come to mind) and Flavors is as good as any of them.  If you can’t find something you will enjoy eating in Flavors, we’ll, you must not be hungry!Other reviewers mentioned how wonderful the staff here is.  I concur.  I found myself wishing I carted around pen and paper to note all of their names.  Alas, that would be a daunting task.  Front desk, housekeeping, greeters, bartenders and wait staff, it doesn’t matter.  Everyone made us feel welcome anywhere we went.  It’s a credit to management, yes. But it is also a credit to each and every staff member that embodies what JW Marriott said so often: take care of the customer and the rest will take care of itself.  I teach collegiate organizational behavior and use that often with my students. My sincere gratitude to each of you that I encountered.Finally, since it was the club lounge staff I engaged with most often, I want to say a special ‘thank you’ to those of you whose name I do know.  Dew (no pun intended), Little, and One: you made our time here feel like we were home (when , in fact, we were 9,000 miles from our home.  I will say it this way: thank you for sharing your home with us.  A number of you stated that you hoped we will return.  I don’t know about that, but I sure feel I’d be welcome if we do.Please consider staying at this hotel if your travels bring you to Bangkok.  I think you will likely experience things as we did.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Breakfasts in the executive lounge were excellent. The daytime hostess, whose name I unfortunately didn't get was a joy to talk with. Not cheap, but if you can afford it highly recommended. If Bangkok wasn't so blessed hot I'd want to retire there and live in that hotel. ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
89,2.0,"I really wish this review could be a higher star review as I have stayed at this hotel many times over the few years it has been OK in the past but it's been consistently worse. Years ago when this was Starwood times were good but unfortunately status and being loyal to the property is barely even recognised anymore.I am a top tier member the Marriott program and I can say I have been fully #Bonvoyed this time. Don't get me wrong, the line staff at the hotel are very kind and do their best with their stretched limited resources, you can tell all the staff are very tired and overworked but keep a smile on their face.  The Thai people are very kind and will always help you when they can.Small things like a welcome card in the room are gone for people that spend 75+ nights with the brand. When it was SPG there used to be great amenities and welcome back gifts that cost the hotel nothing more than $5 each but meant a lot.  There isn't even fruit in the room anymore which is a common thing for even 3 star hotels in Thailand.I checked in past 3PM the normal check in time and long story short finally got into the room at around 9PM on the day of arrival. (Blamed it on a late check out guest) On that day I got a quick sorry and a few more excuses on why the room wasn't ready.  This was the most shocking part of the stay of which I am still upset about after traveling for for a day and half to get there and not getting a room on the guaranteed time.Note: There are not any traditional suites at this property except maybe the Presidential. They market a few of their upper rooms as suites, but are just basically slightly larger rooms at a much higher cost and really odd layouts. Literally they are just a slightly bigger space, no additional door separating the rooms, no additional powder room, dining space etc. If you need a real suite I would highly recommend other properties, all ""suites"" also only have a king bed so if you book 2 beds there are zero upgrades at the property. Note, if you do book a ""suite"" none of the curtains are truly black out, light will shine through the sides on all windows.I had issues with my key three times during my stay and was given different reasons each time I asked, but in the end it had to do with their vendors.  Also to note, there is zero ventilation in any of the bathrooms (no matter the room type) the bathrooms are very nice in size but they get very hot if the door is closed to the bathroom and or if someone leaves their scent it stays forever.Overall, the hotel is central there is no doubt about it but it is tucked a bit away from the BTS which is maybe a 5-10 min walk. It could be a really great hotel, the exec lounge is good but nothing I would pay for. During the breakfast they ran out of certain items as simple as coconuts which is a staple there.This property would really feel ideal only for business travelers staying a few nights The Internet cuts out everywhere you go and you have to sign on in different locations such as the lobby, room, lounge, gym etc. watch your roaming plans if you have one because the Internet can randomly stop if you don't log on.Overall, the hotel has potential it certainly does.  They keep it very clean and for its age it does keep well, but there are definite upgrades that could help the hotel. The line staff are very nice, but this is common throughout Thailand - the local people are hardworking and kind.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

44,5.0,"This was one out of five hotels I stayed at over a two month span. The Quarter Ladprao by UHG ranks at the top of them all. It very well may be one of the best hotels in Bangkok, especially when considering the amenities provided, the location, and the reasonable rates. Sure, not everyone's experience during their stay here is going to be the same but I think you'd really have to be searching for something to criticize to not enjoy yourself. The rooms were spacious and decorated in modern chic. The gym is fully functional proper gym. The pool is a rather nice size and presents a very comfortable area to lounge around. I thought the food was above average overall. The staff is terriffic- gym-side, poolside, in the restaurant, the housekeeping team, and the front desk staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful and always greeted guests with a smile. My most frequent interactions were with Mild, Chat, and Art at reception. They were service-friendly and did their best to address all of my inquiries and requests. They represent the entire Quarter Ladprao team extremely well. Good work Quarter Ladprao Hotel!

Had no problems getting breakfast which was included with our room package. Not in the middle of the city center but that suited us with a 3 year old in tow. Heaps of good food in Union Mall.

However, Oum and Chat helped us finding an available room, hence, we could do an early check-in immediately.

55,3.0,"Very good location, near MRT and BTS, new hotell. Good breakfast, but I am not totally happy with the service:After finding out that our bathroom and toilet was not cleaned, took pictures and went down to the reception to complain, asked a boy there that I wanted to talk to the manger, he told me that he is not here, what can I help you with?I told him the story that when I came back to the room after a long day in town and putting on the cleaning sign, putting the towels on floor (as a sign that you want a new one as told in the hotell card) I see that its not cleaned and I have still the old towels just folded with the same dirt on them. He said ok sorry I will tell the manager and tried to look away.I don't know what's going on, but I expected that he came with the solution, but no.Then I told him what now? can you get some one to fix this. after that he turned backh and said ok.what is this? I don't need to ask for this, He should come up with solutions.Next I asked for a Thai massage service that they had with a A4 ad and price list , it was full booked for now they said, but they could fix this next day at 11:00. guess what nobody showed up the next day after waiting and changing of day plan. After another complain, they arranged for 20:00. the lady showed up 20:10 finally.By the way, never saw that they clean the room floor.I don't know why this happened, but I expect dem to be more professional.Never heared from the manager.","The Quarter Ladprao by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
56,5.0,"This hotel is great, not only is it super reasonably priced for the service and amenities on offer/ location, but the overall feel of the hotel is that of a quality hotel.  I loved the gym, the pool and the restaurant, and of course the room was great.I am a bit of a conservationist, so I don't really like wasting material things.. This is why I was happy to see that the shower gel, shampoo and soap were all refillable.   This was great, because there was no waste in product packaging (also the three items were quite luxurious, made from really nice ingredients, that didn't dry my skin or hair at all).The front desk staff are really friendly and helpful.  I stayed for about 10 days in all so I kind of lived there a bit, Som in particular was so helpful.  She helped me plan where to go, how to get wherever I needed, and just general pleasant conversation, which I really appreciated.  All the staff did as much to make my stay as comfortable as possible. There was one funny incident (the first 3 days when I stayed on a different floor before moving).  There were two really loud women that were shouting/ talking at around 1-2 am.  I guess this sometimes happens (it's Bangkok) so maybe they were just rowdy from the night.  Apart from that all the guests were classy and kept noise to a minimum, or just enjoyed themselves without causing trouble to me or anyone else. All in all, a great place to stay, just outside the blue line (MRT) line, you get off at Phahon Yothin exit number 1 (this is incidentally the connecting station for the green BTS line, which is a 10 minute walk along the skywalk/ on the road/ or via the the mall if you go before the mall closes (at 10pm).  It's 1 minute outside exit 1 of the MRT line.  Very convenient.There's a 7-11 outside, which is great for all your daily essentials, well priced.For washing, I would recommend going to a launderette down the road (it's a 10 - 15  minute walk), on Soi 18, walk out the hotel, go on the main road and turn right, and continue walking for 10 -15 minutes, the launderette is called White Rabbit (costs about 40 baht for a wash/ 40 for a tumble dry etc).  Open at usual times of the day, and no queues when I went twice in the evenings.The food at Hilly's/ room service is so good.  I advise ordering the Thai dishes, they are so yummy and healthy.  I would avoid the western dishes (not many on the menu, but if you're in Thailand you may as well eat Thai food, you can eat your normal food when at home !).","The Quarter Ladprao by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

They even give you welcome drink coupons that we later used at the restaurant. Deluxe room is definitely worth it. It is much bigger and nicer. We requested a quiet room on a high floor. That is exactly what we got. Our room was on the 12th floor facing a quiet alley. The view from the balcony was amazing at all hours of the day. Smart TV, comfortable bed, clean bathroom with the necessary toiletries, fridge, umbrella, safe, hangers and tea, coffee, water stocked daily, etc., everything we possibly needed was provided. The rooms are cleaned very well daily. The breakfast buffet is yummy with many choices. Every staff we met was super nice and always greeted us with a smile.

During the evening they turn on the lights around the pool, and it looks so freaking romantic.Also bonus points, 7 eleven is right outside and MRT station is literally 1 minute walk. If you are taking the MRT get of at the Phahon yothin station! We got of at Lat phrao station and had to take a taxi to the hotel.

The spacious balcony made me a full rest for a day even I spent more time out there than inside. One thing I personally like to suggest is that it would be so good to have a water hose installed at the toilet.The facilities in and around the hotel were just perfectly convenient. There was a 7-eleven convention store located just in the same vicinity. There was also a beautiful small garden right from the main entrance to the riverside pier where the hotel shuttle boat service was on standby every 30 minutes for departing to main Saphan Thaksin pier.I was also thankful Chalida who checked me out of the hotel who provided the hospitable service with her lovely smile.

We encountered some problems in our room. We  just thought that it was due to covid, but they were kind enough to compensate it by upgrading our room to a 1 bedroom suite with one of the best views we had and even gave us an option to check out anytime we want. The food is also excellent. We thought that we will only have an a la carte breakfast for two days, but due to higher number of guests, they provided a buffet breakfast.Thank you so much, Chatrium Hotel Riverside.

Also, big thanks to hotel manager whom accommodated my request in every possible way he could.  The 2BR suites overlook the river was stunning. View from the balcony at sunset and nighttime can really take your breath away and we spent a lot of time taking pictures there. Love the location and how convenient it is to go anywhere.Room was nice, almost fully equipped, but you can always ask the customer service if there is anything missing. In my case was toothbrush, but i didn't mind. All staffs are friendly and supportive. The reception remember my name and room number from my last stay. Bellboy also know my nick name (due to all the food delivery i have ordered to hotel). Love the bed and pillows as always, soft and smell nice. Second bedroom has limited space but i didn't spend much time there anyway. Breakfast was beautiful and not so bad. Fluffy pancake was not good, try avoiding it. Bakery was so-so, Thai food was good, egg dishes were cooked perfectly. AC in master bedroom was leaking at 11 pm but we didn't want to lose our sleep on them coming in to fix. Nothing major though.

After I read the TA reviews and saw the incredible prices for the Quarter Silom, I booked using their website.    Check in and out were positive experiences as staff easily communicated in English.    But the reception area is small so I can see that it might get hectic with large groups.     Further, the parking situation is limited for but it’s easily accessible via the BTS or Grab car.   As mentioned the property is new so the room furnishing are very nice and there are plenty of outlets for devices.    They also have mood lighting which was a fun touch.     The bed and bedding are good quality and it was easy to fall asleep quickly.  Strong consistent wifi throughout the room and property; as well as a good AC system.    The shower pressure is strong and there was plenty of hot water.    The room also had a kettle, mini fridge, and microwave.   The hotel offers an inexpensive breakfast including Western and Thai offerings.   Overall the buffet was just ok and this would be an area that they could easily improve.       The property also has a well equipped fitness center including wet and dry saunas.    There’s also a small pool.      Overall - a very positive experience especially given their low rates.

37,5.0,"I used to stay here for 10 day in January, the hotel was super nice and cheap. Good employees and all are able to speak proper english, this is definitely a plus. Back then the price was around 420baht a night. In March in decided to stay here for 1 night. The price is now about 200 Baht more but the service is still the same. Everything nice, good and super professional. The price is reasonable. The hotel is located near the Si Lom complex with nice restaurants and shops inside. It's close to the lumpini park (15min walking),  close to the Bts Sala Daeng (walking around 8min) and close to the MRT Si Lom (walking around 12min). For short and long stay I can highly recommend the Quarter. With a motorcycle it's only 10min from Asok/ Sukhumvit where the Terminal 21 is located. The Quarter is not a skyscraper hotel.

After I read the TA reviews and saw the incredible prices for the Quarter Silom, I booked using their website.    Check in and out were positive experiences as staff easily communicated in English.    But the reception area is small so I can see that it might get hectic with large groups.     Further, the parking situation is limited for but it’s easily accessible via the BTS or Grab car.   As mentioned the property is new so the room furnishing are very nice and there are plenty of outlets for devices.    They also have mood lighting which was a fun touch.     The bed and bedding are good quality and it was easy to fall asleep quickly.  Strong consistent wifi throughout the room and property; as well as a good AC system.    The shower pressure is strong and there was plenty of hot water.    The room also had a kettle, mini fridge, and microwave.   The hotel offers an inexpensive breakfast including Western and Thai offerings.   Overall the buffet was just ok and this would be an area that they could easily improve.       The property also has a well equipped fitness center including wet and dry saunas.    There’s also a small pool.      Overall - a very positive experience especially given their low rates.

15,2.0,"We stayed for only a night with 5 rooms in total. Rooms were nice but balcony was too small making it feel congested when you're there. I would prefer having that tiny balcony added into the in room floor area. Upon check-in we requested if a late checkout at 2:00pm would be possible and they said ""only for the 4 rooms and until 1:00pm for the twin room"" so we were fine with that. We checked-in around 4:00pm and they gave us 2 rooms first saying that the other 3 rooms were not ready yet because we want rooms on the same floor (isn't it obvious that all bookings were named after 1 person and there's a high probability that we would need rooms on the same floor?), we turned a blind eye on that because we want to have a swim first.The next day we swam again after breakfast-- Breakfast was decent with very attentive staff specially Ms. Angie. When we came back around 12:20pm while at shower the phone kept ringing. Then my friends from the other room said that the receptionist called telling that we should checkout. My friend said that we requested a late checkout when we checked in, then the receptionist said that they will only allow 2 rooms. We were like ""what happened?""-- then we  moved to the 2 rooms hurriedly while my other friends just came out from shower. How does endorsement run in their Front Office? If they really need the room I would understand, given that they should've informed a night before or even hours ahead (this decision making is a matter of commonsense).When we checked out we were the one who said thank you upon leaving the lobby door. I don't know if they are too busy, feel guilty of what they did, or they were just pissed off that we didn't post yet the TripAdvisor that they are soliciting to post when we checked-in in return for the late checkout.","The Quarter Phromphong By UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

They are perhaps the sweetest, yet most invisible people in the entire hotel. However, I deeply appreciate and acknowledge their presence. At FNB, there is a young gentleman who is always cheery and has a memorable hair style. There is another host who stoically yet efficiently runs the floor - always offering bacon or omelette. The lady also is all smiles during breakfast.The trifecta of front desk ladies: the assistant manager, the courteous Filipina, and Beam all seem to effortlessly charm the guests, including myself. Business is indeed sweet as usual. The bellboys are good. Ma and the other gentlemen are professional and always prioritize guest satisfaction - a strong addition to the team. The security team also deserve a mention as their responsibilities are truly challenging, yet they still miraculously manage a smile.For the night shift, Sky and Mickey are nice and fun. Yet perhaps due to odd hours or inexperience they drop the ball on service once in a while but definitely make up for it and more at other times.

AC work properly no noise but room not really soundproof I still can heard people talk or walked pass the door. In room also provided coffee and tea bags , 2 bottles of water complimentary and some bathroom amenities. Their shower gel and hand gel also good one.Oh.. one thing that very surprised me was their buffet breakfast it is very good, worth to booked it. Varies of food dishes, fruits and bakery.

Special mention goes to the shuttle service the hotel provides to the nearby BTS PhromPhong/ EMquartier shopping centre - on one of my excursions out of the hotel, the driver, who had somehow recognised me (i was several minutes away from the hotel by then), stopped to offer me a ride as he was going past - it was a gesture but one that goes a long way.","The Quarter Phromphong By UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

0,4.0,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate the Valentine’s day. One of the main reason to choose this hotel on this special occasion was that we wanted to see by our own eyes the magnificent view over the Chao Phraya River, described by many guests for a long time. Although the property itself was a bit old, the other parts, comprising to become this hotel were just perfect in terms of its location, room, food and staff’s services. The hotel was situated along the Chao Phraya River, the main river in Thailand, flowing through Bangkok. Getting to the hotel by a car or a boat was the most convenient way as it was a bit far from the Bangkok Sky Trains or Public transportations. The Icon Siam, a huge and luxury department store was the right opposite the hotel. There was a free shuttle boat service to the Mall from Sri Phraya Pier, where was within the walking distance.We stayed on the 20th floor in an Executive Suit room. The room was divided into two main parts i.e. the living room and the bedroom and it had old-style built-in furniture, but clean and well maintained. Once we got into our room, the housekeeping team had beautifully prepared something special from folding towels and flower on the bed. Views from the two rooms were a bit different. While the more lively and busier river view could be seen from the living room, the quieter view with no high buildings alongside the river was seen from the bedroom side. The property’s location and the room’s position allowed us to enjoy the stunning views of the River not only during the daytime, but also the colourful lights from the Shopping Mall and several river dinner cruises during the nighttime. Such enchanting atmosphere absolutely gave us a memorable picture from the stay. We were so impressed by staff and their awesome services at every part of hotel. Before the stay, the Reservation team, especially Khun Kae and Khun Air had amazed us by their friendliness and support. On the arrival day, once we stepped into the hotel, we had been greeted by an energetic concierge, who led us to meet Khun Pannate, the Assistant Front Office Manager for checking in. The way she served us showed her professional and polite manner. Although she was wearing a face mask all the times, we could feel a very warm welcome from her smile and charm under the mask. Moreover, Khun David, the lounge manager and the staff at Giogio’s restaurant including Khun Bew, Khun Ice and Khun Na were very active and energetic, although the restaurant was packed. There were not so many selections for breakfast, but some Thailand’s street-food-style food such as stir fried pork with basil leaf was wonderful. We could not be happier than savoring the moment of having good food, sipping a glass of wine and watching the moving lives along the river during the sunset and sunrise time here. In conclusion, this hotel is definitely well worth returning more and more.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

Breakfast was standard though - good variety but average quality and taste.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
5,4.0,"Like the review written on Feb 14 by another guest, the hotel was overcrowded and out of control during dining. But I was more dis-satisfied by the GM. I booked the stay Feb12 on Jan30, trying to get the ""Travel together promotion"" 40% subsidised by government. Reservation staff told me not to hurry to pay, deadline was Feb9. I called Feb8 and tried to complete the payment process, but I was told the quota was full. Same thing happened to my booking with another Marriot hotel. I was put on waiting list in both cases. Feb11, the other Marriott hotel informed me the payment link and my booking was completed successfully. There was no news from Sheraton in between. Anyway, I kept my booking and stayed at Sheraton on Feb12 (at full cost) with no subsidised. I emailed the situation to the GM. His working attitude was not down to the earth, kind of out to the sky! He immediately passed along my feedback to subordinate. I emailed him back again over a week later as no update from the hotel at all in between. The GM again passed along my 2nd email to somebody to follow. Another hotel staff tried to call me several times at my private times. The sarcastic thing is the staff tried to call me asking me what do I want and tell/share anything to her. Over to al these confusions created by somebody's miscommunication, I felt it was hopeless to transmit message to this hotel, namely GM, because he kept calling me by phone after creating this confusion, which is a channel I don't prefer, specially to calls without purpose!In conclusion, this hotel didn't care who paid the bill (government or me) as long as the money was received. Secondly, The GM tried to fool me or himself about what happened (to me). Now I don't need the hotel to followup anything, but share my experience here. Thank you!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

8,5.0,"The arrival was surprised me since I just open the car door, the bell man (or uncle) came right away from the door to help me pick up all the luggage, not even need my asking.  The front desk is very professional and welcoming, well arranged my request due to partners birthday, they even arrange the maid to help me on the decorations, really appreciated.  There were many guests checkin due to the CNY, but my check in was handled smoothly without any waiting. All the rooms here are facing river and my room is on the 27th floor and facing iconsiam, which is very nice view while chilling at the room. Also, the ceiling to floor window let you feel the view is part of room The hotel is aged, this is not deniable, so you can see the history from the decoration and in room facilities. You can see them trying to meet the new gen needs by set up a 50” LED smart TV, it would be great if they have the HDMI input next to working desk. During the pandemic, Sheraton Club is closed, so the lounge service is moved to the Feast or Giogio depend on the numbers of club room or platinum guest checked in.  Luckily we were in the super busy timing, so the service was provided at Feast in almost “buffet” style which is way to much to spoil the customers. Sheraton provides variety of salads and hot foods such as gra pao beef, Thai curry, fired noodles, also mock tails and deserts.  You could almost have it as an official dinner , only one little thing can be done better-the coffee beans need a change, then everything will be perfect.  Special thanks to the club manager David and his team Ice who took care of us very well during the lounge time. You can feel their passionate of helping and accommodating the guest, I really appreciate that. David’s talk is friendly and make you feel like staying here as home of a very welcoming friend host. While the 2nd night at lounge, Ice could even recognize us and help to arrange entering while we were stuck in the queue at the entrance due to other guests with some issues. Also, I would like to thanks the F&B team help on the CNY dinner arrangement, because i have updated my guest number many times and they helped to arrange it wonderful river front view, all my guests were so glad with the nice food and great fireworksBy the way, the main pool is unbelievable with a depth 3m as hotel pool. So I can do some basic diving practice here and relaxing in the pool since the depth avoid young kids here Anyway, thanks to the Sheraton and the team, it gave me a memorable CNY and partner BD celebration. Hope to see come renovation in the future to be able to compete with newly coming river side hotels. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

It was my mother  birthday during our stay, which we had not mentioned, but they obviously saw that at the check in. It was a lovely surprise when they left a  birthday cake in the room!

11,5.0,"We have stayed in a fair number of 5 star hotels over the past 12 months and the Sheraton Royal Orchid in Bangkok is by far the best, streaks ahead of other known brands such as the Ritz Carlton Riyadh (which was by far the  most disappointing - avoid). The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive, the location outstanding, the room (Executive Club Suite) was good, the breakfast outstanding and the hotel very clean. The management team have managed to maintain a very high standard of covid safety and cleanliness and not, as many others have done, used the pandemic to drop their standards whilst maintains their prices. Bravo to the whole team at the Sheraton Royal Orchid, for making our stay the most relaxing and enjoyable experience across all other brands and we will without doubt return as the Royal Orchid is now on our list of favorite hotels around the globe. Highly recommended and you set the bar for how to run a classy facility as close to a pre-covid experience as we could have reasonably expected. Fabulous!!

12,5.0,"I decided to surprise my family with a staycation at the Sheraton Royal Orchid and it was absolutely lovely. Although, it is an older building, it is well kept and its location is perfect. With river views and easy access to Icon Siam and Talad Noi, it was perfect for a little escape. I would highly recommend securing a club room as you have a bit more space, view of the river and the club perks. The customer service was great and the breakfast - while not huge (understandable given COVID), it was clean and had a decent variety of food for everyone (including my vegan husband). The only bummer was the construction at the pier, which ruined the relaxing atmosphere at the beautiful garden pool, but I am sure the Sheraton could not do anything about that. All in all, a lovely staycation for us all.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
20,4.0,"Shortly after our check in, we headed for the Garden Pool. The Garden Pool is located at the side of the hotel over a small stairway. It was like a secret garden with a huge pool alongside Chao Phraya River. About 3 years back when the company I work had her event here, I was not even aware that this pool existed. It was 3 pm, our pool time. The sun was high and warmed the water good this cool season. What surprised us was, we spotted a peacock lingering in the garden. The several children, my kid inclusive, excitedly gave chase herding the lone bird around in amazement over the find. The next day, we were back at the pool and there were more peacocks, about 6 of them. I think, by the next weekend, there will be one peacock in every room. True to the receptionist’s words, this is the better of the 2 pools for kids.This Sheraton is kind of vintage. The atmosphere is like my grandfather had once stayed here before. Trendy is not what you will find, grandeur will be a suitable association. Our room is located on the 29th floor and posed on a strategic side that faces west. It is the best direction which gave an awesome view of the river below and a wide almost 180 expanse of the urban-scape. Iconic Iconsiam, we could see the dazzling fountain show in the night from our room. Millennium Hilton was directly opposite, if her dome right at the top is any bigger, it will look like NCC-1701 from Star Trek. An oval desk was placed right by the large window and facing out. I really enjoyed the times I worked on my notebook glancing between view and screen, and half expecting Millennium Hilton to fly away at warp speed. Our room was sizable, enough space for my kid to roll around all over the floor. There is an oversized tub in the spacious bathroom, she enjoyed her bubble bath within. Two double beds we tucked ourselves into for the night, plenty comfy lush pillows, a very good sleep. Lots of proper English channels on the large flatscreen.We had club lounge access privileges. What a shame the Executive Lounge on 29th was not opened. All activities congregated in Giorgio's. A restaurant turned common area for all breakfast, lounge access and dining located on the 2nd floor by the pool. Somehow, it did felt only like an uplifted canteen. I had Fish and Chips for lunch. What was in the menu stated Cod. I am a fish person, I know I was not eating Cod. It was some giant seabass meat. The English meal did not exhibit excellent batter crisp neither. Dinner time, a few options. Thai restaurant, the heavy on the wallet buffet on the ground floor, or enjoy the benefits of club lounge access in Giorgio's. Many guests took on the third, we did. The food spread was not extensive, but we all had a decent dinner. Since it was Covid season and the guests were close to all Thais, it was then real authentic Thai food in the club buffet. Hot dishes were Minced Pork in Chili Basil, curry looking vegetable thingy dish, Spicy Coconut Milk Chicken Soup and Baked Seabass no spicy. With the majority looking fierce and with that minced pork dish that was so potent and authentic, first it sets your mouth on fire, the next day it sets your other end on fire. Awesome real Thai food the way it should be. For the breakfast experience, for me, it was just average run of the mill and I cannot state anything spectacular about it. Anyhow, it was still a good breakfast and I am all positives about it.     Of all the city hotels in Bangkok I had been to so far, this has got to be one of the best in terms of conduciveness if it is coupled to a busines trip. Early in the morning, I sat in the one and only discrete open pavilion right before the stairwell to the Garden Pool. The air was cool, I could hear the river and the birds. An electrical outlet powered my notebook for a good two hours while I was on boosted productivity thanks to the vibes. And then there was the awesome view from the working desk in the room. As a family with young kids, the Garden Pool will be the highlight. And the peacocks too. As a couple, evening time by the outdoor chairs during the cool months sipping cocktails is romantic. For the shopaholic, the pier next door provides complementary rides across to Iconsiam.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
21,1.0,"the quality and the services of this hotel is very disappointing. I had a very horrible experience atBKK sheraton during a business travel last week on oct 2020The hotel staff gave me a room when I stepped into the bathroom, I immediately sense a disgusting smell within the bathroom. The smell is unbearable. In a normal  5-star hotel, there should be people checking the room and making sure everything is fine before a customer walk in. Their room manager came in and checked the room and they agreed with the problems of the room. I immediately called the staff and requested for a change of room.Meanwhile,the lounge food also poor at all and lost my appetite and complained.I wished to speak with the GM of this hotel and I asked them to leave the GM's business card in my room the next day. They agreed but they didn't do it accordingly. Overall this is a very disappointing stay. The experience is leaving me with unaddressed grievances.

22,5.0,"We were here for a staycation over a weekend, the hotel is perfectly located by the riverside overlooking the Chao phraya river. The staff at the hotel is warm and always ready to make your stay wonderful!The hotel rooms are cozy and carry the  warmth of the old times and at the same time offering all you expect from a modern hotel, it is infact getting the best of both the worlds. The rooms are fully equipped, spacious and offer some spectacular view. F&B offerings are pretty good, breakfast spread had a good variety, the riverside grill  offers a wide variety of lip smacking food. The Thai restaurant Thara Thong looked quite attractive but unfortunately we couldn't eat there as it is only open for dinner. The hotel has two pools one is a conventional modern pool while the other is a garden pool surrounded by a lush green garden and trees, it's quite a charming spot in the hotel.The access to other attractions is quite easy from the hotel as the public pier for the boat service is just next to the hotel, the pier for the shuttle boat to icon Siam is also next to the hotel on the other side. China Town is at a walking distance from the hotel you can experience the stroll through the narrow lanes.

27,1.0,"I have been a frequent guest at Royal Orchid Sheraton for the past 6-7 years. This stay was the stay that destroyed every trust and loyalty I have with the hotel. Where I come from, GUESTS are treated with respects not INSULTED at the gates. It’s hard to understand how HURT I felt to be treated like my patronage for the past 6 years does not mean anything to the hotel and treated poorly at the doorstep of a place I consider my second home. I was thinking of giving Royal Orchid Sheraton another chance of REDEMPTION this month since I have trips to Bangkok this October and more trips in December but I decided to try JW Marriott instead and it was very wonderful and perhaps it’s time I change my second home since Royal Orchid Sheraton no longer welcomes Returning Loyal Guest (and I quote “The Hotel does not have returning guest loyalty” said the Duty Manager to my face on my arrival check in.)Most importantly, I PRAY that in the future IF I EVER will return to Royal Orchid Sheraton, the hotel will improve with at least the STANDARD that Royal Orchid Sheraton had shown me in the past or this would be THE LAST TIME I ever come back to the hotel since my long-time patronage to the hotel isn’t recognized anymore.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

Hote facilities consists of gym, sauna, jacuzzi, tennis court with basketball hoop and two swimming pools but the downside being the Tennis court were constantly booked up throughout the time we requested even though I noticed sometimes people whom may have booked may turn up really late for their session which the hotel could release that time for us to use the court. But what made the stay good was the Staff, from housekeeping, front, door man to the restaurant staff were excellent and provided heartfelt service. Overall clean and comfortable place to stay.

It was all you can eat but it also an ordering. You cannot choose what to eat if. So Waste of good food when we asked not to put stuff that we dont want to eat.

31,5.0,"This hotel often gets stars knocked off by other reviewers because of the rooms & dated decor but I'm happy to give it 5 stars. Here's why...- location is great, on the river, across from IconSiam mall, taxis take you from the door to anywhere, other food places & cafes dotted outside - check in & check out smooth and easy- 2 pools, 1 of which (the garden pool) is a little oasis away from the city. I live in Bangkok city and it's rare to stay in the city and feel like you're not in it. Their garden pool is relaxing and quiet- awesome food. In fact, the best fish & chips I've had outside of England (lunch at the garden pool). Breakfast has more than enough choices for all tastes - thai green curry, fried rice with shrimp, pork buns, eggs, bacon, pastries etc etc. - our room was high on the 22nd floor with a stunning view across the Chao Phraya River. No, the rooms and hotel are not as glamorous as their Marriott Marquis hotel in the city or the Millennium Hilton across the river but they are totally adequate for a good stay. Wifi, air con, bed comfort were all excellent though. If you're expecting and need the most stunning decor then don't stay here. If you're happy with still-decent decor & furnishings plus all the other great things about the Sheraton, you won't feel disappointed. If you want a great stay on the river, great location, friendly staff, nice food, good facilities (gym, pools, spa etc), clean & adequate-enough rooms, good wifi, good air con, 2 relaxing pools to choose from, then don't hesitate to book!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

We stayed in the Presidential or 'Royal Orchid' suite and it was immense. 263sq metres of awesome, and the team i.e Mathieu, Natthaya (on our private cruise) were fantastic in organising complimentary meals upon meals, a private cruise and the service from ALL staff was immense. Everyone knew our names, everyone was courteous, everyone went above and beyond and Orhun (the Manager) made an effort to greet us on arrival. The meals were incredible, filet steak was unreal, lobster was best I've ever eaten (and 13 years in Thailand I've eaten my fair share of lobster) and their boat was 'out of service' due to the plandemic, but they took us out on the boat for a private sunset cruise with Champagne and Canopes.Would highly recommend a stay here.

As the value for the money is so satysfying and the hotel seemed to be cleaner and newer than pre Covid. The check in and check out was smooth and the room and all the other facilities were spotless clean and well prepared. Only the regret was the service at the restaurant. When I order food for my breakfast, I had to wait literally for one hour until the food were served. It was so hard to catch any staff's eyes in the restaurant, I started to wonder whether they were trying to avoid eye contacts with guests carefully. Taste of western food was not impressive, I'd say 5 out of 10, however Thai food was GREAT.Oh, I shouldn't forget to mention the river view from the room was fantastic!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

The hotel provides a shuttle boat to the nearby sky train station making it very convenient to go out and about.What I noticed was the room looked tired. I saw wear and tear in the bed fabric here and there. The hotel overall looks under-maintained. All in all, I could notice much of the hotel's regression in overall conditions compare to what it was years ago. We enquired for halal food prior to our arrival and was told that halal food was not 'an option'.I found this to be a little disappointing as I would love to see the hotel be more accommodating to various dietary requirements be halal or kosher etc. This hotel was on the top of my list for many years but given the recent stay and experience, I might have to consider other possibilities.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

However, some of the rooms are fairly tired and staff seemed the same way. Some staff were wonderful, some were not very helpful at all. The older staff who have been there for quite some time are always helpful. Some of the younger newer staff didn't appear to want to be there at all. At the moment the lounge is still closed. Breakfast is limited but that seems to be due to Covid. Again, it's not expensive so if you have limited expectations you will probably be happy. The views from the rooms are all river facing.

We usually stay near Lumpini park, but we really enjoyed being on the river and only a few minutes walk from China town.

It was also a pleasant surprise to see beautiful peacocks roaming around hotel gardens and the garden pool. We were impressed with the services of hotel staff, who are very professional, caring, and attentive.

As soon as I arrived at the hotel with a tired body and opened the curtains, the beautiful night view of the Chao Phraya River and iKONSIAM caught my eyes, and rather than tiredness, I felt happy that I had traveled. Above all, the bed was really soft. One unfortunate thing was that the bathroom's magnification mirror was a little small, but it was a good hotel overall. There were many kinds of breakfast, and the elevator was pleasant. However, the air conditioner was so strong that it was a little cold when I slept.한국에서 저녁 비행기로 밤에 태국에 도착했다. 지친 몸을 이끌고 호텔에 도착해 커튼을 열자마자 차오프라야 강과 iKONSIAM의 아름다운 야경이 눈에 띄었고, 피곤함보다는 여행을 다녀온 것이 행복했다. 무엇보다 침대가 정말 부드러웠다. 한 가지 아쉬운 점은 욕실의 확대 거울이 조금 작지만 전체적으로 좋은 호텔이라는 점이었다. 아침식사는 종류가 많았고, 엘리베이터는 쾌적했다. 하지만 에어컨이 너무 세서 잠을 잘 때는 조금 추웠다.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

I was back in April of 2018 to visit one of my daughters who was doing a backpacking tour in SE Asia and ended up staying at the Royal Orchid for a couple nights on my way to the islands to meet up with her. Loved the hotel, keep in mind that I had normally stayed in some of the backpacker haunts along Khao san/Rambuttri area for many years prior to this visit. I returned again in 2019 with my youngest daughter and my niece. I had arranged for us to stay on a small guest house in Talad Noi which lasted one night. As we were out walking that first morning we walked by the entrance of the Sheraton and the girls asked me, Do you think they have a pool, to which I replied....yes, I stayed here last year and lived the pool. That was my first mistake and before I know it we were booking into the Sheraton!! The girls loved both pools, views of the river, shops nearby and the bike tour we did with the company just down the road from the hotel. This is a lovely property, has great pools, away from some of the craziness the girls did not need to see and really provided us with a great place to rest up from our jet lag and then move into the next stages of our trip which was a night train to Surat Thani and onto Koh Phangan!

The staff was incredible. They were beyond friendly, went out of their way to be of support and service to us, and were extremely professional. Nimit was wonderful for our family and regularly had conversations with us and our son during our comings and goings. Another staff member made a paper airplane for our son one afternoon while we waited for dinner to be delivered. From the concierge to the front desk, from the housekeeping staff to the wait staff at breakfast, we could not have asked for more. The breakfast was delicious and offered great variety. We ate each morning outside by the river where our son could enjoy watching boats passing as we ate. The proximity of the hotel to the river was wonderful. We utilized both the express river taxi and the free shuttle to IconSiam on numerous occasions. They were simple to use and extremely easily accessible. We loved both pools at the hotel and also enjoyed using the fitness center. The service at each was spectacular and the setting beautiful. We were at the hotel during the COVID-19 outbreak and always felt safe and informed. The staff was extremely professional in their handling of this matter and cleanliness thoughout the hotel was outstanding. There was even an attendant stationed in the hotel lobby disinfecting the buttons after each elevator button was pushed or car utilized. All in all, we were completely blown away by the service, the food, and the comfort of this beautiful riverside hotel.

The value was unbeatable. As elite members we were given a club floor room. The room was very nicely appointed. Our room looked to have been updated. Nice spacious bathroom with tub and shower and had everything we needed. The floor to ceiling windows gave a gorgeous view of the river. The club lounge was also very nice and the breakfast offered was very nice with much more variety than was expected. Same with happy hour where they had a wonderful selection of food........ enough really for a full dinner if you wanted. Service was also very good. Everyone very helpful with anything we needed. We left Bangkok to head to Krabi for 4 days and were able to leave some luggage there as we were coming back. The shuttle boat taking you to iconsiam is very convenient and comfortable. The ride itself is a sightseeing event. It’s easy to hop on river cruises/boat taxis etc to visit sites as well as a quick cab ride to Silom area sites. There are 2 pools, one overlooking the river and the garden pool which was our preference. Overall a great place! ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
49,5.0,We’ve recently stayed at this hotel and will definitely recommend. It is perfectly located at the riverside with beautiful views across the river. The hotel is spotless and the staff are always making sure it is clean. All the staff were so helpful and always smiling! We will definitely be returning. Thank you,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
50,5.0,"From the minute you enter the hotel to your check out this hotel offers all that is needed for your stay in Bangkok. The views of the river. The accessibility to their own Private boat taking you up and down the river. To the service either at their extraordinary Breakfast Buffet of many nations, or poolside. Food preparation and service all exemplary. To take the regular boats to the temples you simply walk out the front door and the alley entrance is right there. NO hassle NO fuss. This to me was a  great spot to start our 3rd. trip to Bangkok and we are never disappointed with any facets of the Royal Orchid. Kudos to all the staff who made our stay exemplary.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
51,4.0,Really good position on the river views from rooms are spectacular. Really good boat taxi free across the river to the shopping mall. Good access to other transport. The rooms was a little shabby and in need if updating. Not a cheap hotel for food or drinks. Breakfasts good variety but you were sometimes rushed a little if you went down towards the end they finished at 10.30 but wanted you out by 10.15. It was quiet when we were there wouldn’t like to go in busy times as breakfast were the only busy part we saw.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
52,4.0,"We love the SPG group but this hotel was disappointing. It has a shabby feel. We stayed on the top Executive floor. The carpets in the corridor smelled old and used. I must say, though, that the one good thing about the hotel was the Executive lounge which has a very good cocktails spread and drinks selection. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast on the Executive floor is really good. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
53,4.0,"Nice and reasonably priced, if you're looking for a bit of a luxury without blowing the wallet. Room is spacious and has a nice river view. Icon Siam Mall right across the river is such a lovely complex, ranging from a variety of local food, to high end restaurants and luxury brands. Even if you're not a shopping buff, it's worth visiting. The only issue with this hotel is the location. The best way to travel in/out is by taxi. The river ferry is possible too but you could wait quite long on a weekend as the frequency is slow. It's also further away from known attractions such as the shukumvit area. It's good if you want to stay at the river and plan to visit the grand palace.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
54,4.0,"We stayed here as part of a Luxury Escape package.It's across the river from a shopping plaza which was handy at times.  There's a hotel ferry plus some local ferries.The room was very nice with a lovely view of the river.Staff were friendly and helpful, although some did express the opinion that being on a Luxury Escape package, we did get things free of charge. We felt obliged to inform them that we had actually paid for the package.The buffet breakfast was excellent.  Unfortunately the set menu dinner at the Thara Thong restaurant was totally the opposite.  We had a better meal at the pop up Thai restaurant acroos the road.Both pools were very good.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
55,5.0,"We really enjoyed staying at The Royal Orchid Sheraton. Our room was very comfortable and had a lovely view of the river. The hotel is adjacent to a river ferry stop so it was easy to reach many of the important sights such as the Royal Palace and Wat Arun. After sightseeing we relaxed by the pool overlooking the river... so much to see while sipping a nice cocktail or beer ! The breakfast buffet was extensive with a wide selection of Thai and Western dishes, and we could enjoy our meal on the riverfront terrace. The Thai restaurant on-site was delicious and had nightly entertainment of Thai music and dancing. All of the staff were very courteous and professional. We highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again when in Bangkok ! ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
56,4.0,"+ Very good breakfast. Free shuttle to the other side f the river. Great views from the room. Nice staff. - Old fashioned decorated. Some of the taxis in front of the hotel are scam. They will a ""special price"", even it is not, but you have to make a stop with them on shops were they have commission. Something like this choose other one. The door staff of the hotel should be more careful when you ask them a taxi. Concierge is good.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
57,4.0,MY Husband and I stayed here at the beginning of our holiday in Thailand. Checking in was very quick and one niggle it would  have been  to be welcomed with a drink after a long journey. But overall great location and everything clean . Great pool areas and plenty of fresh towels on hand.  We were offered an upgrade at a good price for a  club room which gave you access to the club lounge on the top floor and everyday at certain times  you were offered free drinks and food including cocktails were amazing and felt very spoilt. Overall great location and easy access for transport . Definately be back next year.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
58,5.0,"I have to confess that I'm not normally the greatest fan of Bangkok however, a stay at this hotel has changed my perception of the city entirely. Located next to the river, it provides a perfect opportunity to sit with a drink in your hand and watch the night-time hustle and bustle of party boats and light shows.The bars and restaurants belonging to the hotel are stylish and the food is very good. I can recommend Georgio's if you are a lover of Italian food and wine. The rooms are certainly well equipped and clean. Ask for a river view if you plan to stay. You will not be disappointed.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
59,4.0,"WOW. Stayedat this hotel for a couple of nights. Terrific location. First class river views from our rooms. Service was genuinely friendly and warm. Breakfast was really good with heaps of local cuisine. Will difinetly return to this clean, friendly and warm hotel when I next visit Bangkok.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
60,5.0,"The hotel was beautiful, situated right on the river.  The property had 2 pools and a dock where they provided a courtesy water shuttle to several stops along the river.  This allowed the guest to actually pick up other courtesy water taxis to get to various attractions such as Icon and Asiatique shopping and entertainment venues.  Tuk Tuk and Taxis were readily available to take you to other parts of the city as well.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
61,4.0,"Occupied a premier room on the 24th floor. The room had an exceptional view but was small. All amenities were provided, the room was well maintained and cleaned. A big disappointment was the size of the bathroom which did not provide any space for personal items on the vanity. The large buffet breakfast provided for all tastes and appetites.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
62,5.0,"Stayed at this lovely hotel for our first 2 nights in Thailand on our 15day tour. Was great hotel, with great views, great rooms and perfect location. Staff were great and we were greeted at 8am after a long flight and taken care off brilliantly. We decided to upgrade on arrival being a member and wow, great that we did. We had breakfast for both days included, a room on the 27th floor which also allowed you to have Free drinks between 4:30-7:30 and snacks 5:30 - 7:30 which were both great and was a great addition. We had a fantastic stay and when I return to Bangkok, this will be the hotel we will stay. Right on the river for easy access to Grand Palace etc.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
63,3.0,As an old avid SPG loyalist and being the second time in Bangkok really wanted to try this hotel out for the most part because the river views looked awesome! As the days were getting nearer there were some very competitive rates in the city and almost cancelled and tried a more modern property........but I just wanted that river view!We arrived and were able to get into our room immediately - we were also upgraded to a Junior Suite I believe. A gentleman in Thai wardrobe accompanied us to our room. He was a little odd to say the least and wasn't sure what to take of him from the start.The entrance to the hotel is not really grand - it just shows up all of a sudden from a back street. It almost felt like we were entering it from a back lane or something?We entered the room and YIKES it screamed 80's!! Older wood furniture; carpet; the old master light switch that we couldn't figure out; old phone on the wall by the toilet; only one place to put one suitcase the other had to go on a chair or find a piece of furniture; shower was super small and leaked like crazy as the door did not seal; only a wand shower that had absolutely no pressure; old sink and that is it - we had to put any toiletries into the bathtub as there was no place whatsoever to put stuff; room safe was put into an existing drawer that was not big enough so when opening it up you had to hold it open and ensure the drawer did not slide to slam it down?They do have a decent club lounge; very large and staffed very well; we did enjoy this for breakfast and some snacks/drinks in the evening - it does get very busy!We were hoping for a lounge//bar to just sit outside and enjoy drinks along the river but they only had an indoor lobby lounge. We spent time at both pools - the upper pool is fairly basic with loungers surrounding the pool that are very close to each other. The lower pool has trees and feels more relaxing and enjoyed the pool bar down there.I really wanted to like this place and it is in a dire need of renovations! There are so many other SPG/MAR choices in Bangkok that are very competitively priced with a much more modern feel. I think the price point at his place also attracts a little different clientele? I've been looking at this property for years and finally stayed but unfortunately on my next visit to Bangkok I will have to choose something else. It's big and old with not much around it and unfortunately not many areas to be sitting riverside other than the one restaurant in which the menu did not entice us to visit.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
64,5.0,This place is great. On the river across from IconSiam mall. They even have a water taxi to get you there. Our 2nd visit to this Sheraton and still completely satisfied. Pet at the front desk on the midnight shift was very helpful. Breakfast buffet offered many choices for everyone!,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
65,5.0,"Stayed here for a few nights while visiting Bangkok for leisure. We stayed in a club-level room and the hotel was perfect for our visit! We were doing all of the “touristy” things in Bangkok, and the location of this hotel to the river to catch the ferry boat is great! The hotel also has a free ferry across the river to a large shopping mall. Our room was great, we were on a high floor the faced the river - excellent views!! The club lounge was convenient. We had the continental breakfast there each morning, and enjoyed pre-dinner cocktails there a couple times. The staff was helpful and attentive. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
66,5.0,"We pre booked a premium deluxe room requesting an up river view. Also that the room was pre air conditioned before arrival and that ice and fresh milk were on hand. All was done perfectly. Service and check in were excellent. Buffet breakfast consistently good all mornings. Staying here really made our holiday and the good thing was that service and quality were consistent across days and staff rotations. I found the room clean,comfortable and quiet as the river boats and music closed down by 10.30 latest. A definite recommend. Sheraton are delivering their brand well here.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

68,5.0,"We stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay. We were in room 1022 and had beautiful view overlooking the river. The room was very large, with floor to ceiling windows. It was well lit and had reading lights. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom had a large mirror that was well lit, a high bathtub with a hand held shower. But beware of scalding - the hot water is VERY hot. All amenities were provided, with a safe, huge TV having many channels, desk with light.There was a stuffed sitting chair also. The hotel lobby and other areas were very nicely appointed. We had breakfast each day and it was a nice variety. The location is great, with free ferries to take you across the river to the large mall across the way.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
69,3.0,Stayed here one night with friends during a cruise Bedrooms are excellent great mattresses and pillows Fantastic view from 24th floorBeware of prices Everything including rooms carries a 10% service charge and TaxA bottle of wine that I would pay £8 for at home in England was about £100 or £20 a glass Service in bar and restaurant was poor with surprisingly little English spoken for a five star hotel Over all disappointing ,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
70,4.0,"Stayed for three nights prior to travelling back to UK. Wonderful location right by the river. Our suite had floor to ceiling windows  which allowed for great views in both directions  of all the river traffic. Many boats are lit up at night and adds to a great  evening vibe. There is a free shuttle boat that takes you to a shopping complex called Iconsiam. Shopping wise the outlets are pretty much the same as any major city but for foodies and anyone interested in buildings/ feats of engineering it is quite something. Many street vendors and food outlets are a short walk from the hotel.Our room was a little tired and the damaged flooring and iron mark in the carpet was the first thing we noticed on arrival. It did not detract from a comfortable  stay however. The bed was so inviting and delightful  it was a struggle getting out of it in the mornings. Breakfasts are good and with so much variety.The Lounge was very popular and on two occasions was full and we were unable to find a place to sit. The evening happy hours are, i would suggest too short to accommodate every guest who takes drinks before dinner. The two swimming pools are lovely and I even had a roving peacock come up and say hello, thankfully before the awful din they make!!Staff very efficient and welcoming.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

The staff is so kind and friendly, the room is really big with the most comfortable bed ever! We had the best view looking at the river, and the breakfast was just amazing! There was plenty of food to choose, and the restaurant near the river was just beyond the words. The best lobster we ever tried!Also, there were two swimming pools, so we could choose which one do we like the most, and we had amazing time there, drinking some cocktails and enjoying the quiet time, just relaxing. I can’t wait to come back again, because this is my favorite hotel in Bangkok!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

Impeccable cleanliness, exemplary service, friendly concierge - make the hotel attractive to many individual tourists and groups. Rooms with river views are especially attractive.  The hotel restaurant surprises with its variety of international and Thai cuisine.

75,5.0,"Just stayed here for 6 nights. Wonderful hotel. Great location by the river with free boat to Iconsiam. Really enjoyed Club lounge and Riverview restaurant. View from room on 28th floor was great also. By far the best thing about my stay was the Garden Pool with the Peacocks. They were so entertaining to watch. Very unusual sitting on a sun lounger and all of a sudden a peacock walks past you!!! Brilliant and very unique!! The staff are all lovely and really nice too particularly in the pool bar. The service is very speedy too. Hotel room, grounds and facilities are excellent. As a solo traveler I felt completely safe the entire time here. Hotel is joined to ferry terminal so very convenient to go on evening river cruise from here. Also next door is public taxi boat that takes you to attractions eg. Wat Arun, Khao San Rd. (Ticket is less than 50p!). The entrance is in between the hotels 2 pools so couldn’t be closer really! Will definitely visit again soon. Thanks for a wonderful stay ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
76,4.0,"The hotel is in a great location right by the river. The hotel shuttle runs every half hour across the river to the Iconsiam & then down to the Skytrain Station. At the Iconsiam you can pick up the hop on hop off ferries to all the riverside attraction. Travelling on the river is probably the fastest way to get around Bangkok.The hotel itself is pleasant enough although the rooms are a little bit tired. However, all your needs are catered for toiletries, tea & coffee etc. The towel are amazing really soft & fluffy not like some of the thread bare ones supplied in some hotels. My husband in Coeliac and they had gluten free cereals & bread available at the breakfast buffet. If we visited Bangkok again, which I seriously doubt I would stay at this hotel again.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
77,4.0,All rooms have wonderful river views. Excellent comfy beds. Good size rooms. Restaurants right on the river although a little pricey. Breakfast with huge choice but food was only ever luke warm. Very useful river shuttle to the Skytrain and Iconsiam shopping centre. Excellent street food at front on hotel. Easy and interesting walk to China town,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
78,5.0,"We stayed at this hotel for our last night in Thailand. We wish that we would have spent a couple days in Bangkok. The hotel offers a complimentary boat shuttle to the designer mall across the river and to a major boat taxi stop. China town is a short walk - we enjoyed the street vendors and outdoor market. We didn't make it to the neighboring jewelry stores before 5pm but heard from other hotel guests that there were some good prices. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating they even called us a taxi for our 4am trip to the airport. The only con we have is the shower - the temperature fluctuates from burn your skin, to cold, to back to your set temperature.  But we would definitely stay here again on our next trip!","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
79,4.0,"Service and quality is what you would expect with Sheraton.  Situated on the river Chao Phraya and not far away from Chinatown, this hotel has a very convenient location.  Multiple places to dine and a free boat shuttle are all nice touches as was the very accommodating staff.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
80,4.0,"The hotel is beautifully situated at the shores of Chao Phraya river. It has its own quay and bout that takes you over to the new chopping centre ICONSIAM on the opposite side of the river and a little down the river to the sky train station. About one 100 meters from the hotel is the communal quay that is frequented by several boats and boat lines. This is also a small shopping centre with many antique and art dealers among others. All the rooms have a river view due to the very smart layout of the building with only the corridor windows heading to the city. The junior suits that are on the club levels, from 17 and up, are spacious with a living room and a bedroom and places to put your clothes and other stuff. The bathroom is also pretty large with a good shower area and also with a bathtub for traditionalists. They are probably a tiny number nowadays. However, the furniture and the carpet look old and not very attractive. This together with the carpets in corridors and other public areas devalue somewhat the impression of the hotel and should be updated. Otherwise the hotel looks good and lives up to its five-star level in the lobby, restaurants, the gym and pool area. The club levels have a own dining room at the 27th floor for breakfast and drinks in the late afternoon. When you also can get a lot of different snacks together with your drink. Very nice indeed, so I do recommend picking one of these rooms. One very important quality of this hotel is their staff. They are plentiful, competent, helpful and very nice.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
81,5.0,"Great stay and upgrade to club level (27th floor) floor with lounge access.Free boar shuttle every 30 min to Iconic Siam Mall across the river, plenty of food options. Chinatown is walkeable from the hotel. We went to see the Golden Buddha there. Hotel food was good, the restaurant dining options looked great but we didn't get to try it. Plenty of free water, spacious rooms, comfy bed and large TV. Great river / city view from our room.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
82,4.0,We have been visited Sheraton hotel the hotel was nice and good maintained. This hotel included with two Salt Swimming pool and we would like to recommend for business group will be better. Here have complementary boat service to shopping mall & BTS train station nearby. But unfortunately the hotel area is not good So Noise all day & night the smelly for the river was not good. The stay period we had to early check out due to this problem and staff can not do anything to make you comfortable to stay even we informed to them twice time until we decided to early check out. Thank you to provide beautiful hotel for take a wonderful photo ,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
83,4.0,"By the river Chao Phraya and not far away from Chinatown, this hotel has a very convenient location.As with many Sheraton Hotels around the world, a partial renovation would improve, but the price is right for Bangkok at it current stage.A very good option to be close to the lively river and with a complimentary shuttle river to Sapan Taksim to catch the BTS (elevated mass rail transport).","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
84,2.0,"I’ve stayed at this particular hotel many times in the past and despite it being a bit old I’ve always enjoyed it. Also it hold some sentimental value to me. However, It’s just not very good anymore and next time I’ll try something else (eg Shangri-la where I stayed two weeks ago which is so much better or something newer). Since I stayed at Sheraton Orchid last time (1 year ago) it’s just declined in terms of standard, service, quality etc. Overall just not a great experience. Here are few of my experiences to back up the claim:1. Made an order through room service. After an hour nothing! I then called room service only to be told off that they had never received an order from me. Then I spoke to the manager and the order came 15 mins later. What I received was just horrible. Cold, tasteless and what was supposed to be a spaghetti carbonara was just spaghetti with cream pored on top. I sent it back and left it at that. See pic. 2. Speed of service at the pool is ridiculous. On two occasions I waited 15 mins (kid you not) before they came and took my order despite having had eye contact with them. Sometimes the staff is nowhere to be seen and you’re just sat there. I’ve also gone up and asked for service only to be sat there waiting again. If the staff would just walk around and make sure everything is in order and if guests have what they need they will make a lot more money. 3. Had a drink at the outside bar. I received a drink filled with rotten mint leaves. I obviously raised this but there was not much response and it was just left there. Finally, the hotel just seems a bit dirty overall. I know it’s a bit old but it just seems a bit miss kept - beyond the point where it’s just the old charm.I really think the management needs to get their house in order and bring this hotel back to its high standards. They are really not doing much for the brand and it’s global reputation. ","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
85,5.0,"I’ve been bangkok several times but It’s my first time to visit this hotel. I liked this hotel very much. Excellent breakfast food quality, convenient free shuttle, big shopping mall nearby, perfect riverside view and more.Also the lounge staff was very nice  and they asked me about my needs and filled them in every time. One thing I want is that official Facebook messages or official email replies are slow","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
86,5.0,We've been here 4 times in the past 20 years and it is still as good as ever. Location on the river right next to a boat stop. We love travelling up and down the river on the boat busses. 15 baht each and great fun.We've stayed on the club floor every time and sipping cocktails on the 27th floor watching the sun set on the river is still a magical experience. Prices remarkably good. Two lovely swimming pools by the river. Only negative is hotel restaurants typically expensive with bland food. But a couple of decent places just outside and taxis very cheap to get around in. ,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
87,5.0,My husband and I stayed at Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel for 2 nights as a part of Luxury Escape package.It took 30 minutes from the airport.(8pm)The staff was very polite and friendly. The room was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was dated but a staff told us that they are expecting to have renovations in the near future. Hopefully they can update all the bathrooms.The dinner at Thara Thaong was very nice!The complimentary boat services were very good. We didn’t use any transports on land.I wish we could have stayed a couple of more nights and spent more time around Bangkok.We would recommend Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel to our friends and family!,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
88,3.0,"We have been travelling to BKK for some 30 years and have stayed at the Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel numerous times during this time.We absolutely love being on the river and have shared many holidays with family and friends here, as well as travelling just as a couple.  The old staff are always welcoming and genuinely interested in how you have been.  However, we have never witnessed such a steady decline in service as this hotel has over the past five or so years.We used to receive a personal letter from the Manager welcoming us “home” - gone.We used to receive a fruit bowl with lovely tropical fruit - gone.  In May last year we received 2 apples and in December 3 bananas!We used to receive a certain amount of complimentary laundry each day - gone.Children weren’t allowed in the Club Lounge during cocktail hour- gone.  We went to the lounge one day to organise transport and were shocked at the amount of children with their families who appeared to have taken over.  I thought this was supposed to be an oasis for quiet respite.We were given a photocopied piece of paper with the lounge rules on it and were advised that strict dress rules applied during cocktail hour.  We knew these rules already and have always respected them.  We noted that children were now allowed in the lounge but not in the bar area.  Well I’m sorry, during our stay EVERY night there were underdressed people and children (in the bar area).  It may have been the Xmas/New Year holiday break and you were busy,  but rules are rules.  Two lounges were operating during this time.  We went to Level 26 where there was a definite lack of seating for guests.  It is grossly unfair to expect paying adults to stand with a drink in one hand and a plate in the other and somehow manage to enjoy themselves.  It was noticed that no Senior Management entered this area during our stay.  I would probably avoid the very unhappy guests too.Having said that, we had dealings with Tang (Rooms Manager) who was very professional and understanding.Our Suite was well appointed but I have to say, in much need of a refurbishment.  We have been saying for about ten years now “surely they will start renovating soon”.  The hotel desperately is in need of an upgrade.  Having said that, the room was very clean.Watching the river with the night lights on is mesmerising.We had breakfast mainly at Feast.  The choice is extensive and well presented.  This restaurant also is in great need of renovating.  The only thing I didn’t enjoy about Feast at breakfast time was the noise due to the amount of people.  Sadly, the poor decor and noise made it feel like a budget cafeteria.  There only appears to be three long standing staff members who show genuine excitement at seeing you again.  We are grateful for that.  The other staff show no interest in their job and on three occasions I asked questions (could you please ask someone to look at the toaster), (is there a Sunday Brunch this weekend) & (can I please see the wine list) - all with the same response - “okay” but no action?I must say, we usually avoid hotels that encourage to large tour groups in buses.  These groups tend to overrun the lobby and dining areas.  The ROSH does accommodate these groups but appears to segregate them at breakfast, but the groups still seem to block walkways in the lobby areas with total disregard to fellow guests.We have become increasingly disappointed in the blasé way guests are now being treated.  We have been in business (albeit small business), but we were always grateful for customers who showed loyalty.  We certainly acknowledge their loyalty and show gratitude.  You are in the hospitality game but have let this lapse.  This is your game - you need to get it right.We use the hotel car for airport transfers, we use the restaurants and bars at the hotel and we use the laundry facilities every day at the hotel.We must thank people like Nimmit and all the staff at the door, Ice and the ladies in the lounge, Tuk at Feast and Sithichon who always comes and says hello when he knows we are there.  These are the people that keep us coming back.We were talking to another hotel manager upon our return who said when these things start happening you may need to upgrade your choice of hotel - perhaps he is right.  What used to be an excellent hotel is not so good anymore.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
89,1.0,"This hotel gives the Sheraton brand a bad name, disgusting service from the front desk staff, i had booked a room facing the river side on New years eve through a third party website with a pay at hotel option, at first the hotel did not want to honor the booking and said they were fully booked even though we had a confirmed booking and then finally after the third party website pushed them they gave us the room and charged me the full price immediately, even though it was supposed to be payed at the hotel in local currency on the day of check in, i called the hotel and talked to the manager who said they can do what they want as its the third party website's fault to mention that its cancellable and pay at hotel, as i had already planned to stay i didn't make an issue about it and confirmed with the staff that my room was river facing and facing the Icon Siam mall as i was planning to stay with my family including a small toddler and wanted to see the fireworks from our window in order to avoid the crowds, they confirmed i would have a view of it and that was the end of it.When i arrived at the hotel our nightmare began, the hotel was chaotic, as i was in line i could already sense things will not go as planned, when i reached the check in counter i was told they were no rooms available facing the firework and i would be put in a room facing the other direction, i tried to reason with them but they became aggressive and started talking rudely and called us liars , the behaved extremely bad with me and my wife due to which we lost our temper , the manager at the front desk should honestly be fired, she was the most unprofessional and rude individual i have ever come across at any hotel and these type of people should not be hired in the first place, i will not lower myself and mention her name on here but the management knows exactly who i am referring to. At the end of it me, my wife and our little child stood there for almost 2 hours, fighting with these people, who disrespected us, talked rude in front of other guest and didn't even try to help or compensate us in anyway , a simple, im sorry sir we don't have a room available that you requested but we can give you an upgrade, or a free night stay voucher or anything would have been a nice enough gesture, but they didnt care or bother.At the end of it we demanded a refund and the hesitantly gave it to us to get us out of their hotel as they didn't want the other guest to see the truth regarding this unprofessional property,  the only people that were civilized to talk to were their senior manager who was a lady and their main hotel manager who was a foreigner, even for them they did not offer any apologies or anything and tried to protect their staff who had treated us so badly.The only people i will compliment would be the bell boys who were nice and quick and helped us to get out of that terrible place quickly.if there was a rating worse than 0 i would have given it, i hope this review is read by the management and action is taken from the HQ of Sheraton, i have already emailed the head office of Sheraton and also reported this property and these individuals to the relevant authorities in Thailand.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
90,5.0,Had a two night stay at the Sheraton. The room was clean and modern while the view of the riverside was simply awesome. Sat at night simply watching the world go by and then realising I simply must get some sleep !!! Staff were amazing and helpful. Breakfast buffet was very good with lots of variety. We ate late on arrival at the lounge bar on the ground floor and the food was averagely priced as well as the drinks for such a high class hotel. The grounds were very nice and although being in central downtown Bangkok the swimming pool Area and gardens are a oasis of calm and relaxation. We had a great stay also the shuttle boat is handy every half hour to cross the river to the Siam shopping centre and then onward to the nearest sky train station. The hotel is also conveniently located by the pier for the river boat taxi to get around town via the river.,"Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
91,5.0,"Wouldn't hesitate to stay here next time in Bangkok.View of the river is great always something to watch. One side of the hotel is the river taxi pier. The hotel has it's own free courtesy launch every half hour from 10.00 am which takes you across the river to the very large new shopping centre Icon Siam (great food stalls in the lower level) and to the nearest metro station. The sound,light and water show outside the Icon Siam in the evening is brilliant and free.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
92,3.0,"We have travelled to Bangkok numerous times and habe stayed in many of Bangkoks 5 Star Hotels such as Shangri La, Peninsula, different Anantara Hotels etc. Having stayed at the Sheraton for three nights we have to conclude that this hotel cannot be claiming 5 Stars compared to what other Bangkok hotels have to offer. The Sheraton seems to cater mainly for Chinese Tour Groups, thus the guests are not in a 5 Star range. The hotel ambiance is overall middleclass, lobby more a Tourist-Mall ambiance, rooms and public areas are worn and shabby, so are the pool areas. Do not get me wrong: If you are expecting a 3.5 Star hotel you will be happy, but if you have ever experienced true 5 Star hospitality in one of the many truely fabulous Bangkok hotels you will end up very disaoppointed. Breakfast quality is mediocre, the whole atmosphere is rushed, noisy and not relaxing at all. Sorry dear hotel management, but please visit Shangri La next door or any of the Anantara properties to see how things should be done if claiming a 5 Star rating. The only positive: the Staff does it‘s utmost to cope with all the downsides and have always been lovely.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
93,5.0,"The Royal Orchard Sheraton delivers everything you would expect from an international chain. Large room, comfortable bed and good service.  The breakfast is a huge international buffet and can be enjoyed outside on the terrace or inside.  There are 2 pools, good for cooling off after a day's sightseeing.  The hotel is walking distance from Chinatown and next door to a jetty where the river taxis stop so easy access to the main old city sites and also the leisure complex downstream.  The hotel has a free shuttle service linking it, the shopping mall IconSiam and the BTS station. An e all rooms have a river view, river taxis and long tail boats during the day and the brightly lit party boats at night. I got a special deal which made it worth staying in a 5 star hotel but the best really was the access to the river and the ease of getting around.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
94,4.0,"The Royal Orchid Sheraton boasts of great views over the river, proximity to the boat pier, and a fantastic selection of fruits.Unfortunately, the check-in at the lounge (for Bonvoy guests) takes a long time (I prefer speedier 2-minute check-ins at reception), and there is a lot of noise at night from outside that gets into my room, but management informed me that they're renovating the hotel to reduce the noise.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5
95,4.0,"Last time I was here was almost 15 years ago and I remembered the luxurious rooms and facilities. Now I'm back again and the rooms are very well kept, the pools are awesome,i think there's one new one since I was here last time.They now have one fresh water pool and one salt water pool.The fresh water pool is full of kids and flies as there's no wind here, but the saltwater pool has neither and is a great tranquil place to be.Sound proofing in the room isn't the best so if you're a light sleeper and want to sleep in you might be woken up in the morning.Hotel staff is awesome, except for the lack of smiles in the bar downstairs they all were very smiling and service minded.I would give the hotel a full score if it hadn't been for my shower being moody, it changed between scolding hot to ice cold so there was no relaxation there. I was constantly alert as I was suddenly in a siberian ice bath and a few seconds later I was in the hot springs of costa rica. I told the hotel through the Marriott app and they said they'd send someone to look at it but there was no difference the next day, same moody shower.I will definitely stay here again, given the shower is fixed.","Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel & Towers, Bangkok",4.5

I feel they're not welcome since we arrived. We were there early than the check-in time but I called them already and a lady said she will prepare a room for us. I did a check-in process with bell boy(registor) and gsa ask me to take a seat and wait for the room. Then we wait for 15-20 mins which is fine for us cuz we know that we arrive early. Then we got the key, went to our room and while we were relaxing the housekeeper try to open the room door with only one knock and open it immediately but we use a double lock inside so she couldn't get in and realize that guests are in the room. We were shocked, my partner open the door and saw she walk away without any apologise. He called her and asked why did she try to open the door. She said she thought this is vacant room and she need to inspection it and say sorry. (I thought she inspected it since we wait at the lobby, So what did we waited for?) This is not our first time that the staff here try to open our room door. Last time we asked for late check-out with front desk but a housekeeper try to open our door at 12PM and asked for the check-out time. Why? and also about calling guest to check-out. The check-out time is at 12 PM. Why you guys have to call us at 11 and half? One last thing. I checked the price for upgrade my room by call and facebook chat the price are not the same.

Also on first day housekeeping didn't set up hand towels and have only body towels. Bed is comfortable however rooms are not soundproof. Our next door neighbors were watching TV late in the evening and in the morning. You can hear every word from TV in other room. How it is possible for 4 star hotel?Breakfast was more like a mess than experience. Choices are subpar. Variety of of food more remind me of 3 star hotel. Waffles station. You need to make waffles by yourself. Egg Station when I came was unattended. Only one good thing is coffee machine. It is nice but also not properly set up as latte need to be served in tall glass however near machine don't have any long glasses and then you press latte it will just give small shot of coffee.Location of hotel is fine. 7-11 is nearby.

In regards to all this we decided to write to the hotel two weeks before our journey to ask if we could change the date of our arrival we didn’t want a refund but simply a change of date however the hotel did not fulfil  our request as it did not think the pandemic was anything different and it said it operated as usual. We are extremely disappointed with the decision of the hotel as this is the only hotel that didn’t take our request on board and accepted our proposal but the other two we contacted we didn’t have a problem with rearranging the date. The hotel is clearly more interested in building profits rather than taking care of the customers. Please choose wisely before booking.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

They were very ""surprised"" to hear that I want to change the linen ""so late"". I waited 30 minutes for somebody to come and had to call them a few times. A guy came to change the linen. I left the room for a while. Later I found out that my international charger worth 40 euro disappeared... They are supposed to refund any loss up to 5000 Bahts. but they did not give me anything. They said that the cleaning staff say they did not take anything... Of course, what else should the staff say? I had to lock all belongings all the time when I was leaving room. Plus - I had very noisy neighbours, the TV was on all the time until 2 am. When I called to the reception the first night the female receptionist called to the room and they switched it off. The next night I had to call to the reception again at 11.30 pm as I could not sleep due to the noise. They said they would call them. Nothing was happening. I had to call to the reception again. They said they would send somebody to tell them. Nobody was coming. I went to the reception. There were 2 male receptionist. One of them pretended not to see me and did not greet me. The other one said the Thai ladies are watching a movie and want to finish it!! And if it disturbs me I can move to another room!! EVERYTHING is heard from one room to another.

49,5.0,"I do recommend the quarter Ari by UHG. This was my second visit in a month. It was a really pleasant stay. The room and the view were super amazing. I got upgraded my room to be two-bed-room suite. For the couple travelers, I totally recommend this room. You got the bathtub with the spectacular view of Bangkok. The bathroom was huge, clean, and new. I gave extra point on the big mirror in the bathroom. I loved this place and I will totally come back. The breakfast was also great, various choices and located on the 22 second floor, breakfast with a view literally. Rooftop pool can beat all the five-star hotels in bangkok; you will get all the 180 view of bangkok and it was real relaxing. The staff here is super friendly especially Nat, she is helpful and also the manager. 10 out of 10 on the staff!! I mean, book it you will never regret to stay here on your holiday!","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

The view of the whole town in the upper floors is breathtaking, the crew helps and is very nice, the sky pool literally pours on the city, the rooms are large and make immediately yourself at home. We wish we could stay longer!","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
63,4.0,"We chose this hotel as we arrived at night at Don Muang airport and departed from Suvarnabhumi the next night. For us it was important to have 24 hrs access/reception and closeness to the BTS.Our room was on 32nd floor and we had a nice view over Bangkok. As we were given an upgrade we had a kitchenette, a living room, a bed room and a balcony. The room was clean and there was a lot of storage space, most probably for business guest staying a little longer than us. We did not have the breakfast, but heard it was good. There was a pool on the roof, which had a nice size and a good view over Bangkok. I like the area of Ari as there are nice (hidden) bars, restaurants and coffee places and it's good to hang out for a day or two. I wouldn't want to stay at the hotel for a whole holiday but for one or two nights, especially when in transit, it's great. The hotel is located in the top floors of an office building and there are various cafés, a 24 hr 7Eleven and a Boots downstairs.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
64,5.0,"Modern, spacious and clean room with panoramic views of the surrounding area. Good location - around 10 minutes walk to Ari BTS station, and a further 20 mins to the city by BTS. It was around 30 mins from the airport by taxi. Good WiFi and pleasant breakfast also in a nice room with good views. Staff were always courteous and helpful. Malls and street food not too far away - with spas/restaurants. Some parts of Ari neighborhood are quite hipster with a nice vibe. The hotel is far enough away from the crowds but close enough to the city center.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
65,5.0,"The Quarter Ari is a gorgeous property and offers breathtaking views from both the rooms and rooftop swimming pool. My room was quite spacious; it even had a larger-than-expected mini fridge and microwave (perfect for leftovers and stocking up on ice cream from the 7-11 downstairs). I loved the whole modern look and feel, and it reminded me of a lot of hotels in New York City, but much bigger and for only a fraction of the price. Ari is a pretty fun area to explore with lots of cute cafes and restaurants. I really enjoyed the Tell a Story restaurant around the corner that had a local band playing and showed movies outside. I was only at the Quarter Ari for two nights, but would have loved to stay much longer. ","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
66,4.0,"We were there for 3 nights with 2 year old, we liked our stay. Pool and gym areas are very good. Breakfast was ok, we are vegetarians so it was little boring for us. Location is not that good, but luckily there is bts station near. Taxi to city centre took about 30-60min. ","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
67,5.0,"I was recommended this hotel by a friend who visited Thailand the year before me and loved it. I stayed two nights at this hotel: my first and last nights in Thailand (three weeks apart). I couldn't have stayed at a better place to start and finish my trip. The staff is incredibly nice and the hotel facilities are great. The pool is on the smallish side but I haven't had the time to use as I was out and about exploring BKK. The views you get of the city are incredible and the location of the hotel is really good too - about 8-10 minutes walks from the Ari BST station meaning that it is very easy to get to the hotel from any of the two airports by public transport. I had a small issue with my booking where I was sent to the wrong room after check in, it didn't bother me at all but I then received a fruit platter as an apology. So sweet :)","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
68,5.0,"The Quarter Hotel is an excellent hotel. Major positive features are the location (only ~8 min walk to Ari BTS station which gets you into downtown Bangkok quickly and easily, but also to Chatuchak Market in 2 stops) the modern quiet rooms, the swimming/fitness facilities, and quality breakfast. I would definitely be happy to stay here again.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
69,5.0,"Our family stopped here for a layover and we were not disappointed. Wonderful location (walking distance from Ari stop, take exit 4 and it’s on the same side of the road). Only 6 minute metro ride to Mo Chit which is walking distance to Chatuchuk market (about 100 meters from Mo Chit stop).  The staff are super friendly and helpful, and the rooftop pool and the gym really nice. Rooms are spacious and large comfortable beds. Breakfast has many options and is nice. Would highly recommend this location as there are many things around and it’s close to the green line of the BTS.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
70,4.0,"The Quarter Hotel Ari is located on the 22-34th floors of an office tower in a residental/business area of Bangkok. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from Ari Skytrain station and 2 stops from the famous Chatuchak Weekend Markets.The Quarter Hotel has become very well known by Instantgrammers for the amazing views from the 34th floor swimming pool, particularly during sunset. The infinity pool is smallish and only has room for approximately 15 sun loungers so it can be a busy and not very relaxing experience. The Instantgrammers I encountered there were selfish and rude, not considering any other pool users in their quest for the perfect shot. It appeared to be a fashion photo shoot all the time, with swimsuit-clad women in full makeup and preened men strutting and flexing.I booked a deluxe room which was located on a corner and had expansive views across Bangkok. The bedroom was huge and the bathroom with full length windows gave a distraction while bathing. I particularly liked the kitchenette which had a three-quarter size fridge, microwave and crockery, cutlery and glasses. The amenities allowed me to purchase the amazing and famous Thai street food and enjoy it in the room if I desired.I only had a few interactions with staff and they seemed nice, though not overly friendly. I did encounter staff in the lifts and on my floor but sometimes there was no greeting which I find unusual for staff in a Thai hotel. Maybe a lil' more training and encouragement will give the staff the confidence to be more interactive.While the Quarter Hotel Ari is not a downtown hotel, the Ari area has everything you would need. Supermarkets, restaurants, spa treatments and so much more are at the doorstep of this hotel and I really enjoyed the local feel.If you're a poser, then The Quarter Hotel Ari is for you. If you're not, still stay in this hotel and go to the pool and SPLASH hard.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

75,1.0,"Our team are currently working on a long time project in Bangkok and have selected Quarter by Ari as a potential hotel to stay in. This was the second week I stayed at Quarter by Ari and again was hugely disappointed. 1) There were building works and constant drilling in the middle of the night from the moment I went into my room at approx 11pm at night.2) I called the hotel reception several times to fix the issue however there was no answer after several calls. 3) When they finally picked up they sent someone to the room who said they will fix the noise and tell the technicians to stop - this didn’t happen.4) Called reception again to complain yet the drilling continued for over an hour after past midnight. The hotel was doing building works in the middle of the night when this is clearly a time when guests are sleeping. This is shocking for any hotel and especially for a 4 star hotel which prides itself for being a business hotel. The hotel is new and in a good location in Ari, however I am hugely disappointed at the maintenance and service of the hotel. The rooms are not well cleaned and maintained. Towels are dirty and yellow. Other areas of improvement - the hotel should also consider extending their room service past 10pm which is very early. Overall, this hotel needs a lot of improvement to its service and maintenance if it wants to keep its 4 star status.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

78,4.0,"I was suggested this hotel by a friend who lived in the area and was told it was the best to stay at in the area and although I can't make a valid argument for or against that I was overall pleased with the hotel. Pros: this hotel was kept very clean and the staff I interacted with knew enough of my native language to properly communicate as I'm still a little new to the local language, I never got to the pool or the fitness center but the complimentary drinks were a nice touch and the green voucher incentive was nice to see as well, I saw in the lobby there was an attraction board for tourists who weren't sure what to do or go see. The staff was friendly and didn't hesitate to help me when I asked for it.Cons: There was a little confusion with my booking and I almost wasn't able to secure a ride from the airport to the hotel as provided, I did manage to get the ride but the driver seemed to be in a rush and was driving recklessly at least to my initial observation, I later learned that's just how people drive in Bangkok but it was not a pleasant experience.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

It was mostly asian and for western jetlagged people fried noodles in the morning is something we are not used to.Reception was okay, not extremely friendly, but kept reminding us what we have to pay.Mini bar had only complimentary water, nothing else.Room was spotless clean and big - we had an apartment overlooking the city and it was very nice.I would recommend it, but for what we've paid you can get a better hotel more central and probably will be cheaper!","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

91,3.0,"I have mixed review about this hotel really. Yes its rates are keenly priced. Its signature roof-top pool (and gym) is definitely the wow-factor that’s on par with some of the others top-rated hotels in Bangkok. But I think that’s where its attractiveness ends.   This might be a new hotel (which is why I chose), but other than the reception lobby, restaurant and pool which looks closely related to the management photos, the core function of a hotel – room standard and its services – are just extremely basic. The room décor is nothing fancy and yet it’s also of poor quality – it certainly feels more hostel than hotel and hence its competitive rate reflects. We booked a “premier suite” which is nothing too premier except it comes with a living room and on top floor with good view. The bathroom is not the cleanest as one should expect. The biggest problem however, is the total lack of sound proofing one should expect from a hotel stay. We could hear noises from upstairs (gym/bar) and next door throughout the night and traffic noises below even with windows shut.   The breakfast is just adequate and it can get a little chaotic when busload type of tourists arrive, the only good thing is the view you get.   Overall this is probably a hotel that fits perfectly for a budget traveller and who doesn’t expect too much but unfortunately it is not for us.

Breakfast was delightful and open from 6.30 to 10.30am. Outside there were plenty of shops. Brilliant value for money and very family friendly. Youngsters would adore the pool and choice of food and drink and adults would appreciate the hospitality, relatively low cost and other amenities, including easy access to the city’s amazing malls, temples and river cruises.

Management don’t care, we got complementary dinner as apology and when we went to have a dinner from a list of 50 foods only 10 available. For this amount of money definitely not worth to stay and we really don’t recommend. The hotel actually ruined our last days spent in Thailand.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
99,3.0,"Stayed for 2 nights.  Hotel on paper is fantastic but management is clearly not up to the job.  The whole hotel had no hot water for the complete day.  What made it frustrating was the complete lack of communication and lack of management staff on site to deal with such a major issue.  The manager Ms Tommy was nowhere to be seen after numerous requests.  Finally we were told she had gone to head office for a meeting leaving the poor front desk staff to deal with the problems!  There wasn't one manager available to make or take any decisions, we found this very strange.  A reputable hotel would have at least contacted each guest and even offered some kind of compensation even if it's a free drink.  The manager never did contact us before we checked out and I doubt she spoke to any of the other guests.  Very poor.  It's a shame as the hotel has good facilities, just let down by poor management.","The Quarter Ari by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

We opted for daily breakfast which is delivered to your room Mon-Fri and then available buffet-style in the restaurant on the 2nd floor on weekends. It’s great breakfast and worth the price and convenience. The pool and bar on the 18th floor is awesome as well.The hotel is right next to a 7/11 which was super convenient for snacks for our kids. It is also conveniently located within walking distance from Mercuryville, Central World, Siam Paragon shopping centers as well as Lumphini Park and Erawan Shrine. The staff was incredibly sweet and accommodating, especially Naphat, who was always there to guide our Grab cars, answer our questions and suggest great places to visit closeby. Also worth mentioning is the Diora spa, a few steps outside the hotel. It is a bit more expensive but worth every penny for a luxurious massage or spa treatment.

9,4.0,"We recently stayed for one night as I wanted to take the kids to Harborland and the hotel was offering a promotion with free entry, along with room upgrade, early check in/ late check out and free meal for kids. It was a good promotion for the price. We had a two bedroom corner suite on the same floor as the pool which was very convenient. Being relatively new, the hotel is clean and modern with a stylish pool/ bar area. Breakfast was good, if a little limited, but the lunch we had was a little disappointing. Another downside was they only issued one room key and this stopped working a couple of hours before check out. It was quickly resolved, but not ideal when you’re trying to get your kids showered and changed after swimming,Staff were friendly and helpful. We’d definitely stay again if they ran a similar promotion, as the hotel is in a great location.",Sindhorn Midtown Hotel Bangkok,5.0

Later (5-10 mins), they sent someone to fix the issue which turned out that there were a problem with the wire as it was teared out of the digital panel of air-conditioned.So we came down just to see how long it took to finish fixing. We sat for a while then asked the front team to change the room for us.Honestly, other hotels would have offered to change to room right at the moment the guest tell them about the problem! as I believe there are rooms available.After got the new room, everything was good, amenities were in place.

First, the location on Sathorn road makes it pretty accessible to things. The sheer size of the hotel, at over 60 stories is pretty impressive. And the rooftop bars and restaurants are really hard to beat. The views from the rooms, and from the rooftop venues is really quite exceptional. Overall the experience here is good. You shouldn't be disappointed with a stay here. The hotel interiors are beginning to look a little dated, though. Not because they are worn out, but just because design trends have changed, and newer hotels reflect those changes.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Jim organised everything for me, where the best seats were for the proposal (table 61 upstairs, on the top deck in front of the beautiful Wat Arun), arranging a bottle of champagne, Flowers and getting a book on the boat secretly so that my Fiancé would not know.

27,3.0,"We booked this hotel at the last minute due to what we thought was a very competitive price for a 5 star hotel. Alas, having just stayed at the new Marriott Marquis on Sukhumvit Soi 22 and the Marriott  in Hua Hin, we realised how spoiled we had been in those new and fresh hotels.The Banyan Tree is set back off what is a very busy road, with not much close by.  It is surrounded by high rise office blocks, so not a particularly convenient or interesting location.  When driving into the hotel, you have to go behind the building that is on the road. When you get to the drop off area, it is very small, un-inviting and with no doorman waiting outside. At first, we thought we had inadvertently arrived at the service entrance to the hotel.The doorman, singular, was ok but not particularly friendly or welcoming. Check in was smooth and efficient.On going to the room on the 23rd floor, we noticed that the hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed properly. Some of the wall paper was peeling from the walls. On entering the room there was a damp smell. The room is quite tired, the TV is small and ancient. Initially, the TV didn't switch on when I pressed the power button on the remote. I had to actually find the power button on the TV itself, to then put it on standby, before the remote would work. The TV also looks ugly, with cables hanging down from under it, with an old and frayed cable tidy, and an ancient infra red mouse eye clumsily stuck onto the exterior of the screen. The channel choice is average, the wifi is adequate. The room comes with a coffee percolator, which is nice. However, housekeeping had not provided any of the coffee bags for it to work. However, when I called reception, these were provided quickly. Alas, the coffee was not to my taste anyway. The shower screen has not been cleaned properly, with smears on the glass.  The bed is comfortable, but the pillows are quite thick, so may not be to everyone's preference. They provided a small fruit plate in the room, and the minibar is quite well stocked with a good selection of spirits and wine/beer. In summary, with the huge choice of hotels in Bangkok, I would not stay here again.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

He even asked me if I would like to use washroom before depart from airport as the journey will take approx 40mins to hotel. So caring Next, I met K. Suthep, the limo driver. Another guy with a warm smile (even covered with mask) make me feel at ease. He checked on me to ensure that my whole journey is comfortable. He is very knowledgeable even just joined the company for 6 months. The whole journey is flawless. When I reach hotel lobby, the Front Office Manager K. Oat already waited me at the entrance, with welcome drinks & snacks. After having a cool chilling homemade welcome drinks, I was directly escorted to my room for in-room check in. WOW! WOW! WOW! The room was SUPERB! With a nice setup of welcome amenities (yummilicious snacks prepared by chef) & nicely printed photos in frames placed in the room. This make me feel really like my HOME. The team is so resourceful and pay attention to every single details to make me feel like home. I think they know that I have not back to my hometown for at least a year due to COVID-19 situation. So lovely! After a tiring day of travelling, K. Kanya, the spa therapist really make me whole body very relax. The 3 hours treatment was really FANTASTIC. Royal Banyan Spa Package really worth for a great experience. I even snooze off several time because it was too relax & his skills is really fabulous. After spa treatment, is dinner time! And i misssssss Hong Kong cuisine so much. I was craving for it for several months as I couldn't travel to Hong Kong. So I went to Baiyun Restaurant. Opps... I forget to make reservation and was fully booked  The hostess told me that I need to wait around 1.5hrs for the next table. After 30mins, the hostess called me that there is a table available. Yahoo... The waiters & waitresses have been very nice to me as I was dining alone. They keep on checking me if I like the food, the food is enough and etc. They recommended me all yummy food. Excellence service. Thanks to the chef too. Yummmmy dimsum Everyday I passby the lobby and met the Security & Concierge. They always greet me with a warm smile. I can feel it even they were wearing the mask. I can sense the warm & sincere greeting & care. Maybe this is the authentic Thai culture?

60,1.0,"We both have travelled a lot and have stayed at the Banyan Tree many years ago. Not a lot has changed in decoration and style. We booked a suite as it was a good promotion but the price is not the most important part for us, as that would be the experience and good service. (Days, weeks, months or years later people have forgotten about the price but the good memories or bad have not been forgotten)Lobby was ok (not a grand style) and looked fine but it was not cozy. We checked in and were given 2 keys and pointed to the elevators. We did not had many bags but the bell man sorted our bags out. He did not enter the room but that was ok. We were very disappointment by the room. The bedroom had NO WINDOW and was dark. The room was very cold and the colors in the room were not warm either. The ""sitting room"" was nothing special but it had a window, however the window was blocked! (When we asked another day if all the other rooms had the same the front desk lady answer no this is the only one that has a blocked view. Why we were given this room as the hotel was 98% empty? Does the customer experience not come first here? (As a Platinum card member I could have booked a cheaper room and have a free lounge with breakfast on top instead of booking a suite but never mind) The suite came with access to the club lounge. The lounge was closed and we were told to sit here at the Reception/ Check-in area where you can have some drinks. (WOW??) It did not make me feel special at all.  Drinks came with some snacks but they were not as expected. Snacks at the 7-11 were better. Mirco waved soft snacks that were supposed the be crispy. The lady was lovely and apologised. My partner felt sorry for her as she was embarrassed serving us these snacks. We booked for 2 nights, the next day we did not want to used the ""club lounge""anymore as we were quite happy to pay for our wines and food anywhere else. Breakfast was a la carte with baby size plates clearly not enough. I asked for some bread items but the came so later that we did not touch them. Banyan Tree if you give something then please give something nice and of good quality or nothing at all! Tip for your GM: Please visit the JW Marriott (close to you) and see what can be possible in these times. You will be amazed. Happy staff and happy guests in a busy breakfast lounge every day and a good working Club lounge. If you thing you can do it please do so otherwise leave it. Your customers will not be impressed with what you are offing now. (I am sure they all say that they do understand and so did we, but do not forget that we have a good choice of hotels to choose from!) I will not be coming back to this property!",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

69,3.0,"The hotel is set back of Sathon Tai road. Both BTS and MRT stations are located about 10-15 minutes walk away. Some convenience stores are located within few minutes of walking. Mr.Nueng from frontdesk provided a fast check-in process. Check-out was also smooth.My original purpose was to try their new Serenity Club Room, but it appears that they closed down some high floors during weekdays, so they put me in 2-bedroom suite which is located on lower floors instead. The suite was very spacious. It may be worth the upgrade, but it contradicts my original purpose.The suite was clean, but I spotted stain on carpet, sofa and chairs.Guest service was prompt and professional.Wi-Fi internet was extremely bad, weak signal, and was not stable throughout my stay. It was able to get only 1-6 Mbps in some parts of the room. This should not happens in a 5-star hotel. They should replace their ancient wireless access point (802.11g) to newer model and install more of them for better coverage.TVs in my suite were Smart TV, but I could not make use of any smart feature from them. The hotel should make a great improvement on their Wi-Fi and network, and put TVs onto the network, so that guests can enjoy own's content from their devices.Moon bar on the rooftop was provided good drinks with stunning view of Bangkok and attentive service.Overall it was a nice hotel with clean room, good amenities and great service, but the Wi-Fi was awful.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

We were very surprised and thankful to receive a room upgrade and nothing could have prepared us for the moment we opened the door of the room, it was breathtaking. Thank you to the front desk - you gave us a lifelong everlasting memory. Our stay was relatively short so we couldn't sample all the hotel has to offer (and didn't want to leave our delightful room) however we did take a trip to the rooftop Moon Bar and it really is a 'must do' as the views and the atmosphere were truly amazing.  It would be difficult to find fault with any aspect of our stay, so suffice to say we were extremely impressed with the staff, the room, the location and definitely the rooftop Moon Bar.

However the hotel went above and beyond to make us extremely comfortable not only due to their COVID19 management but also the Chief Concierge Mr. Jackie that we had the utmost pleasure to converse with during our stay. He gave us the most exciting recommendations for restaurant (that cater towards our very specific needs)as well as sights to visit that is off the beaten path, which in my opinion shows that his knowledge is very in-depth, personal and not taken out of your run of the mill guide book. Besides Mr. Jackie all the staff were very attentive and the hotel breath taking.

I can find a better buffet in any 3-star-hotel in BKK with 1/4 of full price.The cost of thb 1,799++ per pp is a real ripped off. They offer us 50% off after a big complain.

15,3.0,"The facilities and location of the Compass Skyview hotel in Bangkok are fantastic. The hotel is just minutes walk from the BTS, with links to the whole of the city. The hotel is equipped with a great rooftop pool, bars and restaurants, offering a wide range of cuisines.From our experience, the hotel sadly falls far short of its 5 star rating on the one thing that Thais are so famous for having in abundance: their hospitality.My wife and I recently stayed at the hotel on their very appealing “staycation” package that they are currently promoting to Thai nationals and residents, which is inclusive of all meals and use of standard amenities. However, we were left feeling disappointed and, on occasions, uncomfortable by the cold and impersonal front of house team, to the surly waiting staff at Mojjo Rooftop Lounge. The lounge is frequented by outside guests, as well as those staying in the hotel. From the service that we received, it actually appeared as though we were inferior customers at dinner because we were staying in the hotel.We were recommended this establishment by a member of our expat community, but we cannot do the same, based on this experience. Given the high competition in the area and the prestigious standings that this hotel holds, we were very disappointed with the level of service that we were accorded.",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

Loads of people raved about the breakfast, but I am not sure why. Hash browns were like tater tots that had been defrosted. Lunch time I tired a pizza that was served with a side of ketchup. I think after so many tries I just gave up on the food. If you stay here I recommend not eating here. Pool and gym were nice. A couple of the machines were out of order in the gym. They have a huge selection of cardio machines and free weights. My first day staying there I was gone almost the entire day and left the service light on in my room. Was surprised to return to my room after 8pm and find that housekeeping had done nothing. Customer service was nothing memorable. ",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

Upon arrival Sunday evening from the Airport we were greeted by a Lady on the front  reception that did'nt sound in great health continually coughing , which any other time was probably ok ? But in the current enviroment , I thought that it wasnt a great welcoming to the Hotel , that said Im sure the hotel checked her health and she was perfectly ok? After the first night my Wife reported to staff of unusual noises coming from the Aircon that were a bit noisy , they replied they will send someone to look at it , while we were out . On return we recieved a letter saying , Aircon maintanance will take place the following day 12-2pm !!! Conviently after we already checked out , so good luck to the next customer ? I thought a room change could have been offered , considering Occupancy of the hotel was very low , noting the amount of ppl at Breakfast etc .

Loved having cocktails at the rooftop bars (vanilla sky & Mojo), & loved the pool - I know some viewers have said its small, but we thought it was appropriate & sophisticated (very adult pool). We were offered an upgrade to a suite from a grand executive room, but preferred the grand executive room with the bath tub, which had great city views. Clean, comfortable rooms with amazing feeling sheets on the bed (best we’ve slept in). We’d stay here again.

Specifically, it is conviently located at the Phrom Phong station of the BTS SkyTrain, just on the other side of the fashionable Emporium mall.

There is a large upscale grocery on the 5th floor of the Emporium plus a 7-11 across the street from the hotel.The hotel is very modern and is kept in very super condition.

The living area, in addition to the tables, sofa and other furniture, has a clothes washer and dryer and a full sized refrigerator.Everyone in the hotel is super although I would like to call out Khun Aim, Khun Tik, Khun Mook, Khun Sherry, and Khun Sun for their friendly, helpful and professional services!I strongly recommend getting a room with club lounge access.

27,1.0,"First let me say I’m a frequent visitor to the sky bar but it’s the first time I have stayed in this hotel.Checked in to the room and it was extremely hot.  Turned the aircon on and it wasn’t cooling the room off.  After about an hour of the aircon on full blast it was still sweltering hot and I was sweating like crazy.  I called the front desk and maintenance came up and worked on the aircon for about 30 minutes.  He determined he couldn’t fix it.  I spoke with the manager asking for nothing more than another room with working aircon, simple right.  This guy was unbelievable, he told me I could stay in the room for another 3 hours or leave and they will try and fix the aircon.  If that didn’t work they would look into another room.  Long story short, I got a refund and left the hotel.  This manager was so horrible and rude like I can’t even understand.  He should be ashamed of how he treats guests, and I told him so.  As an example of what great customer service is.  Upon leaving I booked the Landmark and while checking in I shared my story with their manager.  She could not believe my story.  Because of my experience she upgraded me to a way nicer room at no charge.  What a difference a hotel makes.  I will never go to the sky bar or stay in this hotel ever again.

29,4.0,"We booked the hotel much earlier and so the price was reasonable. The location was a plus point because it is just besides Emporium Shopping Mall and walking distance to EmQuartier and BTS. Therefore location is excellent.We stayed in Premier Room. Nice and spacious room. It was clean, thanks to iB(HK) who cleaned our room throughout the stay. However, a few points I wish to highlight to the hotel so that they can improve better. The aircon was a bit noisy and was louder when at night where surroundings is quiet. Toilet drainage seems to have problem. The glass panel at bathtub looks like a high risk possible accident. The side of glass is fixed to the wall, but the bottom of the glass panel is not. Hence, if someone accidentally hold the glass panel as support, it could break the glass panel and create danger. In additional, due to the gap, water can flow out to the toilet floor causing floor of the toilet very wet. This part, maybe you can take a look of how to improve it. Glue the bottom of the glass panel with silicon or something. I think there is a housekeeping room in our level and we could hear her talking or shouting loudly sometimes when we are sleeping inside the room. It is fine but if you are a light sleeper, this could be a noise to you and affect your sleep. Maybe the management can remind the staff to talk softly. The breakfast spread has western, chinese food, fruits etc. However, it did not change much during our stay. Hence, this is quite bored to us though. Haha. Other than that, all are fine. I think I will come back again to stay next time.",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

38,3.0,"We booked a club grand premier room in this hotel on the 28th floor. Checkin was fast and friendly, room equipped according our expectations, however, a little small considering it should be a „Grand“ room. After checkin we enjoyed the nice pool, then decided to go up to the Mojjo and Vanilla sky bar (separate review). When trying to go up we faced long waiting times with the escalator for the first time. This continued during our stay especially when there were private events on the upper floors.Several times we faced the situation that elevators were blocked by the staff bringing stuff from lower floors to upper floors and vice versa. Again not only long waiting times, but if elevator finally arrived it was simply not possible to go in. Also there is only one elevator for both, the parking lots which are on the lowest floors, and the bars on the highest floors. Consequently in the evening bar and parking guests are blocking each other.Our first breakfast we had in the Silver Lining executive lounge. Not only the choice was somehow very limited, but having only 1 other guest beside us the service did not clean our table nor could we order a second cup of coffee for more than 10 minutes: no staff available at all. So changed to normal breakfast room next day where choice and service was much better, however, asking ourselves why we booked premier room.Summary: average hotel, definitely not 5*.

We had the family connecting suit and its superb. 92 sqm with to bedrooms and bathrooms, open kitchen with a lounge. It got three TVs and three individual ACs. But the best was the clublevel access. What a bargain it was, when we discovered what was included. Amazing breakfast, all day softdrinks, end it said canapees and drinks 6-8pm. It was not canapees but an buffet and ala carte from the same kitchen as the Mojjo Restaurant. And free flow of longdrinks, wine, beer etc. We ate and drank for at leat 3000thb evey day and we also got an very good rate for the suite. The service etc was excellent, and the location is just superb. The best shoppingmalls and skytrain right outside. There is only one negativ thing and that was when we had new years dinner at the Mojjo in 32.floor and discovered that they charge 370thb for a bottle of water! I dont care if its imported from the northpole, its water...anyway, the room are restocked with plenty of local water every day for free so its not a disaster to pay 370thb as we did, but a little uneccesary I think.But altogheter this must be the best 5-star hotel we ever stayd in when comparing quality/price, and probably among top 5 hotels regardless of price.

There are two ways to Hotel : (a) there is a footbridge on the left hand side to Emporium (M/F), go to G/F, where there is an exit next to Starbucks (taxi station in front of Starbucks), the hotel is exactly next to this exit. (2) take the stairs (left hand side) down to the main road, turn into the inner street next to NaRaYa Bag store, it takes about 5 minutes to the hotel. However, the pavement is narrow, it might be inconvenient if carry big luggage.* There is a big 7-11 convenience store opposite to the hotel.* From BTS-Phrom Phong Exit 2, you could go directly to Emporium and EmQuartier (they are facing each other); both have food court and Gourmet Market. * Many local food stalls around the hotel.* Only one stop from BTS Asok, where the MRT Sukhumvit MRT is.   Hotel Service* My husband had contacted the hotel in advance, advised them that this is our wedding anniversary holiday.  Thank you for their warm hospitality, they have arranged a cake and sweet decoration in the room for us.* The swimming pool is not big and there are only about ten sundeck chairs, but the swimming pool is clean and the lady in charge is very nice. We really enjoy the swimming and the sunshine.* We just have tried the breakfast during our stay.  We are satisfied with the variety and taste of food, the most impressive point is they offer hot milk and great coffee (also offer coffee in the lobby during day time).* If I need to mention one shortcoming, the only thing that I hope the hotel could improve is ...... the toilet is spacious, but there is nowhere to hang the wet swimming suit (there is only a small hook outside the shower booth), which bothered us.

The hotel is modern with good apartment like facilities and located very conveniently. It is a 2 minute walk from Emporium Mall, and a 5 min walk to Phrom Phong BTS station (door to door). Upon check in, we realized the photos shown on hotels.com were inconsistent with the reality of a 2 bedroom-connecting unit. The staff were very efficient and took quick measures to fix this issue with a free upgrade to a unit with the correct facilities. This was impressive to say the least, and i would like to give special thanks to the female employee who took the initiative to get this done.

I booked 2 rooms on the executive floor hoping to simply unwind and enjoy but alas, with only 2 different ""snacks"" to choose from (both of which were very cold!) and a limited stock of drinks and an uninviting area (very small & cramped I might add) it was such a disappointment we never went back to the lounge.The real plus, though, on the executive floor were our rooms (both corner rooms)! They were spacious and the bathroom had a his & hers basin, a bathtub, a seperate shower room and a separate toilet.If you're simply wanting to enjoy the executive wing and don't care about the executive lounge then go ahead and book it.

69,5.0,"While I was in here during the COVID-19 Pandemic, I enjoyed the music here. They play house music, so if you are into that it’s great. The food is nice and the cocktails are great. It’s also very easy to get to, as it is accessible to all the 3 train routes. You can even get here by the Airport Rail Link. Not to mention it is also right next to Central World, a major destination. It’s also directly connected to the Novotel Hotel, so if you are staying there, it is as easy as turning left at the reception.The cocktails are reasonably priced. They are priced a bit higher than other places but since you are situated right in the heart of Bangkok (literally next to Central World and to some extent Siam Discovery / Siam Center) it’s reasonable to be charged some extra to get that vibe.I would return again because it’s easily accessible and the atmosphere is great. I haven’t been able to use the pool, unfortunately but I if you are already staying at the hotel you should be able to.Highly recommended.

The toilet is nicely fitted out with a rain shower and lashings of hot water, but, how long would it take to scrub the mould from the tiles? Would it be so hard to adjust the feet on the fridge?

15,5.0,"This hotel is conveniently located about 10 minutes walk from the Sala Daeng BTS and Silom Road, or the hotel provides a shuttle service during the day. The reception staff were efficient and friendly. We booked a Premier One Bedroom which was extremely good value. The room has a kitchen with fridge, stove, micro wave, with plates abd utensils. If you need anything else for the kitchen just call Housekeeping. There was a sofa and coffee table and a good sized flat screen TV, as well as a desk and lamp.The bedroom has a comfortable bed, safe, and wardrobes. The bathroom is a good size with toiletries provided. Basically it is a serviced apartment. We didnt have a view, just the building nextdoor, but higher up you would, or at the front or rear of the building (we were on the side). We didn't have breakfast, but there was a promotion going which made it more than reasonable. There is a very good gym, and an ""L shaped"" pool that wraps around the rear of the building. The pool is deep compared to many Thai pools, and refreshingly cool. We had an issue getting the channels on the bedroom TV. We rang reception and someone came up and fixed it in 5 minutes. All requests to reception were handled promptly. Parking is available. Like a lot of Thai carparks the headroom appears low, however we have a huge 4wd car and managed to park without any problems. The rooms are spotlessly clean. If I were looking for something to criticise I would say that some of the furnishing is getting a bit worn, but not to the extent that it looked bad or I wouldn't want to stay there. I would say given the very reasonable price for the room (and there were several room types cheaper or dearer for that matter), the size of the room, 2 TV's, cleanliness, the kitchen, pool, and parking--that Siri Sathorn is a hotel I would happily stay in again.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

27,3.0,"I booked this hotel because I have been here twice to visit my friends who stayed here ; the room is very good although the air-conditional is loud.  However,  my personal experience with the staff has been more than dissatisfaction.  When I first requested two additional bottles of drinking water, I was told the usual practice is two bottles only.  I seriously cannot understand the big deal of giving two more bottles.  Would that cost the hotel a bomb?  Or is the hotel worried that every guest would demand for two additional bottles?  If there is a convenient shop nearby I would not have bothered to ask for additional drinking water, but there is no 7/11 or whatsoever nearby.  Later when I requested for late check out at 14:00pm on 25th October (tomorrow), I was told that the hotel is full on 25th October hence it is impossible to let me check out at 14;00, and I have to be out at 13:00.  I came back to the room and purposely check Agoda only to find out that roomS (not two or three, but at least five, unless Agodo is lying too) are still available tomorrow.  Lying would not get you anyway, and I believe your hotel needs to retrain your reception staff.  Especially when they see guest standing at the counter, while another colleague was attending to another guest over the phone, your staff ignored the one at the counter and continued to look for things in the steel cabinet.  Probably because I am an Asian, not a farang, hence I have been given such treatment.  A disappointment indeed.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

30,4.0,"I booked a very particular type of room (1 BR designer suite as i used to stay there before) which upon arrival, it was not the same as picture i saw (nor pictures i took on my last trip) on booking website. so i asked to change the room but they said room is being cleaned, at 2 pm, i asked to see the room first to make sure it is the same room i booked, surprisingly, it was not and room was a complete mess. Manager was called, and she was very nice and all, she quickly solved the problem and we finally got to the room we booked originally at around  3 pm. But at the point, i was so hungry i almost faint, luckily, the manager called up to check if the room was ok and offer us free meal from kitchen, save me from hunger. Food was ok, nothing great, but suffice our hunger (as well as anger). Room was great, spacious, clean, hot water is hot, AC is cool, everything function properly. Bed was soft (my friend said too soft but i was so tired, i didn't care), pillows were nice. TV was working well. Safa smell a bit but acceptable. Internet is great. View is a lot better than room on opposite side of corridor. There was construction going on but not so loud, so we were fine. Our night went smoothly. BF was good, but slow on refill. They have small oven so i can reheat croissant, love that! Swimming pool and gym are great. Love the morning swim (only me in the pool) but the construction of building next door is a bit worrying. at one point, crane was lowing big piece of something and i was thinking, please don't drop it over my head. Parking was a bit of a hazard, or maybe i'm just not a good driver. Location is great with everything on walking distance (know this from map, i didn't have strength to explore on arrival). The price that they offered during my stay was also good value. Thank you all the staffs for being patient and understanding.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

The staff was very friendly, the food at the restaurant was really good. Unfortunately, the room was DISGUSTING. Every time I entered the room, my allergies flared up and I spent several miserable nights trying to sleep. Additionally, 75% of the horizontal surfaces covered in fabric contained ""stains"" of the biological variety. It made it very difficult to relax in bed, or on the sofas, or window seats. We attempted to contact management about our concerns during our stay, and were never contacted. My husband, my daughter and I could've chosen much better for much less. I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

Our room was enormous and had a kitchenette although we didn't really use it a lot as there are loads of nearby eating options - though the fridge was certainly very useful. The ensuite shower/bathroom was nicely appointed and always plenty of hot water. Only had breakfast on our first morning - it was very good with a huge choice, just didn't feel we needed a big breakfast with all the food options Bangkok has on offer. The staff are all lovely and the doorman in his traditional costume was unfailingly jolly, and the room was kept very clean with fresh towels every day. Good aircon (essential), not too noisy  though not as quiet as the very most modern.

I was happily  surprised to discover that my room (a junior suite) was available and ready. I paid and ... things changed immediatly. The lady at the counter, without mentioning that before, told me that I cannot get the room until 12pm unless I pay an additional amount ! What kind of policy is it if not racket ? I can easily understand to wait until 12pm or even 2pm when rooms are not available but it wasn't the case. Forgot to mention that I, and my wife too, used to stay for long periods at Siri Sathorn. No need to say that it is the last time.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5
46,4.0,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our Thailand trip. The location suited us as a family with two kids - it's reasonably quiet as it seems to be surrounded by other hotels, serviced apartments and office blocks with the bonus of being able to walk to both the BTS (Sala Daeng) and MRT (Silom), which meant we didn't need taxis to get to where we want.  The hotel provides a free shuttle every 30 mins (do check when they begin and end though) to either of these places if you don't feel like the 10 minute walk. On the walk to the BTS station there is an outdoor food centre which has all sorts of interesting stalls, try get here before or after the lunchtime rush where lots of office workers come and eat.  Next to the BTS station is Silom Centre which has a TOPS supermarket under ground level if you want to stock up on breakfast supplies etc.  We booked the 2 bedroom deluxe suite, which was very spacious and clean. The complimentary fruit platter at arrival was much appreciated. It is a bit dated but we didn't mind. The most important thing was that it was quiet and the blinds did actually block out the light so we all slept well. Showers are a bit ""temperamental"". You can't adjust them after the water has started running or else it runs very hot, or very cold.  We found that it was best if you turn the tap on in the middle, let it run for a few minutes, and if you need to adjust, do that, and leave it on for a few more minutes so it has ""time "" to adjust? Some staff are fantastic (special mention to Kart who was always very cheery and another gentleman who opened doors for us but sadly I forgot to note his name), some aren't great (one lady hung up on me when i called).The pool was very nice as was the gym.

I Adjusted abit to the hot side and I becomes way too hot, adjust a bit to the cold side and it becomes way too cold and when it's perfect, even when you don't touch it, it turns it's temperature to be too hot.

71,3.0,"This is my third stay here which might suggest I have no complaints. Certainly, the location is great (I usually stay in Sathorn/Silom); rooms are spacious if dated; there’s an ok outdoor pool and a very decent gym/fitness centre. But even though it is good value, there’s something missing, at least compared to other hotels with a similar price point and location (Eg: Bandarra Suites, literally across the road).So what’s lacking? First, I’m ok with rooms that are a bit dated (I loved the Dusit Thani, sadly now in the process of being demolished). But SS seems to have a bit of a mould problem; in some rooms there’s no  power point anywhere near the bed to plug in your phone charger etc; and the toilet paper consists of annoying single squares -surely we’re adult enough to have a proper roll of toilet paper. I also don’t get that when you book a room through an aggregator such as Agoda, and specify ‘non smoking’ you get an email from the hotel saying they can’t guarantee a non smoking room. When you press them in reply they confirm a non smoking room, but why have to go through all this to get there? Staff are generally friendly, some are terrific ( doormen, porters restaurant staff, maids ) but others seem a bit jaded indifferent, just going through the motions. But what has irked me most after three stays, and will mean I will think twice about staying again, is a rigidity or policies and rules that don’t make much sense. Ok, I wasn’t allowed to keep in my room the corkscrew I’d asked for; ok I wasn’t allowed to take my included breakfast coffee up to my room but was told if I did that I’d have to pay for it -as if it was room service even though I wasn’t asking anyone to bring it to my room. But the final straw was when I did order a glass of red wine to my room, and realised it was ‘corked’ and undrinkable. I asked for a replacement from a fresh bottle but was told that wasn’t possible. Instead, the room service guy came back to collect the glass of wine and show me a piece of paper that confirmed my order had been canceled. Surely it would have been easier to just ‘accept the customer was right’ and send up a fresh glass?The overriding attitude seems to be ‘can not’ rather than ‘can’. So, now I’m across the road at Bandarra Suites and, two nights in, no complaints. I have a business suite which is ridiculously spacious and has sweeping views over Lumphini Park. There are two pools, friendly staff, a good gym, a coin op laundry. My room rate doesn’t include breakfast but I can get it day by day for a very reasonable  299 baht (about A$14).So, next time I’m in town and looking for great value for money accommodation, I think I’ll be pulling out my iPhone and say ‘Siri, take me to Bandarra Suites’.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

I will mention this we stayed on 6th fl. Always a musty smell getting off elevator, the master RR toilet seat broken so that every time you sat on it it felt tilted.

52,5.0,"we stayed at evergreen our first night in Bangkok. This is not the fanciest place but it had what we needed for our family. we had a 2 bedroom suite with a kitchenette and livingroom. it was quiet enough for us to get over our jet lag. The receptionist were super friendly and helpful. if you have the option to have breakfast included....DO IT! The food is so delicious and something for everyone. You can walk right out front and get a foot massage or hit up the seven eleven for snack or check out the food vendors out front. my impression  was New York city on steriods...it was great! if you need a taxi, the concierge will get you one. need to book a tour? there's someone for that too. we booked a tour and had the best day and saw the grand palace, river tour and so much more. Great stay!","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

A lot of waiting.- Our room was very nice, however too little space for baggage etc, and there was no desk.- The breakfast was good, but a bit boring for this hotel - expected a bit better. :/Would recommend for the room, pool and for sure the LOCATION!","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

The hotel is luxurious, the breakfast buffet is just like a dream for a foodie – so many things to try, plenty of fresh exotic fruits, delicious local dishes and the good old European options... The pool is a bit cold, but the gym is v very nice! The staff is polite and extremely helpful. The transfer to the airport is a bit pricy, but that’s not exactly related to the hotel. Our wonderful apartment consisted of two rooms, and it was so comfortable, at first we didn’t want to go out at all)) Though we did in the end, because the hotel has a perfect location for exploring Bangkok - walkable distance to all the best malls like The Platinum Fashion Mall. The tube station is also just two steps from the hotel. And the street it is located on has plenty of cosy little local places to eat, as well as a Seven Eleven.

62,5.0,"Hey Evergreen staff Just want to say thank you for a very nice stay. I have never gotten so good service before. Your crew is professional but are still able to laugh with the customers. Last night I went down to order a taxi to driver me to the DMK airport for today. I was standing there for maybe 1 hour or so just talking to Sein and Next. We laughed and laughed and had a very great time. I think this is the best you can give a customer. Next has only been working for you for 2 or 3 months but she is really competent and has a unique way to make a guest feel welcome. You should cherish her because she will grow and only become better. She's one of a kind. Sein help me to check in when I came 5am in the morning. He had a big smile and is very friendly and he really tried of I could check in so I didn't had to wait until 2pm. He did everything he could, and kept saying sorry even though is was not his fault but mine that I came so early. He is a very humble guy who is a manager and has only been with you since August 2019. He is a keeper! Thank you so much!

64,4.0,"Chose this hotel as it’s a 5 min walk from our son’s condo and as we were staying 14 nights it proved to be easy walking distance from BTS, Siam and Platinum district (from where we usually stay).  However, we booked a superior room which was adequate for a few nights but no where to store clothes ie no wardrobe space if you are staying longer.  Bathroom was a good size but towels were well worn and although clean need replacing soon room had a nice large bed and excellent bed linen and very comfortable with efficient a/c. Lacking a well placed sockets in fact the only one we could use was under to shelf so had to take the kettle into the bathroom (only twice did housekeeping replenish 2 tea bags).Room was clean but in sadly need of refurbishment and balcony needs a deep clean, pool area proved to be quiet during our visit but probably a few more sun beds would be useful at busy times the pool and gym staff were friendly and welcoming.With the exception of the two porters and the duty manager the female staff need coaching in customer service, they were rude and extremely unhelpful particularly when we checked out.  Where is the famous Thai smile it certainly wasn’t at the Evergreen last 2 weeks.Although we had a couple of issues we would return as its such a convenient  location but but upgrade to a deluxe room or above in future.  We didn’t eat in the hotel as it just didn’t appeal and considering we stayed for 14 nights the staff with the couple of exceptions already mentioned were quite off hand.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

Moreover, we did not see any of the long-serving staff anymore.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

We returned after 2 hours and found a clean and comfortable room, dated and chipped but with a bathtub and an opening window.

68,2.0,"We booked for the family room with a balcony.  The room was pretty big and had two bathrooms and a kitchen which was nice. The balcony, which was our main reason for booking, was impossible to sit in. They put no less then 5 condensers in it, so it’s hot chocking air on you face and always very noisy. The staff response for that was that “It’s a common thing in every hotel”. WTF? No costumer service awareness.Breakfast is somewhat between average to poor, pool is poor, looks much better in photos. Gym’s lousy. Will not recommend. ","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

Also walking distance from the Siam boat station. Located close to lot of eateries. Has a massage place, 7/11 store and lot of street food being sold right outside. Rooms are tiny but pretty well equipped.Staff is friendly, although there is some language difficulty.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
73,4.0,"The Evergreen Place Siam in Bangkok was a neat and tidy hotel with friendly staff. The room was quite big and had a small fridge, microwave, kettle, and cook top, the decor was a little dated but it was fine. Location: The MBK Centre was a 10 min walk away, and the hotel is very close to the Ratchathewi Station, about 1 min walk. There is an awesome dining precinct right across the road called Coco Walk with several great, affordable Thai restaurants and bars. I recommend one in there called Thai Town, the food was excellent and drinks were strong. As it's a big main road, it's best to go to the Ratchathewi station, go up the big stairs, across, and down the stairs on the other side, in order to cross the road. There is a Massage place next to the hotel driveway which does Thai massages but we didn't think they were very good, our backs actually felt more sore afterwards, I wouldn't recommend that one.Facilities: The hotel has an outdoor pool on the 8th floor with sun lounges, its not a big pool but it's fine. The gym was good, it looks small but it actually has a lower level and rooms behind it with a boxing studio, and toilets with lockers and showers. The gym has free weights, lots of machines with cable weights, treadmills and fit-balls, and provides towels and water.Breakfast: The breakfast buffet was good, it had a mix of western and asian foods and lots of healthy options as well, and an omelette station. Shopping: Definitely check out the MBK Centre which has a bit of everything and has lots of food places to eat at, and good public toilets. There's alot of bargains, some will do bartering, souvenirs, and fashion for men, women, and kids as well. Another good Mall for fashion is Platinum Fashion Mall, it has a huge amount of awesome unique designs for women, kids and men, but mostly women are the main ones here, less bartering and more fixed prices, higher prices but better quality. Transport: A taxi to the airport is around 250-300 baht, and a Tuktuk to Platinum Fashion Mall is around 100 baht. Enjoy!! ","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

8,3.0,"I stayed 2 times in the executive room at the same time. The first time was the 27th floor and the second was the 26th floor. The room: Chao Phraya River view is very beautiful. Sunset photography in the evening is spectacular. The room is beautifully decorated. Full amenities such as a sofa to sit and watch the river view, a luxurious Jacuzzi to soak in. In addition, the bathroom is separated between the shower zone and the toilet zone. The minibar is very affordable if compared to other hotels.Food: The foods we ordered for In-room dining were delicious Tom Yum Goong and steamed salmon with curry paste. I can sit and eat in my room and enjoy the view of the river. Breakfast was ok but not excellent. The cakes and coffee at the Coffee shop on the 1st floor are averages. Service: Before I check-in, I had been prepared about the service here from previous reviews. So, I didn't expect much. Front staff provided standard service and there was a defect in the number of days. But they fixed it as well. Club Lounge staff offered good service, greeted and said goodbye to all guests as well as delicious snacks and drinks with a stunning river view.My 2nd stay: Before I was preparing to check out, the hotel staff called from the front office to ask me that ""when would you like to check out? because our checkout time is 12.00 p.m."" I replied, ""I told the staff at check-in that I would like to check out at 2 pm"" (when check-in, the staff asked me that would you like to check out at 4 p.m. because you have been granted a Diamond Hilton honor member) That front office staff shouldn't call me like this because it looks so rude. You should make sure that I have already informed the check-out time. I felt so bad about what happened. At first, I rated 4/5 but when encountered that incident, I rated 3/5.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
9,1.0,"Poor front service.I booked the hotel with 2500THB hotel credit. There's no information provided at all upon checking, so I thought it will be used while we check out. On the check out date the front gave us the coupon that expired on the check out date and charges room service normally. so we have to spend the coupon on the bakery shoo which is the only shop available in the hotel.It is normal to make mistake but the front office does not show any responsibility for their mistake for not giving us the coupon upon checking in, that's the reason that we'll never be back there again. The service quite poor compare to the hotel in the same area, no greetings, no assisting, even the luggage was drop at the door, no turn down. There's 60 THB charges for an ice bucket or any tray requests (spoon, fork, plate), no bottle opener, provide 1 toothbrush for 2 person. The window super dirty (see photo).",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
10,4.0,"I'm not sure why I'm writing this review as the management don't respond and I'll be repeating problems that many other guests have mentioned before, but here goes.The positives first.I took a staycation in a panoramic suite that had been recently renovated and was absolutely stunning; much more glamourous and interesting than it looks in the photos.The lounge was open and we enjoyed sandwiches and cakes for afternoon tea, and cheese, fried rice, (awful) tempura vegetables, and quite a lot of booze during the evening.It was my partner's birthday so the hotel gave us a cake and the lounge staff organised a 3pm check out, both of which were amazing- thank you!Why only 4.2 stars?The hotel charges a ""tray charge"" of THB60 to bring ice to your room. This is so nasty and is a money-making technique akin to a boarding-house, not a 5-star hotel. What's more, I had already paid a 10%  service charge so why they think it's okay to charge guests again is a mystery.  The other thing that brings this hotel down is how the staff close things earlier than the advertised time. The evening drinks are supposed to be until 19:00 but at 18:30 a kitchen porter was there ready to take the food away and by 18:50 everything was packed away-  ""finished"" the lounge attended gleefully announced when asked where the food had gone.   The same was with the breakfast which is supposed to close at 11 am but come 10:30 am, food is being packed away and the coffee machines are being switched off. I understand that staff want to go home as soon as they can, but for the same reason a guest would be denied service if they arrived late, the staff should not clear away so early. Also, pretending the food had ""finished"" when it hadn't (they'd just packed it away early) is not very good service at all.Additionally, the reception ladies need a few days of customer service training. They are a hard-faced crew who would be more suited to work at immigration  than a hotel- a ""hello and ""how are you"" would be better greetings than ""passports!"" and ""credit card you book with!""Again, this has been mentioned in quite a few other reviews but as nothing has changed, it must just be the culture of the hotel.Sadly, the pool area is an utter mess. I understand they are renovating but that does not excuse empty glasses and bottles discarded on the (ripped and stained) sun loungers.Finally, the boat service is still not in use ""due to covid"" which is a little silly as all the other hotels and the local authority have their boats whizzing around and I can assure you, the hotel is busy enough to warrant the service. The steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi are also either out of service ""due to covid"" or because of renovations- the staff I asked couldn't remember which excuse to give me so gave me both! I suspect that both the boat service and the sauna etc. are actually closed to save money.However, despite some of the strange rules and lacklustre service, I will return to this hotel.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

18,4.0,"We spend a two-nights staycation over a weekend.Check-in was super busy on Saturday but I still got a very friendly service and recognition of my Diamond status.We were upgraded to a beautiful Panoramic Executive Suite (#2802). The suites are showing their age although this room clearly was upgraded since our last stay about 3 1/2 years ago. We love the view from the room, partly over the beautiful Chao Praya River and the surrounding area.The Executive Lounge was unfortunately closed due to renovation works so the experience was shifted to a cafe next to the reception area. A bit busy for my taste but the spread was acceptable given the current situation. Breakfast was good although the line on Sunday morning looked like a bad day at immigration.What we did not appreciate was that dinner service consists of a buffet at the Flow and if you do not like that, the only option we had (on Saturday night) was to go for a dark snack on the rooftop. On days where that outlet is closed (which is pretty much the whole week), you may have to go for some food outside the hotel.Sadly, the river boats are also not operating at this time. What a shame. Many other riverside properties have this service now so not sure why our Hilton cannot.All in all, we still very much enjoyed our stay.

However, it seemed to be wrong. I was actually ok then. What I was a bit dissatisfied was some of the guests didn’t wear the plastic disposable gloves when they picked up some food at the executive lounge.

24,2.0,"For sure this hotel need a lot of improvements. Although the lobby looks good but there are many details that i think should be improved from the hotel1. The shuttle boat not on serviced, as a five star hotel located by the River i believe its essential to keep this service to attract more people and compete with other hotels2. The pool is lack of maintenance, many dirty mark and also u can find some dry bird dirt on the mattress 3. It is the smallest 5 star room i ever had. Its like holiday inn level (you can even see the fridge facing you everytime wake up in the morning)4. The cleaning service is not the best for 5 star hotel. I found 2 pcs of hair on my sink and shower when i just came5. The bathtub is stucked cannot drain the water after taking bath6. I was surprised when i was asking for a mask, they sell it for 10 baht/pc. Which is quite shame while other hotels is trying to implement high standard of safety by just give away for a mask. (Their neighbor hotel beside icon siam even send me mask 4pcs on daily basis to make sure everyone stay save during pandemic)Hope there would be a good improvement further for a big chain hotel like this otherwise people will just move to other hotel with better services",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

We had a panoramic view from the room and it was amazing, with a beautiful scene of the skyline and the river. The lounge was exceptional with tasty treats and drinks.

Gib), not remorse understanding of service and a customer calling several times, waiting minutes, with no answer/no reply.It’s sad where the industry has come and situations badly handled.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
28,5.0,"I stayed five nights at the Millenium Hilton in Bangkok because I found a very advantageous offer that allowed me to benefit from the executive suite at almost the price of the standard room.The room was very nice and neat, with two marble bathrooms and a spectacular view of the river.Both from the bedroom and from the living room. The breakfast buffet was delicious. Highly recommended",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
29,1.0,"This is a third time to stay here and it's my mistake. I booked three booking at the same time and I don't know what I will see.1. I booked the room with campaign that can early check-in and late check-out. Firstly, I call to book directly to the hotel. No one tell me that it's not guarantee and I understand that It guarantee because It list on benefit of the campaign. 1 week before check-in, I call to front to remark them about early check-in, so they cannot do anything and ask me back to call them one day before check-in. OK, 1 day before check-in, I call to front again and they said that they cannot guarantee, please call them back on check-in day. On check-in day, around 10.00am, I call to front again and they say first come, first serve. This is so terrible for me and get me annoying.2. About hotel credit voucher 1000 THB, to use in the hotel. I want to make plan to use it as alcohol drinking. I call to Hotel and ask them Which restaurant can I use and Can I use with alcoholic drinking? they say that I can use only 2 restaurants in the hotel. After that, I check again with FB Messenger and they tell me that I can use 3 restaurants that I ask them back to ensure that why staff say difference but Staff on FB guarantee that I can use in 3 restaurants. At the check-in time, staff tell me that I can use only 2 restaurants and I ask them back that Can I use to drink alcoholic drinking? they say I can use it with amount of the voucher. After I've a dinner at ICONSIAM. I go to Maya restaurant in the hotel and ask them to use. They say I cannot use this voucher for any kind of drinking that declare in the voucher. Why? My plan is failed again and again. I make a decision to buy some beers at 7-11 and when I arrive to the hotel, I go to front and complain them about mislead information. They ask me to show message on my FB messenger that my phone is in the room. In my mind, What is wrong with you staff, Did you think I'm lie?. OK, I go back to the room and take my phone to them and they try to excuse with offer me to use the voucher as I wish.3. 3 times to stay here, I and my girlfriend see dust in the air at the room that I don't know why4. There's some maintenance on 5 December 2020 that is the Father day in Thailand. What the hotel thinking about maintenance in the peak period that Thai people need to stay with their family with a good mood. Smell is so bad in the lobby and they move front check-in to SPA. RidiculousSo, I think the staffs at Hilton Bangkok are not well trained and They shouldn't serve 5-star hotel.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Great communication with the hotel manager so got an upgrade to a suite, which probably made a good first impression. The check-in process at the Exec lounge was awesome. Again, applause to the staff! They were well-trained and very very nice. I definitely feel that Diamond member has some value at this property. Stayed here for a whole week and it was great every day. They had a really huge breakfast selections. All type of Thai, Chinese, Indian, western food that I don't think I ate all of them in one week stay. There is a free transit boat to the sky train. The pool was really cool.  It is right next to the newest mall in town, Icon Siam, which is a plus. If I go back to Bangkok, I'll definitely stay here again.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
37,1.0,"I just checked in and there has an event when I checked in.I saw the room type and floor where can I got provided at hilton app in advance. However, I proceed check in at the reception. When I checking in, I ask the high floor and she said okay. I expect the 20 floor cause I can see the floor is available at the app. However she gave me 15th floor and I ask to higher room. She said all the guest should be stayed at 15th floor due to effect of covid19. I really don’t understand cause I already confirm the floor before the visit. I said the app showing that I can check in higher room but she still insist I should stay at 15th floor and it is the highest room where she can provide. Actually this is not my first stay and I visited this hotel 3 times even this year and this is the terrible experience ever. Finally I show her the app and ask to her If I check in at app with 20floor then what should you do. Then she change the room for me. Why she did’t gave the room before I show her the proof. I really don’t understand why she lying to me. From this experience, I don’t know well If I will visit here later.어플에서 높은 층 배정 뻔히 확인되는데도 불구하고 코비드때문에 다른 층 안된다고 거짓말한다. 어플에서 봤다고 하니 킹베드는 없고 트윈베드만 있다고 또 거짓말한다. 어플을 실행시켜서 보여주니 그 때서야 높은 층으로 배정해준다. 직원의 서비스에 실망이다",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

39,5.0,"For our first ever trip to Thailand, our family stayed at the Millennium Hilton for 3 nights during the Chinese New Year period. The service was so good that after returning from the Conrad Maldives, we ended up cancelling our one night stay on 31st Jan originally booked at the Sheraton across the river and stayed again this hotel.I'm both Hilton Diamond and Marriott Platinum so the elite benefits were similar, but the service offered at this hotel during our first stay was just beyond expectations, which meant it was a no brainer to stay here again during our final night in thailand.We stayed in the newly renovated Executive Panoramic Suite, facing north during our first stay and facing south on the second stay. The suites were excellent, clean, decent sized, and both directions had superb views of the Chao Phraya River.The location was perfect, right next door to the ICONSIAM with plenty of dining options along the River. You can exit the east side and also take a complimentary Hilton Shuttle Boat to Sathon Pier, which I did during night time, just to breeze through the scenic river and enjoy the night view. Most of the famous attractions in Bangkok were also situated along the River, so it was very convenient to explore from the Hotel.Dining at the Flow for buffet breakfast and drinks at the Executive lounge (with scenic view balcony) was great with a decent variety of choices. It was quite full during our stay but we didn't have any trouble finding a seat quickly.A big thank you to Meen (HHonor Supervisor) and Robert (Operations Director) for making our stay so memorable. We encountered some initial issues during the reservation stage, but this was quickly sorted out with their help. Personal greetings upon arrival made us feel very welcome and all special requests during our stay were accommodated, from a few tasty mangos, to pre-prepared takeaway breakfast early in the morning before our flight to the Maldives. These beyond expectations services are what really differentiates between the 5-star hotels, the things that we will remember, and bring us back to the hotel in the future!Much have changed in the last few months since our stay, but we hope everyone are safe and well at the Hilton. We look forward to coming back to the hotel, hopefully in the near future.SC",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
40,5.0,Great location for stay and pleasaure. The popular IconSiam with fruitful options of restaurants and shops is connected with  steps away. The highfloor views facing river and IconSiam are especially spectacular both in day and night. The Executive lounge on top of the floors are also cozy and worthwhile.,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
41,4.0,We stayed at this place for 7 nights and decided to change it up halfway through by changing rooms to face the other way down the river and it was great!! We did prefer the side facing the shopping mall and MO but both sides are decent. Try to get the highest floor you can and do check out the top restaurant and bar for some amazing sunset views. Unless you can enjoy the executive lounge as they have similar stunning sunset views! Really one of the best value for Money Hilton’s in BKK and the location along the river and next to a shopping mall is perfect if your going to China town or any Michelin star places. Ohh I almost forget the pool has a super view of the river a great place to have a cold one and get away from the hustle and bustle of BKK. ,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
42,5.0,"We went during the Covid-19 Outbreak, but after conditions were lifted for Local shops, and restaurants to reopen.Like most big establishments taking time to remodel or do some much needed construction. They set up a barrier, and did there best to make sure not to inconvenience any guest who decided to stay at the hotel. Which was very nice, and considerate of the management to think of the guest first. This Resort is located in a very awesome location that has a back entrance where you can access the river front, as well a near by local market where you can eat local food as well shop for some medium priced wears. You can also find fairy access to go across the river to visit the local temple as well.Near by is a SkyTrain station soon to be completed as well the road ways.Current check in times location during the mid-day you check in at the 31st floor, in the afternoon will check in at the front desk. Covid Hours: Check in 12PM - Check out 3PM/15:00Normal Hours: 3PM/15:00 Check in, 12PM Check outYou can always ask to get your bags checked in, as well request early check in or late check out.Tea Time: at a price of 15$ per person, you  get a simple plate of assorted snacks as well fruit, which includes your typical choices of verity of tea, coffees, as well sodas of your choice. Served on the 31 floor of the building which words cannot describe the view that you get of the “Chaophraya” river as well Bangkok city line. Out of the snacks we got the green tea cake was the most delicious out of the whole set.... but might have been to sweet for some individuals. But due to my unique sweet tooth I found it rather tasty. In-Room Dining: Yes a price tag, but the food is worth it.Cesar Salad: Idk if it’s made fresh dressing, but for sure taste like it. If it was not then I for sure would like to know the brand. Very good it also came with some sorted bread making it even more worth it.Raadna Talay: Seafood Thai style noodles the flavor was on another level.Restaurants are limited due remodeling or closed because of previous restrictions set up due to the Virus. So I can find it understandable with the situation, they handle it with pre menu set of Bento boxes set up for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner with 3-5 options with Asian or Western choices that you can select from. The Bentos were amazing from ether the Asian or Western Style the cooks here know how to cook any style meal so far from everything that I have tasted.They really do the best at everything they can to accommodate the guest in any way even in selections. Was really impressed by this. The staff from beginning to the end of our stay was 100% fantastic, very professional, as well courteous of what ever was needed. Rooms are typical set to a U.S price 130$+ pending on which style of room option you like to have for your stay this is only due to the Covid. Rooms on a typical average in the 300$ plus. I do suggest the rooms with a standard or Pano view of the River you will never regret the cost due to the awesome view you get to see with your own eyes.Note: If you getting a Taxi ride be carful, from our experience our driver didn’t want to go through the issues of driving directly into the Resort, assuming due to road construction reasons.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

One things that hard to find in big hotels, the staff was so polite and quiet, I would of thought I was staying in a private villa! The executive floor gives you access to the executive lounge which was beautiful as well! I felt the 2 hour window for happy hour got a little crowded and rushed, but it was very good so I can see why! The pool was great, a little cold, and loved the lounge chairs in the water. The breakfast at the hotel was out of this world! So many choices! I could of spend hours there! The staff went above and beyond to take care of me, and I felt very special!

57,4.0,"Returned to this hotel for a short stay, 10 years after my last visit. The newly renovated Executive Suite was indeed comfortable. However, housekeeping had done a poor job, as the carpets had not been vacuum cleaned  from the previous guests (we found lots of potato chips, clusters of hairs, paper- and plastic pieces on the carpets), making us feel the room was not clean. The room was then serviced once again.Also, the room was very hot throughout our stay (despite adjusting the air con to 70 degrees on full speed). Indeed, we found all the public areas in the hotel to be very hot, especially the Executive Lounge. The staff in the Exec. Lounge were professional and friendly, thank you! However, in spite of offering one of the best views of the Bangkok skyline, I found the furniture to be somehow tired and outdated as well as very uncomfortable. Also, I found the food & beverage offerings to be on the very low side compared to other high end hotels I have frequented in Bangkok during my many visits to the city.Breakfast was a huge disappointment. The variety was huge, but the Egg Benedicts that I ordered were the worst I ever had. The buns were hard as bricks and the eggs were overcooked. My wife did not enjoy her picks as well. HHonors recognition was excellent.All in all a nice hotel, but with the large competition in the hotel market in Bangkok, I have to say that in my humble opinion there are better hotel choices in Bangkok these days for the same kind of money.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Part of the lounge area resembles an I paved car park while the bar is nothing more than fridge and trolley.We weren’t allowed to checkin before 3pm so had a lengthy wait - at 3pm they were having IT issues so we had a further wait while we were assigned a room.Overall it’s suggest avoiding - there’s better hotels for the price range.

We stayed in a Family Suite on the 17th floor for the extra space and were not disappointed.This hotel is situated next to a gigantic newly built shopping mall with multiple food options, although I had the hotel’s own prawn Pad Thai by the pool and it was fantastic. Ah, the pool, in an area on the fourth floor known as The Beach. We spent a few hours there and it was a lovely start to our holiday. You wan walk in a few inches of water between the loungers (and there are enough of these with some underneath gazebos and also some big beanbags available. You can look out to the river below and see (and hear) the many boats passing by. It’s good, as you are high enough to have some peace whilst at the same time there is good visual and hearing stimulation, I think that works really well. The air was surprisingly good there too, but the nice cooling breeze probably helped in that respect.We went up to the jazz lounge on the 31st floor on our first evening, where there was an excellent singer and a talented local band who played requests. It is not cheap there, a Singha beer was £7.50 (so about $10), but I guess you pay for the ambience and the view too, which were both great. The next evening I went up to the outside bar at the top and got some great photos of the sunset at the decommissioned helipad (just above the excellent bar). So for two nights it was a great experience all round.We only had breakfast once, but there is plenty of choice and the smiley chef even introduced himself to us and said if we needed anything to let him know.

We stayed here several years ago when the shopping and night life were across the river but now the exciting IconSiam center is right next door with shops, restaurants and a fabulous fountain and light show 3 times per evening.  There is a convenient regular shuttle boat to the BTS station. As Diamond members we were given a renovated room on an executive floor.  The room was quite small but functional and had a great view of the river.  Two negatives about the room:  there was no hot water to the sink no matter how long you let the water run and there was a faint smell of sewer at various times during the day and night.  The executive lounge on the 31st floor had stunning views, and good food and beverage offerings.  Breakfast at Flow was excellent with lots of variety and sitting outdoors one could enjoy breakfast whist watching the boats on the river.  Hotel staff did their best to keep the pigeons away from the dining tables.  The gym had a good variety of equipment though the tv function was not working on any of the treadmills, so some updating required there.  We’d definitely stay at this hotel again as it is so conveniently located.  ",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

69,5.0,"We were on Celebrity Millennium that docked for two days at the LAEMCHABANG port, so we decided to stay overnight at the Millennium Hilton in Bangkok.The hotel is located along the Chao Phraya River.  We were picked up by Hilton’s ferryboat at the SP Taksin Bridge.  The boat ride took about 5 minutes.  We were too early for check-in, so we left our luggage at the hotel and went to the shopping complex next door for lunch.  By the time we came back to the hotel, our room was ready.We were on the 14th floor overlooking the river.  The room itself was small but comfortable.  Breakfast was in a large airy restaurant with a lot of international selections.  To visit any of the attractions along the Chao Phraya River, we had to take the hotel’s ferryboat (runs every 30 minutes) back to the Taksin Bridge and pick up the public boat from there.  It was very convenient and cheap.  We paid 20 Baht ($.65) pp to go to the Grand Palace. Millennium Hilton is a beautiful hotel and every staff member we met was attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, we only stayed here for one night so did not get to enjoy the hotel’s many amenities. We would definitely stay longer next time we are in Bangkok.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
70,2.0,"An old property which has become an attractive location due to its immediate proximity to Icon Siam, the latest and best mall in Bangkok. However, its age shows as public areas look out of date. The pool area is a disappointment as its not at all an area to relax unlike other pool areas of similarly rated hotels in Bangkok. The rooms are small. This must be one of the few 4-5 star hotels in Bangkok with no espresso machine in room. There is also no turn down service. The bathroom amenities are of poor quality. Cleanliness is an issue. A cockroach was found in the bathroom. Check-in and out process is slow and with long lines, the process is even slower and not what is expected of this class of hotel. Staff at check-in and out are robotic and process driven and smiles are plastic. Not a pleasant experience for meI would only recommend this location if one needs to be near Icon. Otherwise there are far better options.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Breakfast at the main restaurant was great in terms of quality, service and setting. Overall, highly recommended!",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
72,5.0,"The location and the views is what gives this property a resort feel. Nestled between Iconsiam and Khlong San Market on the river with easy connection to various city highlights is its strongest point. Everything else is just icing on the cake.Booked 12 nights using a mixture of cash and Hilton points - 10 nights family suite and 2 nights of Panorama suite (booked what I could find) for 2 adults and our 2 children (ages 8 and 11). Got 6 nights of family suite and 6 nights panorama suite due to availability. This make it being upgraded 4 out of the 12 nights or 34% upgrade rate as a Diamond elite member of the Hilton loyalty program - an accomplishment in my opinion considering that is was the busy season and they are fully booked through the holidays. We thank the hotel management for this generous upgrade. Both suite types were lovely offering panoramic riverside views, elegantly appointed, comfortable beds, great water pressure in the shower even though we were on the 26tth floor, ample toiletries/amenities, espresso machine, Singha bottled water, etc. On two separate nights we watched the fireworks above the river, the bridge, and IconSiam.Executive Lounge: Mediocre F&B but again the views are unbeatable. For alcohol beverages during happy hour, they only serve 4 kinds of non-premium liquor plus beer and wine. They run out of food fairly quickly and they don't replenish timely. They even run out of utensils and the staff seem nonchalant about bringing more out.  Teatime is available for early afternoon snacks and beverages. Seating is available indoors or outdoors with expansive views of the river and Bangkok skyline. Silly that they won't allow guests to sit/use in the circular rotunda between 11 am-5 pm using the excuse that they are cleaning the place. The staff are hit or miss with most are miserable and some are hostile. Despite of the heroic efforts by Khun Nuch and Khun Wink to make us welcome, our time at the lounge was not enjoyable and on the final day we avoided the lounge altogether. Attitude shown by staffers is that guests are burdensome, especially the kitchen guy in the white garb! If it's not included in your rate, I don't recommend you pay for the lounge access.Breakfast at Flow: Great riverside location to have breakfast as the variety, ingredients, the preparations, and the service are all top notch. I have watched the staff manage the waves of guests showing up to partake breakfast and they always performed flawlessly. The buffet fare typical of most top notch Bangkok properties with fruits, salads, cereals & breads, cheeses, cured meats, eggs station with accompaniments, sweets & pastries, noodle station, Thai and Asian foods including Miso soup and assortment of Taki, etc. Would like to give special thanks to Khun Aiws (at the sushi/cheese bar) who went above and beyond the call of duty to make our dining experience enjoyable. The boat ride: the hotel offers a comped scheduled shuttle boat to Sathorn Pier where you can take the BTS (Bangkok light rail system) for easy access to Bangkok's areas of interest. On Christmas day we were dropped off at a pier close to Assumption Cathedral to attend the mass. On the way back, we were fortunate that the hotel manager was in attendance and was gracious to summon the boat back to said pier for a return trip to the hotel. Thank you Khun Josef for your hospitality and concern for your guests.Service was disappointing at the lounge but great elsewhere in this hotel especially at Flow during breakfast, and by management staffers who were very accommodating. We thank Khun Rose and Khun PK for attending to our every need. Not only they set up a Christmas tree for us in the room to celebrate the holiday properly, they also sent us a delicious cake and a bag full of baked goods as Christmas gifts. Thank you so much for your generosity and hospitality. All in all, we highly recommend this property for the accommodating management, the location, breakfast by the river, and the views.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

80,5.0,"We loved our newly renovated panoramic suite! The decor was fresh and modern, with enough Thai elements in the decor to give the hotel its unique cultural identity. The light-flow was superb and the bed very comfortable, making it a sanctuary in a big vibrant city! The shuttle boat was punctual, and a comfortable, efficient way to get to Saphan Taksin BTS Station, from which we can easily access the rest of Bangkok. If you love malls, Iconsiam is a mere 5-minute walk away! The staff at Flow did an admirable job seating fussy guests during breakfast; they ensured that tables were cleared and coffee topped up promptly. The young gentleman who was assigned to clean my room on the 23rd floor on the 27 and 28 of January, was hardworking and efficient, and he was always so cheerful and positive! Thank you Khun Sy (I hope I remembered his name correctly; management please assist to identify and commend him for us). The Executive Lounge staff were fantastic! Thank you, Khun Enjoy and Khun Ann, for the warmth and hospitality! We also enjoyed a wonderful evening at Three-sixty rooftop bar! The soft-shell crab salad was excellent! Our compliments to the chef! We felt that overall the Millennium Hilton did very well, especially considering that it was the Chinese New Year season, and occupancy was probably near capacity. However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the breakfast could include an on-demand juice station, and freshly cut mangoes, in line with many other 5-star hotels. Secondly, while the offering during happy hour at the Executive Lounge was alright, it was far from the most impressive we’ve had. And finally, we felt that the food options in Three-sixty was rather limited. In many good hotels, the staff would gladly offer to bring you the menus from other in-house restaurants, should you request for something not listed in the menu. On a final note, we had a memorable stay here, but while staying by the river has many advantages, we also like city-centre hotels that offer direct access to a Skytrain station.

The personnel behind the front desk are extremely professional and have always been incredibly helpful. There is nothing they won't do to try and accommodate your needs when reasonable. The food in any of the restaurants is spectacular to say the least, not cheap but a cut above. The breakfast is probably the best in Bangkok, in my opinion..They have both Western and Asian options, fruits, salads, pastries and more..I have been coming to BKK for over 15 years. The front desk always acknowledges my status as a Diamond Level member, welcomes me honestly and most recently upgraded me to a panoramic suite on the 15thfloor.This hotel is popular among Japanese and European guests alike...Many tours operate with this hotel in mind..The ""Staff"" members and employees, from Front Desk to Housekeeping, Food Service to Valet are a big reason I return a couple times a year.

The connecting Club rooms were awesome, clean and with all the amenities you need but the best part is the view!

98,3.0,"I have stayed here a few times now and the lack of consistency in service is what lets this hotel down.This trip I had a exec room reserved and checked in at the lobby where I was expecting to be taken to the lounge to complete the formalities, however, this didn't happen.No recognition of HH status and I was allocated a room adjoining the lift shaft which was incredibly noisy so requested a room change. My profile on my account clearly states a room away from the elevators is my preferred choice, but seemingly ignored.The room itself was fine, albeit a little on the small side, but the view over the river was very good and the soundproofing seemed to be effective.My previous review of this hotel commented on the poor quality of the food and beverages offered in the executive lounge and sadly nothing has changed since my last visit. The view from the lounge is amazing, but the three days I was here, it was overcrowded and not a very relaxing atmosphere. Service was slow and some of the staff gave the impression they didn't want to be there.Food again was mediocre and the wine offered wasn't the best with the food having to be continuously replenished due to the numbers of guests in the lounge.Despite notices clearly stipulating that kids under a certain age not being allowed into the lounge during the drinks service, this was not enforced by staff and totally ignored by irresponsible parents who think it is OK for their kids to run around the lounge uncontrolled and let them poke around the food with their bare hands, although it has to be said that many adults also seemed incapable of using the serving tongs provided.There is a lot of construction ongoing outside the hotel with the new skytrain link causing a lot of disruption. Getting the taxi here was a nightmare and the traffic is horrendous. To compound the problem, traffic accessing Iconsiam gridlocks the surrounding roads during peak hours.I would avoid the area until the construction is complete and easier access to the hotel via the Skytrain is completed.Clearly the hotel must be maintaining its occupancy levels despite the erratic service levels and perhaps they feel that they are fulfilling guest satisfaction expectations.Unfortunately they didn't with this guest!",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Hotel is brand new, which is amazing in itself, so fresh, no smells in the room, and finally I found a hotel with a good air conditioning system in the room that is not freezing and not loud, it is quiet and does exactly what you want it to do. Nice bathroom too, and everything just works perfectly.The best part of the stay were the staff though, some of the friendliest and most attentive I ever met. Especially the Korean lady at reception, Ester. She remembered my name from day one and even when I came back after a few months with no booking, just a walk in, she remembered my name. Impressive, she should get a raise :)Anyway, everything else was great too, facilities and the pool are fantastic. This is definitely my favorite hotel in Bkk now within it’s price range at least.Oh and the location is the best. Walk to Emporium is 5min",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0
23,4.0,"Pros:- Hotel is very new. So, general conditions in all area are still very good.- Room is good. Bed linen is also very new.- Overall cleanliness is also good.- Staffs are friendly and hospitable.- Rooftop bar is quite nice with good vibes.- Full facilities in room are setup well.- Swimming pool is nice and big.- Breakfast is satisfying.- Lobby area is beautiful decorated.- There are various choices of cake which look so tasty.- Hotel is located in a walkable range to the train stations or department stores.Cons.- Unfortunately, the hotel just opened and encounters pandemic situation. So, some facilities look not fully function.- Except the headboard in guestroom which is beautiful, overall design of room is too simple. (personally)- There is a bad smell from the drain from toilet in many areas of the hotel e.g. in guest room, lobby restroom.- Breakfast choices are limited.- As the bed linen is very new, the blanket is not so soft and fluffy yet. - Even though the room facing BTS Asoke offers a good city view, on the contrary, room on BTS Promphong side doesn't not offer quite beautiful view.- There is a bit confusion to connect from car park to lobby since the sign is not so clear.**Special thanks to K.Phan (Concierge) for his assistance on our several luggages and stuff although we came to check in at very late night.**",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

25,5.0,"Great stay with some teething issues but still a great hotel. These are purely comments which i hope will help as i experienced. Arrival: Arrived in a limousine from The Peninsula and had to wait for over 5 minutes as the car infront was trying to Valet and blocking the entrance but the driver was in a full flow conversation with the bell boy who didnt even acknowledge our car trying to arrive.  Eventually a small wave.  Bell Boys and Management ALWAYS very friendly when entering or leaving the hotel during my stay. Reception great welcome and very friendly. I had two consecutive bookings to make things more complicated. Great explanation of the hotel facilities too. Lovely. Bedroom fabulously looking but there is NO plug socket for a hairdryer near to a mirror. Had to use the socket under the TV but no mirror. Bathroom only have shaver sockets. TV channels are limited but i guess these will improve when the international market returns (comparing to other 5* in Bangkok)Restaurants not fully operational which is perfectly acceptable especially during this time.  Had dinner at Tuxedo where you could enjoy the all day dining restaurant menus too:1. Arrived and sat just behind the pillar and was IGNORED for over 10 minutes. One guy inside the window kitchen wearing black (and just chatting to the kitchen staff who were busy cleaning surfaces) was trying to get the attention of a restaurant staff but no joy.  I stood up to leave and finally a waiter came over and put down the menus. He spoke virtually NO english at all (similar to the waiter at the poolside again in black how could only point to the menus). 2. Gave my order of a starter and main course. Ended up pointing to the dishes as he could not understand. 3. Order came 15 minutes later but both starter and main course ALL together and water bottle arrived at the same time!4. The main course was WRONG.  The waiter didnt understand and a lady (excellent English speaker) who was very friendly came over showed me the menu and i  pointed to the two dishes i had ordered. She apologised and was VERY professional. She came back with an orange cake and 'very sorry'. So i had had my started by this time and then had the cake.5. Finished and asked for the bill, the CORRECT main course then arrived!!  Both dishes were very good and well presented.Cooling Tower:1. WOW!! Top class. 2. Fabulous - so fabulous that could not get a table on the first night. (hence me having dinner at Tuxedo)3. Second night had dinner there. Planned to be there one hour but ended up staying until the DJ Blackie finished! A bottle or more of wine and a few dishes  later...4. Fabulous mixes with a fabulous blend of golden oldies and up to date music and great tempo. Great vibes.5. Tangmo and Max - a credit to your team. The two hostesses extremely elegant and very well spoken and a delight! Overall the hotel is fabulous; the price we paid was excellent but competition is tough in Bangkok so it will be interesting to see the future prices once (we hope) covid is a thing of the past.Will be back (if you will let me!) during these coming months.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

Service 5/5Rooms 5/5Location 5/5We came straight from the hospital and unknowingly made a good decision choosing this hotel, Had to wait for stitches to come off before going home.Hotel is great, everything is fantastic. Whether it is the reception or clean rooms or house keeping, they are all extremely caring and welcoming. What made us surprise was that everyone in the hotel knew we came from the hospital and were really nice. Room service asked us if we needed to avoid or order specific food in our case. The housekeeping took time to clean our room thoroughly. Khun Lek in the house keeping is very prompt and quick. She has the potential to work twice as others and very quick. The day she comes, we know room cleaning would only take minutes. Even the pool section offered us juices in happy hour which usually you don't. Also Croissant on the ground floor restaurant is too good. We had the chance to meet the lady cheff and say Thank You.They even celebrated our anniversary and Birthday with Beautiful flowers and a hand written card from everyone. Very touching. We love everyone from the bell boy to the housekeeping.Our Dear Khun Pepe, Thank you for arranging those beautiful flowers. This whole year has been affected by covid and what you did for us has been the most memorable moment this year. We enjoyed talking to you everyday until someone had to come and steal you away Dear Khun Palm, You are a lovely person. Very polite and humble. It is an honour to actually meet someone so simple yet intelligent in today. It is rare to find people like you. We wish you and your family all the best and may we always see you smiling.

It was such a treat, as I imagine when covid restrictions are lifted, this hotel will be inundated with tourism and double the price!This hotel is  MUST if you are wanting a luxurious experience, where you truly feel pampered from the moment you enter, to the moment you leave. The location is perfect, just a 5 min walk from the ASOK BTS line, a short walk to Emporium mall and a short BTS line to all the other malls (such as Central World and Siam).In the reception, it also has a sterilising box, to sterilise your belongings if you wish!

51,5.0,"To the point, we very much enjoyed our staycation here. The new hotel and their exceptional staff deserve a five star recommendation. From our well designed/functional hotel room to their multiple restaurant dining venues (we dined at three of them) including Wah Lok (marvelous dimsum), the rooftop Cooling Tower, and the Plate (for a lovely breakfast), we give them ALL and their staff a thumbs up. We loved the live DJ vibes at the rooftop bar.  The workout room is large and well equipped. The very large/long salt-water pool is exceptional. But foremost, as prior reviewers have shared, what stood out most were the earnest service providers from time of arrival to time of departure and at each of the dining venues (including the pool staff too). There were management/staff introductions on arrival, follow-ups during our stay, and again kind follow-ups on our departure (not just to see how we were doing but also to solicit any feedback on improvements).  We can't let this review end without sharing our recognition and hats off to Khun Palm, Khun Boram, Khun Esther, Khun Jenny and Khun Dy ... and to a very endearing bespetacled young man at the pool who so enthusiastically shared helpful insights on the available pool services.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

Right from arrival on check in the staff were superb - they went above and beyond to help with whatever we needed. The room was spotless with nice touches like automatic curtains over our big panoramic window, a Japanese style toilet and Nespresso machine. The bed was very comfortable with very high quality linen and the internet was lightening fast.Only a couple of criticisms from us - the air con was so cold, even set at 26 degrees (we live in Thailand), we were freezing and had to have it turned off most of the time! There wasn't a socket in the bathroom for hair dryers (only for shavers which normal plugs don't fit into) so makes it difficult for ladies to do their hair as there's no other sockets near to a mirror. The universal sockets next to the bed were very stiff, perhaps because they were new, but our 3 pin UK plugs didn't fully fit into them. These are minor criticisms thought, it's an outstanding hotelThe swimming pool is fabulous and huge, the best we have seen in Bangkok. Excellent happy hour and very attentive staff. The gym (although we didn't use it) is very well equipped. Plate restaurant with the set menu lunch was really good value and the food was excellent - we ate here twice.

74,5.0,"We stayed at the Carlton Hotel Bangkok for the 3rd time now. I actually asked my 3-year-old son where he wanted to go for the weekend. Usually, he likes trying new places, but this time he was very determined to go back to the Carlton Hotel.  This doesn't come to a surprise as the staff is great with kids. Especially Mrs Whan at the desk and Khun Win at the Tuxedo Restaurant. Those 2 really manage to be professional and are great with or son. They seem to understand that kids aren't just kids, but they want to be included in all experiences. They make our son feel welcome and feel included as a guest. We had the afternoon delight tea for lunch and were amazed by how delicious every component was. We usually don't eat sweets as we live a keto lifestyle, but we thought we'd give it a try and just taste everything. We ate the whole thing like savages :D it was extremely delicious. Those chefs really really know what they are doing.I also have to give special credits to Yu, Ester, Nhing, and again Whan as a team, as they noticed it was my birthday. They called us to invite us to the rooftop bar for a complimentary birthday drink. We were actually planning to eat out, but as that sounded very inviting we went up for drinks. The rooftop bar was so nice, we decided to stay for dinner and thank god we did! The food was amazing! We all slept like babies in the super comfortable beds. The rooms are designed more convenient than most hotel rooms in Thailand. They've put some thought in efficiency and practicality. The blinds block out all the light and close with a switch instead of manually. No more putting all the pillows you can find in the room to block out the light :) The only thing I'm missing is a plug near a mirror to blowdry and style my hair. That's probably the only thing they missed designing the rooms. Also, a small bin in the bathroom would be more convenient.  But other than those small details it's designed to perfection. The pool is very nice. I love the woodwork they used and the sunbeds are comfortable. The pool bar is great and again, the food is so good!!! There are too many 5 hotels with terrible kitchens. I'm happy that Carton Hotel realizes how important a good inhouse restaurant is! I could probably write a book about all the things I love about the hotel but short summary the pool, the restaurant, the facilities and above all the staff! The staff can make or break your experience and I think the staff of Carlton is well aware of that. Please keep up the good job and we will definitely come back often and be your best advocates.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

It is quite easily one of the best hotels I've stayed in.The rooms are airy, very tastefully decorated and equipped with a really excellent smart TV and home media system. The bathroom is superbly appointed and comfortable. The lighting options in the room are extensive, which I loved, with some beautiful mood lighting that was excellent at night. The bed itself was faultless.Every staff member I interacted with was pleasant, accommodating and smiling. In particular Namwhan, Yu and Esther all left an excellent lasting impression. I really felt like a VIP during my stay. The breakfast was served unlimited but a la carte, and everything was fresh and delicious. The coffee was excellent and the bacon was amongst the best I've been served in SE Asia.The fitness suite was sparkling, clean and very well-appointed, and the pool area is pleasant too. On my first night I also spent time at the Cooling Tower, the bar and restaurant on the top floor. Naturally the views were excellent, but I was also surprised to find the food was impressive too - a light and fresh spinach focaccia washed down with on-tap IPAs, recommended by yet more helpful and attentive staff.I cannot recommend the Carlton more highly.

The beef bourguignon was top notch, and the bar staff, Regade was so polite. The hotel is baby friendly, there was enough space beside the luggage rack to put the baby trolley in the room, and they were kind enough to provide not only the baby cot but also a baby bottle sterilizer and a small baby bathtub.

Opened in 2020, the variety of rooms flagship promises a blend of style, serenity and comfort.And it delivers. Its magnificence is made clear from the second I enter the lobby. A sweeping & spacious floorplan; classic yet contemporary design features and, most resonant, a feeling of familial hospitality which competitors often struggle to achieve. Having arrived with city shrouded in grey, the dazzling interior design is a welcome sight, and thankfully, it’s in no short supply. As I’m escorted to my room by one of Carlton’s expertly-trained team members, I can’t help but notice that no stone has been left unturned and the attention to detail is remarkable. The use of light woods; marble tiling and high ceilings generates a refreshing airiness and palatial spaciousness. Locally crafted fabrics, furniture and art are tastefully displayed alongside modern décor and state-of-the-art appliances. No stuffiness here: a veritable feeling of ease and comfort abounds, giving the sense that these are spaces designed to be lived in and moved through.Undoubtedly one of the biggest drawcards to Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit is its extensive range of dining experiences. With Wah Lok leading the culinary charge as the property’s hallmark Cantonese dining venue, the property also boasts Plate (all day dining) and Tuxedo Espresso Bar (Coffee and pastry) Thanks to the wonderful team at Carlton Hotel Sukhumvit. there is an overwhelming sense of calm permeating The entire hotel.

Another thing is swimming pool, the hotel allow guest to use maximum 2 ppl per hour, you need to make reservation in advance.

I just had to do 1 signature, because all the paperwork was already prepaired and in addition I got an upgrade for a Junior Suite. What a perfect start into my holidays. In my Junior Suite everything needed was already there, not to mention all the amneties and especially the coffee machine from Nespresso. I did not miss any artikel in the room, so what do I want more?If you book an Executive room or higher, then you get access to the Executive Lounge on floor 21, what means everything is included in the room rate and where you can enjoy the meals in a private surrounding, starting by an oppulent and exclusive breakfast buffet, followed by afternnoon tea / coffee with delicious sweets etc until to the excellent drinks in the evening, perfectly accompanied by the very talented employees Zaizy, Chane, Mint, Fang and actual the trainees Cherry and Guy. I also want to say thanks to Jar (reception), Sommon (guest relations) and Ithidaj (guest experience). They all are just heartful people and I felt there very homy during my stay of 10 nights.In addition, I also have to mention the perfectly organised loundry service. If the loundry is placed at the reception until 10 am, you get it back the same day in the late afternoon and believe me, it really works. The loundry is brought back to the room, perfectly wrapped, as you ordered it.Of course, I also want to say thanks to the people, who open the door every time at the maine entrance with a big smile and also the employees at the front desk, changeing also money etc. etc.Last but not least, I also have to talk about the relativ newly renovated fitness room on floor 5. All the training machines I used, worked very well and the rest rooms / changing rooms were clean and I loved specially the rainforest showers.All in all, it was again a perfect stay and I certainly will come again soon. Thanks once more to all the people envolved and I personally know. I appreciate their wonderfull work for me very much.",Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada Hotel,4.5

No park to jog in the morning, although reception was very helpful to give me a map of the neighborhood with several routes and various distances to jog.Break fast was nice.There is a Chinese and a Japanese restaurants in the hotel, which are of good quality and both offer a fixed price buffet. The Japanese place was more casual and hence busier, so not all the dishes came that I ordered.

37,5.0,"I had high expectations and the hotel over delivered.We are platinum Accor and when we booked, 3 months prior we contacted Khun Frank who offered us an early check in. We stayed for 6 nights.Not only did we have an amazing check in experience by Songkran and Dutsadee, but the notes were in the system, we were welcomed and had a room upgrade - a fantastic wow to the start of our stay.It was a pleasure to meet Frank later in our stay - a true ambassador for the hotel.Our room was really quiet and peaceful and our cleaner Sathima always seemed to be able to clean our room whilst we were at breakfast - marvellous.There was also a nightly turndown service.We ate breakfast in the lounge which was so peaceful and relaxing.  The evening cocktails and canapés were also great and we received excellent service from the team - in particular Salinee, Mint, Farm.  It was also a pleasure to talk to Martin who checked on our stay and requirements.The swimming pool was lovely and in the 5th floor with sun for the majority of the day.  Good quality sunbeds and towels. It’s an easy walk to the MRT and The Street Mall, plus a big C. There is a bank next door and 711. The hotel doors are opened for you whenever you walk in or out of the hotel with a cheery greeting and asking whether any assistance was needed.Made to feel very welcome - yet able to relax too !",Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada Hotel,4.5
38,4.0,"Last year I wrote a glowing review of Swissotel Bangkok and I did not feel the need to provide an update until things changed.  Unfortunately I must now report on significant cutbacks at this hotel regarding room Platinum upgrades and happy hour.  Service remains great and breakfast in the lounge is still top notch but going forward my enthusiasm is more tempered about returning.In the past I booked the Executive Suite and received a one-category upgrade to the Crest Suite as Accor Platinum.  For this stay I again booked the Exec Suite and I saw online that the vast majority of room types were available at time of check-in including the Crest Suite, therefore I was surprised to find out at the front desk that we were not getting upgraded.  Staff indicated that they no longer upgrade above the Exec Suite level.  This is disappointing and is akin to the policy we experienced at Banyan Tree Bangkok last year: if you book a suite you won’t get upgraded. In my opinion this is not competitive with other hotel chains where you can book a suite and get upgraded to a premium suite but in any event I can adjust my stay pattern accordingly.  My takeaway is that for stays where I want to book a suite outright there are better places to maximize value where they do not hesitate to upgrade to premium suites.Happy hour in the lounge has been cut back from 2.5 hours to 2 hours (6-8pm) but the most disappointing aspect is what they now offer in the lounge.  Whenever a lounge goes down from luxury appetizers such as oysters to mini-pizzas, that’s quite a fall from grace.  For this stay they also had tonkatsu and sushi but they frequently ran out and were very slow to refill.  We were only about a dozen people in the lounge so it was still quite peaceful and a pleasant environment, and remains superior to the Banyan Tree lounge.  However 12 guests in the lounge is not many – struggling to keep up with refills leaves room for improvement.Breakfast in the lounge remains a strength of this hotel and I did not observe the same cutbacks as for happy hour.  They had seafood fried rice, the cold buffet also had scallops, mussels, and shrimps – very few lounges have such offerings for breakfast.  To go along the buffet they still have an extensive a la carte menu prepared by the chef at the live cooking station; I am glad this has not been taken away.  Fruit selection is also above average: I tend to rate breakfasts higher when they have special fruits such as mangoes and Swissotel ticks the box in that regard; they were so juicy!  The lounge was very peaceful in the morning: only a handful of people were there besides us.  Given that Athenee Luxury Collection Hotel (which is one of the higher end hotels with a lounge in Bangkok) has cut sparkling wine from breakfast in their lounge recently, an argument can be made that as far as lounge breakfasts go, Swissotel is one of the best.Besides food not being replenished fast enough in the evening, service in the lounge remains superb – staff is always friendly and attentive, they recognized us from before and addressed us by name, etc.  Overall I was disappointed by the lack of room upgrade and the now subpar happy hour.  Given that the drawbacks of this property have not gone away (location, aging hardware), I must be more tempered than last time in my assessment of this hotel.  The breakfast and service will bring me back but possibly not as often as before because the recent changes are negative.",Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada Hotel,4.5

Our 'meet and greet' team were so happy to see us and tend to our needs that we felt at home straight away. When we needed a taxi, it was there.  If we were negotiating the road outside, a 'traffic' officer escorted us to safety.  Unbelievable. The check-in staff were efficient and friendly and the staff at the International Buffet and A-la-cart were fantastic. We dined there most days and found everyone from the Food and Beverage Manager, to the Head Chef, Soux Chef and the Floor Manager and her staff, especially 'Sarah' were amazing.

61,1.0,"The Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada must have been a very glamorous hotel in its heyday. It has amenities that back in the 90s must have very much impressed its guests: a centralized control for lighting, air conditioning, and radio; a 'Please wait' button next to the toilet to politely ask visitors for patience in case you were thus engaged; and a hi-fi sound system complete with CD and tape players. The vintage feel, however, extends to the rest of the facilities - carpets and upholstery are tired and stained, the in-room air conditioning is noisy with an ineffective thermostat (freezing when on, sweltering when off, neither bearing any link with the temperature setting), and like the rings of a tree-trunk, you can probably date the fixtures through the layers of crusted dust. The kindness of the staff, low price-point for the hotel category, and the location for some meetings, makes up for it. What I couldn't really get over was finding a (dead) bug pressed between my bedsheets on my first night, which means that this went through a washer, dryer, and ironing process without the bug being found. More disturbing, though, was finding a reasonably large nail fragment under the edge of my bed when checking nothing rolled under it upon check-out.This is probably a one-off experience, but I will avoid this hotel in the future if I can.

The bath tub was huge which made the feeling of nice holiday so much stronger. Close to high end restaurants, bars and shopping if that's what one is looking for, but also close to metro to go someplace else as Sukhumvit is maybe not the most interesting area when looking for cultural or historical experiences. Service was great! Only downside was the breakfast which was rather dull with few options and not reaching my expectations of a more high end hotel. ","Hotel Verve, Bangkok",4.5

33,5.0,"Rooms (Grand Deluxe room type): Extremely new hardware, everything is in good condition. More than sufficient space for 2 adults. Toiletary fittings are Toto brand, and toiletries are a good local brand (cannot remember which one exactly). That being said, the toilet bowl did get clogged during our stay (flush was quite weak before and after the clog, not as strong as I am used to), which maintanence team fixed quickly.Breakfast: We opted for the room package with breakfast inclusive. The breakfast is buffet style, with a relatively average spread. Enough to fill the stomach, but nothing to write home about.Location: Short walk from Thonglor BTS, directly beside Hotel Nikko (which might be a better landmark for Grab or taxi pickup / drop off location). Taxi driver from airport did miss the entrance a couple of times as it doesn't face the main road. Family Marts (convenience store chain) located relatively near both the front and back entrances of the hotel. Hotel is located a few steps from Bo.Lan, one of the best known high end Thai restaurents.

No inform before check-in or make the booking. From 10am-4pm, banging noise are everywhere; lobby, or in the room.Service .. no standard on hygiene. Our room was open before check in normal. Other room will have the certificate showing about the room is clean what quality check with a sticker on the door. So no sticker on our room. It was ok as covid in Thailand is not that bad. I was ask for baby cot, housekeeper bring it and did not were a mask, but when we went for breakfast without mask. We were ask to wear mask, ... standard?, we were told that mask was provided in the room. “Nothing is provided”. We went back and get our own mask. When we finish our breakfast. Other guests can entering the breakfast area without the mask. Where is the standard???In the Breakfast, hygiene was there. Water was provided behind the bar, but no one there.

Additionally, TRUST ME and get a Traditional Thai massage while you are there.  It was the best massage I've ever gotten and the price was great.  I got it on our last night and tried to schedule another one for the morning before I left, but they were booked up.  Honestly, I am tempted to go back to Thailand just for a massage at this hotel.  The restaurant Suan Bua at the hotel was really subpar.  We were the first people there when it opened, and it still took us over 2 hours to eat and get our check.  We asked for our check and a dessert to go simultaneously, and it took 30 minutes (we timed it) to get both.  We were falling asleep at the table and so ready to go back to our room!The pool is beautiful but the hot tub was broken.  We were excited to go sit in the hot tub after a long day, but it was cold when we got down there!We went up to the rooftop restaurant (which is a French bistro), but it wasn't anything special so we didn't eat up there.

I had 2 separate bookings and requested to maintain in the same room. I understand it is subjected to availability but the way Hsiao-Min rejected me without even checking. This frustrates me. She even squinted at Kotchaporn with an irritated and agitated look. Is this the kind of service you put at the front desk to represent your Hotel? More importantly, is this the kind of hospitality Thailand offers? The land of smiles? On the other hand, Naruth, Kotchaporn and the morning Trainee was very friendly and professional.The pillow quality is inconsistent.

I showed the staff my destination clearly on a google map. But the taxi driver tried to take me to a different place farther away.

50,5.0,Stayed here with my wife as part of a four centre trip to Thailand. Primary reason for visit was a friend’s traditional Thai wedding in Bangkok and chose this hotel for its proximity to the wedding venue. Can not fault the hotel facilities or the staff who were always friendly and helpful. Not necessarily convenient for the major tourist attractions and worth bearing in mind that for large parts of the day the traffic will double the time for most taxi journeys. Use the Grab app and book a car rather than a taxi as it is fixed price. Breakfast is amazing. Also ate at the international buffet one evening with the choice being superb and catering for all tastes. Hotel is attached to the huge central plaza shopping centre with lots of food choices. For me another plus was the close proximity of two parks for running in. Recommended ,Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok Hotel,4.5

My only complaint with this hotel is the lifts, the lifts worked fine, BUT every time one of the lifts was called / arrived it let off a loud ""bing bong"" noise to announce its arrival. Not a problem during the day but all through the night intensely annoying. Bearing in mind that this hotel is used as an airport hotel, including cabin crew staying here, there are guests coming and going through the day and night. Management really need to go and spend some time sitting in a room near to the lifts and see how frequent and loud that ""bing bong"" is, why does it need to be that loud? Why cant it be silenced through the night?

Pulled up to the front and was told by security that could not drive up to front unloading area as an artist was about to leave for concert nearby and that I should wait patiently in the front of the hotel...10 minutes go by and no word. I start to see my parking is causing congestion, so I decide to go park in the parking garage instead, as no big deal, understand a concert is occurring. Fast forward to when I am checking out and my son is having his after non nap. He obviously likes to sleep a lot :) So call down to the front desk and ask them if we can postpone 1 hour on checkout and tell them the little one is sleeping. Put on hold and told, apologies there are a ton of guests going to check in and cannot accommodate the request. We go down to check and do not see these ton of guests that was supposed to be checking in.

19,3.0,"We stayed in this hotel because we are a loyal ACCOR Hotel member and because my typical teen daughter wanted a ""shopping"" birthday spree at Siam Square.  Since it was our FIRST TIME in this hotel, we initially booked for 1 night, because we really didn't know what to expect. But..... because the hotel rate was inexpensive, we stated our intentions to the FO Manager during check-in of staying for an additional 2 to 3, depending on my daughter's wishes. Apparently,  we only lasted ONE night. ON-CALL, BEFORE CHECK-IN:3-STAR- I reserved for a room via phone call. That went smoothly and hassle-free! - I asked if we could request a surprise birthday cake for my daughter. The receptionist said they couldn't give us one, even if we paid for it since they needed a 3-day notice. - The receptionist however hinted that they could arrange a birthday surprise when we were already there. - BUT, NOTHING.  Sad.CHECK-IN: 3-STAR- NO welcome drinks. - NO greetings. - NO smiles. - A staff was whispering to another, as though (from an outsider's POV looked like she was ""gossiping"" or not.  - Another lady had a mask but was dangling it from one ear.  ️️THE ONLY PERSON WHO MADE A DIFFERENCE was The FO Manager, Khun Ja. She was very accommodating, gave the proper guidelines on the wifi usage, room no., breakfast time, etc. She also spoke very good English. Sadly, she wasn't present when we checked-out.WIFI:0-STAR -We tried using the wifi, and attempted on several devices BUT RECEIVED ZERO CONNECTION. Junior Suite ROOM:4-STAR- LARGE and LOTS OF SPACE!- has an iron stand and iron- blowdryer- basic toiletries- 2 bottles of FREE water - loved the lighting- 2 large TV sets- very soft sofa bed that we converted into a bed! - loved this!- loved the 2 large chairs!!!- 1 small working desk- safe- 2 pairs of slippers- 2 bathrobes- tons of towels - loved this!- doorbell*Perhaps a center rug may look nice on an almost empty-looking space would do the trick.HOUSEKEEPING:5-STAREXCELLENT! Very quick to respond and very friendly. - I forgot to wear my mask outside the room - a housekeeping staff reminded me in the most friendly and respectful way. - I requested for an extra pillow - received 2 pillows instead, so was rewarded with a generous tip from my husband. BREAKFAST:3-STAR- We were greeted with words and WITHOUT a smile. - We gave our room no. and we ushered ourselves inside since we weren't guided. - No big deal though, since there weren't many inside the restaurant.- The staff were very friendly towards each other, we even saw the Restaurant Receptionist walk hand in hand (fingers interlocking) with the Chef (wearing a black top)- I smiled at all of the staff, who I encountered only to receive blank stares. - Again, no big deal. Maybe, they weren't trained to smile.  And, they were obviously, busy. Except for a lady named ""Khun Pump"" who smiled at everyone and was busy paying attention to all the ""foreign"" looking guests, except for my family who looked very Asian. ️️The ONLY man I would like to commend was the man who had a stroke. HE WAS THE ONLY MAN WHO KEPT A SMILE ON HIS FACE AND WAS ATTENTIVE, DESPITE BEING VERY BUSY!!! Despite the fact, that he only had one active hand (since the other hand had decreased strength and dexterity due to your stroke), he was actively pacing back and forth, making sure that all the areas were clean, checking the food, cooking and cleaning countertops. HE SHOULD BE GIVEN A SERIOUS RAISE!!!! POOL:4-STAR- A very large pool!!!! - My kids and I were happy to have done a lot of lapses here. - Very Very Clean!- OFF POINTS: the pool bar is close, the pool is not ""new' - But, who cares, t'was very very clean!!!  HAPPY-HOUR at the LOUNGE:5-STAR- FREE FOOD and DRINKS!!!- UNLIMITED: Garlic Mussels, Chicken Nuggets, and Fried Wonton Balls- FREE-FLOWING: Pineapple Cocktail and Beer- The Filipino Musicians were awesome! - They received a generous tip from my husband. - The waiters were attentive, warm, and informed us of the ""last call"". - Their awesomeness was rewarded with again, a generous tip from my husband. LOCATION:5 stars!!CLEANLINESS:5 stars!!!LOBBY LOUNGE:5 stars!!!ROOM:4 starsPOOL:4 starsGYM & SPA:didn't pay those a visit GUEST RELATION:3 starsFRONT OFFICE RECEPTION:2 starsDO I SEE THIS PLACE AS OUR SECOND HOME?- Not yet. - Though this place is a far cry from our very loved MERCURE (a hotel we've been going to for the past 10 years), it may still be worth another try. Let's see!!! I WILL DEFINITELY WRITE ABOUT IT AGAIN!!! WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE?- I would actually since I believe that this place may still improve and the location is a plus!",Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0

ALL the staff, from concierge to restaurant to tour serviced to housekeeping -- every single one will bend over backwards to help you. I have turned up way before check-in time, departed way after check-out time, and if a room is not available they always provide somewhere to shower/freshen up; and the lobby sitting area is wonderfully comfortable, with isolated cosy spots that allow comfort and privacy.The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable; with complementary drinking water and tea+coffee makings; kettle and blowdrier.A a female travelling alone, the safety of the area and ease of commute are big deals for me.  The BTS links to the Airport Rail line, and you are literally from the hotel check-out desk to the airline check-in desk in one hour.

The concierge helped us to contact the airlines and tried their best to resolve the matter. Though their attempts were unsuccessful, I appreciate their gd efforts. Just before we left for the airport, we were also impressed by the hotel’s gesture of placing some croissant, danish juices and hot beverages for guests who have to leave earlier than hotel’s official breakfast time.

We can get the room within 15 minutes despite in the very early morning. He has a good service mind and good manner. Politely speaking is his outstanding charisma. We did not expect such impressive welcome because we thought Novotel may prefer Chinese or foreigner than Thais but we totally wrong.

Room was adequate. Stayed in 1502. The first night it had a rather unpleasant smell in it. I put it down to the sewage system. Smell disappeared the next day. Bathroom was a little grubby and in need of some maintenance. Bed comfortable and large. Plenty of space and a lovely city view. Good housekeeping. Breakfast was fine. Not awesome but adequate and very busy. Bar in the evening was good. Excellent selection of gin. Very impressive. Overall a nice stay. ,Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0

83,4.0,"Novotel Siam Square is probably the best located hotel in Bangkok if you like a location near a convenient BTS station and central malls.  From the Siam Station, if you prefer not to carry your luggage down the stairs, you could use the escalators in the Siam Square One Mall.  The area around the hotel is a little untidy with motor cycle parking and not completely covered drains.    The hotel lobby has a funky vibe but is looking a little tired.   Our queen room was of a decent size, modern in design,  and most amenities were provided (kettle, slippers, bottled water etc).   The only issue of note was that the room was rather dimly lit though they corrected it by trolleying in a large lamp.  I also appreciated that they remembered my birthday with cake and congratulatory cards – which was a nice touch.Nearby is the Siam Relax Massage (reasonable prices, skilled masseuses) though I can’t vouch for their hygiene practices like cleaning chairs after each client etc.",Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0

Basic courtesy  issues from the staff and they ask customers to pay extra for no reason, they don’t understand language (which they should try to work and improve upon, especially in a hotel which has a global reputation.1) The breakfast area where food was served had cockroaches roaming around2) room is not cleaned up in time and staff says they had lot of rooms to clean up, such a lame excuse3) they want to charge double for room service despite the rates being clearly mentioned on the room service menu, the staff is totally pathetic and then they serve half quantity liquor ordered in the room4) they want to charge extra for providing  breakfast box ( when I have taken up the room with breakfast and paid for it), they serve, overall a bad experience. 5) No body lotions provided in the room (first time seen at Novotel), And got everything the staff just says sorry for everything but does nothing at all.

97,4.0,"Staff was very welcoming and friendly. They arranged to combine both my bookings such that I didn't need to change rooms after the first night. However, the room allocated to me was twin bed room with a toilet design flaw. In essence, when closing the window to the shower, the main room is able to see the toilet and when closing the toilet, the main room is able to see the shower. This made no sense especially with people sharing a twin room. Spoke to the duty manager and they managed to move me another room where the toilet had no issues with privacy the following morning. Appreciate the quick and prompt service recovery. Other than this incident, the stay was great. Location was very near the Siam BTS station (2 min walk) and lots of food options / malls. Siam Paragon was just next to the BTS station and had a supermarket. Overall, I will choose to stay in this hotel again for price and convenience. However, I will make sure that the staff does not allocate me the same room as my first night here. Great job to the team for the surprise birthday cake and decorations as well. Really appreciate it.

98,3.0,"I am visiting this hotel since merely twenty years, mainly due to its location. This time was  very mixed experience.Check in took twenty minutes, despite nobody in front of me. Just slow staff. Finally reaching the room, both provided key cards didn't function,and the door could not be opened. Returned to reception, after further ten minutes, I had two new keys, which worked.Due to my status, I received welcome drinks vouchers for the bar. Pretty much to my surprise, I was told, today no beer on stock - can you imagine ? Only imported brands, but those not on voucher. However, next day local beer on voucher was available.Thought over the years, I would know ll the room types, and wouldn't need adapters s three pin sockets be available. However, when doing work, I realized, this room is not fitted with it. Went down to the business centre to get one, and was told, room service would bring one to my room. Nothing during the next 45 minutes. Went down to the business centre again, to get it there. It took the staff there another twenty minutes to get it.The gym is clearly dated. Most of the free weights and machines showing corrosion, though still in usable condition. However, the swiss balls haven't been pumped up for years, and can't be used anymore. Had informed the staff during my previous visit, but obviously to no avail.The room was clean, the bed excellent. But details in the bathroom showing the age too. E.g. corroded holders for sop in the shower, visible raw plugs and small damages on the mirror.Conclusion : it's time for some improvements ! ... But I'll go there again.",Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0
