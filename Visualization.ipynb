Rooms are quite small but comfortable, more suitable for staycay people who don’t need much space or don’t stay indoors all the time. Be careful when taking up their early check in request as encountered their staff biting back at me for checking in early when I requested for late check out as my family and I are heading out on check out day and was afraid might not come back in time to check out so asked as a precaution.', 'comfortable and cozy room with great lightning in room. Huge window for city view and good ambience to enjoy a shower with those stunning view. Despite room size is smaller then average but many factors overcome this tiny down side. ', \"Hotel location is convenient walking distance to Orchard shopping. Rooms are too small but compact which want we need, only thing not comfortable is the mattress and pillows too soft (should improve on these). Service crew are polite and friendly ! If got promo don't mind to come again.\", 'Overall experience is ok. Good location, clean, great staff & new experience with robot. Just room is really small and not worthwhile to upgrade. Not suitable for family with young kids unless you are willing to pay for experience. ', 'The room is clean. For location wise, it is very accessible    to varieties for food. Located near to shopping malls and Orchard MRT as well. The staffs were very friendly. Checking in/out is very simple. would consider to come back for another round for staycation.', 'Checked in on good friday. Took around 2hrs to check in due to the long queue..Room is very clean i would say, everything is working well..bed is cool able to adjust. Easy to connect laptop to TV with HDMI cable to watch youtube & disney+. Room is just nice for 2 pax, would definitely book here again!', 'No complaints on the location. It is very assessable to all big shopping malls.  The room is pleasant. good for solo or couple staycation the view is great due to the high floors. the internet is stable and fast.  ', 'Booked this hotel after reading the many good reviews left by guests.   Many thanks to the hotel to accommodate our request for adjoining rooms, the early check-in, and the birthday surprise delivered by Yolanda.  Many thanks also to Eswari and Aldrina for the patience shown in clarifying the parking charges. S$21.40 for a single-use exit pass regardless of the number of hours/days stayed.   The location of this hotel is very good. There are many big shopping malls and food establishments right beside it. The MRT is very nearby too.   The room layout is somewhat unconventional with the bathroom located right against the exterior windows. This means guests have to choose between privacy or good view and natural light.  It also means lots of curtains up/down. It will take some…', 'Great cool hotel for a staycation.  It is so convenient to walk everywhere on orchard road!  Though the room is a little small, the high floor makes up for it!  The breakfast was straight forward and quick service!  I love to hang out for drinks another time!', \"Views of Orchard Road were nice although it was troublesome to have to lower the blinds every time I needed to use the toilet.  Although futuristic, I was very disappointed by the bed.  When it was flat, I could feel a depression where the 'bend' of the mattress occurs.  It led to a very uncomfortable night's sleep.  For those who are sensitive to their mattresses, you may want to give this place a miss.\", 'Awesome team at hotel. Complementary early check in and check out via self service touchscreen.  Clean and cosy room. Near Orchard MRT, Shopping Mall and cinema. 24 hrs cafe round the corner and 24hr convenient shop near by. Decent breakfast', 'The hotel is suitable for family. The location is fantastic. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family. Will come back again with my family. Although the room is small, it is cosy and compact.', 'Soft beds, breakfast not fantastic, gym size can put about 5pax, love the complimentary early check in, nice staff and free flow of water.

It is super convenience, cozy and totally love the view. Would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. I wouldnt mind coming to this hotel again!', 'Love the view at night from the shower area. Efficient layout for a small room roughly 14-16sqm. Amenities will good. Towels are clean, sheets are clean, bed are super soft. Its a happy place with purple grey theme. Similar to M social but much better.', 'It was a convenient and not over-priced hotel to consider within the heart of Orchard. With minimum contact, they have 2 cute robot, Yolanda and Yoshi to do the errands. Room is just big enough for 2 to 3 pax. Otherwise get the bigger room.', 'Overall the hotel room is quite decent.

There are 610 rooms. Parking is $20 per day or $3 per hour entry. There are 30 floor. Room temperature can only be set between 21 to 24 degree. You can ask for extra towel, mineral water, shaving kit again. Reception lobby and drop off area is located at level 2.   During check in you have to scan the qr code. Then the staff would direct you to the counter and assist you to check in. Need to fill up form and write in your full nric number (not last 4 digits) and date of birth. This is for all guests and visitors. Room floor and room number is already assigned to you. Similar to airline self check in system where you can't choose the floor or room. The lobby is like a touch and go station. No seat or sofa like other 4* and 5* hotels in Singapore.…\", 'My family and I enjoyed our stay and we appreciate that we were assigned connecting rooms. That was a nice touch. Thank you for the complimentary early check in as well! We got to start our plans early. Wouldn’t mind making a second trip to Yotel in future. :)', \"This is one of the nicest hotel I've been in and I've stayed at expensive five star hotels before. Of course you shouldn't expect the greatest facilities or a huge room for the price you're paying. But the room is frankly amazing. I will definitely be coming back here\", 'We were very impressed with d way breakfast was served as we did not have good service or food at Carlton Hotel.We were served by mdm Eileen who anticipated our needs even before we asked. The staffs at reception are very young but respectful.', 'Generally ok. Cups for brushing teeth not provided. Wireless screen mirroring intermittently disconnected.

Cool, though not interactive.', 'Overall our 3D2N staycay experience was splendid and we enjoyed our stay in Yotel greatly. It was value for money and location is great as well. It was a birthday celebration for my partner.  We are thankful for the complementary early check in given and the great service by the staff. The room is small but we are not bothered by it as the toilet make it up for space and view. A robot- Yolanda came up to sing my partner a birthday song with macarons and card signed by the staff.  The gym experience was just good as well. It was an enjoyable stay and we would love to come back again next time. We love the robot too. :) ', 'Quite as okay hotel for its price. But the shower is not suitable for 3 people. Should at least provide an extra blind outside the toilet to prevent others from looking inside while others are showering. As people may mistake this as a hotel made for couples for other purposes.', 'Choose the hotel as we have errands to run in orchard and the price was within budget. However, in the end we paid $40+ for parking. Which we can stay in a better hotel. No housekeeping done when we were out. Overall, not value for $ and definitely our last visit', 'Good location in orchard. Very accessible to ion, taka, shaw, tangs and many more. Room was very small. Cool bed.

Toilet is of good size, no need to shower beside the toilet bowl getting it wet and enough leg space in front of toilet bowl.  Wifi is easy to connect and fast. TV has free to air channels and many cable channels. You can also cast from your device to it with simple instructions on the TV provided.

Front desk staff…', 'Checked into this property with the purpose of having it as a staycation session for my boyfriend and I. We stayed here for 2 days and 1 night (checked in on 23/03 and checked out on 24/03). The rooms are beautiful, cozy and neat and the location of this property are conveniently accessible for transportation, shopping and for looking for food places.

Will definitely stay here again.', 'Wanted to simply stay here due to the robots. Specially called to request for some small items to be delivered to us and I can say definitely the highlight of our trip.   Room wise-we know it is small. 3 adults to move around, it is a squeeze...but can’t complain as we know that’s what we have signed up for. Bathroom was okie, just that I think you need to be highly comfortable with one another as somehow, you would be able to the a bit of the silhouette of the person in the bathroom. At least it wasn’t an issue for us.   Bed was very soft. Need to find spots with not so soft bed. But number of pillows was definitely enough.   Highly recommended if you only need the hotel to sleep and rest.

I came across Yotel Orchard, which is in a nice location in Orchard, and it seems like a cool hotel, with the futuristic theme. The price was reasonable considering, it can sleep 3 persons and come with breakfast as well. We arrive slightly later at 3pm to check in, and there was no crowd in the lobby. We used the mission-control (manned counter) to check in, and pay an additional top up for the overnight parking which came up to be $21.40.  After checking in, we went to the 10th floor to book the time slot for the swimming pool. The pool is quite small, and with children playing in it, you have to watch where you swim.  The room was nice and clean,…', 'Located in the central area of orchard. The room is so cool. Breakfast is limited choices but it tastes yummy. The mission control team sent the robot to sing the birthday song for us which is so memorable during the stay. Thanks Yotel.', \"First Class Queen room - The Room was extremely small, not worth the price paid. There wasn't enough space to even open my luggage. The room was very small, the bathroom was extremely small. And the deck is not clean.\", 'The bed is quite comfortable but the space is a bit cramp. If booked 2 rooms with connecting rooms, the interconnect doors are not able to stay opened. There is no stopper provided.

Do check out the expiry dates of the items in the room, as some may be expired or near expiry. The overall staying experience is just ok.', 'Enjoy my staycation. First time i book this hotel. The bed is very comfortable...can watch my favourite korean show..they provide hair dryer n ironing stuff. The shampoo n conditioner is a quality one. Hope to comeback again. ', 'Thank you team Yotel from the front desk to the komyuniti restaurant team. Everyone was helpful and took great care of my family with my mother in the wheelchair.  We got early checkin as our connecting room was ready about an hour before the scheduled check in time. Received a sweet surprise from Yolanda for our birthday boy and enjoyed the pool for the 2 nights stay. Proximity to amenities in the surrounding area means no shortage of food and activity...we even caught a midnight movie on our last night stay. And singapore being so efficient, everything was a grab away. But once again thank you team Yotel. You guys are awesome. My mother and kids gives a sign of approval so we will definitely come back. Highly recommended. Ps, remember to bring down the blinds when you want to…', 'Reason is simple, made a request for check out at 1pm was rejected. And then when I ask how about checking out slightly after 12noon, even like 1205, person name Sahrul on the phone at the front desk say NO.  Enough said for NOT accommodating for simple request', 'If you are planning a family staycation for 3 (8-10yo) and are able to and willing to afford the First Class suite for 2N ( no more ) this is an option. Suite is ok for 2.5 people no more than 3 adults, windows are ceiling to floor in the showerstall so lower those blinds or prepared to flaunt what you got! Be either early (before 8am or after 955/10ish am to avoid breakfast crowd) as minimally staffed. OK for the one off experience but not Round 2 for us.', 'Check-In was done in a swift. Staff at Mission Control was really friendly and explained clearly on the details, clauses. Room service was also efficient, met Yolanda, the robot :D Definitely made my day. Called in to Komyuniti to order some food to dine in the room before checking out. Despite several return calls due to some technical issues, not much delay to my hungry stomach, kudos to that! Food quality was good and thanks to all the prompt and good service, it made my staycation a really good one.

A lot of eateries and shopping ccentres.  Been to many places particular Emerald hill,  Orchard gateway library and wheelock 卓尔bookshop. ', 'Check in was relatively easy. Acdonia (can’t rmb exactly) was very helpful and friendly and full of smiles. Cabins are small but location is good. With rediscover vouchers, definitely made it value for money.

The room was cosy, compact, very clean and well equipped with amenities and we were impressed by the special delivery by their cute robot, Yolanda.  ', 'Extremely warm and friendly welcome from Mission Control! Room was cosy and well-equipped. Urban skincare co. range pampered our hair and body throughout the weekend. Apart from occasional kids running and shouting along corridor, no other noise were heard from neighbouring cabins.

However, the bed was too soft so did not really sleep very well and also, should consider having non smoking balconies so those who cannot take second hand smoke can have the option of choosing that. If not, if the next door cabin guests smoke at their balcony, it will cause discomfort to those who do mind the second hand smoke. ', 'Booked this hotel for a family staycation of 3 adults.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were welcomed by a clean, quiet and sleek view of the lobby - self service kiosks on the left, robots on the right and service counters in front of us.

Just that the aircon is not cold enough when we are sleeping and the swimming pool water is icy cold for me.', 'With the floor to ceiling bathroom windows in their cabins, the shower experience at Yotel was probably the most memorable. Their cabins were very simple, functional and fulfil their brand promise of only focusing on providing the essentials. I slept well on their mattress. Though I have to say that service standards here are rather unremarkable. The purple lighting used around the property serves as quite a backdrop for the now necessary Instagram shot when on staycation. Check-in and out was quick and smooth without much hassle. Recommended if you are just looking for a self-sufficient, simple and value for money staycation experience in a time when leisure overseas travel is practically not possible.', 'This is one of the best hotel I have stayed in Singapore.

Once the toilet door is closed, it is really that’s it! A cabin! ', 'Positives: Great location, good food and quiet room. Will be back for short staycation at the crossroad of Orchard and Scotts roads! Negatives: Mattress too soft for me and lack of storage in the room.

Despite room size is small, everything in the room is neat and tidy.  Given a nice city view in the toilet but don't forget to bring down the bind before you do your business. Room door is thick thus i did not hear any noise from the hotel corridor. Nice smart bed that you can adjust the angle while watching TV on bed. Water pressure from shower head is good but the only issue i have is the glass toilet door.

I would recommend friends to try Yotel for a staycation.', 'My kids loved Yoshi and Yolanda very much. Only thing is that Yolanda sings a goodbye tune but Yoshi just say good bye. Thus its better to get the female robot to deliver items to the room. It was raining in the 3 days we stayed there thus the water in the swimming pool was cold. But that did not stop the kids from going into the pool when the rain stopped for a while. Overall the kids enjoyed themselves.

Walkable to most shopping malls in Orchard. Friendly service and love Yolanda and Yoshi. Highly recommend.', 'I love the view, style and amenities of Yotel. Great location to access Orchard and train stations. When the hotel first opened the beds were in great condition, but recent visits shows the bed have sunken quite a bit. They missed out to replenish some amenities but were quick to recover after a call. As for their front liners, service seriously varies greatly from one another. The way they communicate COVID measures were not the most tactful. They have self-automated machines but at the end still require a staff to assist you or else end up diverting you to the counters, not a very smart check in after all.', 'My husband and I booked a 3d2n stay to celebrate the New Year countdown to 2021. The room was very clean and I really liked the retractable bed. We had a high floor hence we had a good view of the orchard area surroundings.

Could hear people walking and talking in the corridors easily. Breakfast needs to seriously be improved though. The serers were very welcoming and polite with warm smiles, however the western and asian breakfasts should be served hot. It was barely lukewarm.

The auntie in charge of room sanitation is friendly, helpful and quick when we asked for fresh pillow cases.   The cons are hairdryer doesn’t work, dated decor and furnishings, poor soundproofing, secondhand smoke from neighbours on the balcony. It’s a non smoking hotel but people flout the rules, which isn’t the hotel’s fault but dampens the experience. I can hear my neighbours quarrelling at night and loud traffic below. The mattress is not the most comfortable. Ordinary facilities. The central AC is in need of a deep cleanse.', \"I was at a 5 and 6 star hotels before heading to Hotel Boss with my family. Out of the 3 hotels, Mr Kar Heng left me the deepest impression in terms of service excellence. Professional and is sincere when attending to guests.

Ironing facilities are provided in a separate place.  The only reason why I’m deducting one star is the room size - if you come with large luggages, as people normally do when travelling Asia, you might want to consider a much bigger than their standard room which will cost more I imagine.

I was looking forward to a cable channel but was disappointed when I was told that at this time no cable channels (when I was really looking forward to watch all cable channels available)  Internet connection is rubbish , I had to call twice! (3rd time I was able to fix it myself) for someone to fix it as I cannot watch tv (otherwise local channels) as Youtube is directly connected on tv. Room service isn't that good too, I need to do a follow up call a few time as time had passed already and I still don't received my request. And another…\", '1500 rooms and 20 longchairs at the pool, you do the maths...\"come to queue every hour\" told me the staff! Like if I wanted to spend my holiday queueing!! Covid-19 is the excuse the hotel uses to justify one of many lies: queueing at the pool (no booking possible), our family room looks like a dark closet, the noise on the balcony gives the feeling to be on a highway... Nice job done on Internet to make up the reality! Cant\\' wait the breakfast, it should surely be an \"interesting\" experience.', 'Managed to check in early as per informed by Reservation. Location is good. Bad experience when check in. Was served by Chris at the reception. Attitude is super lousy & Impolite. Never inform about the lunch or dinner included as mention when Reservation made. Also never mention about late check out which was mention in the reservation email by hotel boss. Only upon asked, his reply is \"have lah\" & \"have lor\". Other hotel staff are more polite. Especially those at lobby area. Room is small and price is average. Lunch set also cannot make it. Chicken chop n fish fillet is cut into half of actual size. Room have smoking smell. Especially in toilet. ', \"Meena clean our room very good. She's very approachable and thoughtful.

The lady was kinda rude and rushing to finish attending to me. It was my birthday and my family was looking forward to this staycation. Definitely not happy with the service given. Need to improvise. I know it’s on full occupancy and there were too many guests but atleast some smiles are good enough.   Rooms was in a decent size, all clean and in good condition. Did get a low floor but it’s okay. Tv was good with youtube. View was beautiful.  Jubilious restaurant served halal food and it’s great! Pool was huge and looks clean.   Overall I would rate 5 stars if not for the rude and unpleasant service from a few front desk employees...

My friend and I just needed a break from work to detox our minds. The location is awesome as we are surrounded by different kinds of eateries and the malls and bus stop and train stations are in walking distance. Upon arrival at the hotel, the check in was a breeze and the staff was so friendly. When I went up to my room, the room was clean but due to my friends medical condition, the room was not satisfactory. I went to the lobby and met staff Ryan.

Any last minute booking in Singapore would have cost a bomb but Hotel Boss was priced very reasonably.  We were checked in by Hidayah who was friendly despite being swamped with a super long queue at check in. We got two rooms a triple and a superior double. very ample for a family or three children aged 13, 11 and 5.   Hotel itself was clean. facilities like the swimming pool was as well.

This time around I've decided once more to try a 2 nights retreat to recharge and relax away from my rented place. This hotel is also memorable for me since it is one of my go to hotels  to book whenever I have loved ones visiting. Firstly, the price is right on the spot for a 4 star hotel which is not too expensive. I booked their promo for 2 nights which costs me only 188 SGD including tax. Secondly, I personally loved their lobby with the big grand chandelier but I missed the Gloria Jean's coffee right inside it. Their restaurant at the lobby is also closed.

It is easy to get food and there is tons of options.to get food delivery around the area.   Room is pretty small but suffice for a night rest away from hotel and work destress.   However, checking in was horrendous.  I am appalled by the service that were given by the concierge service.  Zero empathy.

We were not informed that the pool and gym were not available before and after booking, nor informed upon checking in. The purpose of opening up staycation package post COVID19 clearly is for patron to chill in the hotel and use the facilities. Else, are we suppose to just rot in the room? Have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area. Closing the facilities due to COVID19 measures shouldn't be a valid reason since most hotels have already open them up to the users. Avoiding essential information on the booking page is a form of misrepresentation. Good luck to you.\", 'I enjoyed my staycation here. The hotel is exceptionally clean and the location is perfect as there are nearby eateries.

We said okay. However when we came back at 2pm, reminded that we booked for a city view, to have high floor, the staff Zin insist that there was no more high floor unit and gave us a 6th floor unit.

My room was a standard twin bed. There was no space to move after placing two large bags of my friend and mine. The room had a window which was as good as nothing.

The lobby also could do with more sofa to provide some “focus” and also for the guests families members to take a seat while one of them is checking in.   Despite 8-9 counters functioning, the check-in still took half an hour at an off-peak 1pm timing but hey, this was the school holidays in a staycation craze year so I was in a way lucky when they informed me to check in at a 1pm timing.

Vibrant and feels like holiday (though is a staycation)', 'Location was very accessible and convenient. fort canning MRT is nearby and very close walking distance to Clarke quay as well. However, there is construction going on near the hotel and was able to hear faint drilling noises. Had to keep the tv on to drain out the construction sound. One downside is that my family & I booked 2 rooms and they were nice enough to give side by side. But one of the room’s toilet cannot lock. Staff should have checked before letting it out. Didn’t change rooms and it was only a one night staycay and won’t do much damage to us. ', 'The hotel location is convenient where it sits right smack in the middle of downtown. It is near to amenities such as restaurants, shopping mall and a public park. If you like the river view, this is one of the better choices to stay where the hotel overlooks the Singapore River.

The waiter and manager was no proactive enough, seems like they were not interested to serve us. Food was horrible too', 'I originally booked the deluxe room and was pleasantly surprised when I got upgraded upon check-in. The hotel location and price was very attractive. The view out from my window at night was superb and one I will not forget.

Overall we had a good stay and will definitely recommend Park Hotel as a staycation destination to our friends and family.', 'This is on the whole a pleasant hotel with pleasant staff except for the faulty aircon that we had in our room. The room we had had a nice view of the pool and cleanliness was decent. Pillows could be fluffier and the fridge could be colder. A bidet for the toilet would be great too. But we were most bothered by the aircon that was faulty. The breakfast was also expensive as they no longer serve a la carte buffet. One dish for $20 is not cheap! We could have gotten better meals outside. ', 'Great stay. Service was excellent. Check in & check out were very smooth. Would love to stay again. Would also recommend to family & friends.

The rooms were generally clean, apart from some stains on the bedsheet and pillow cases. Not a big deal as a quick call for housekeeping resolved this issue rather quickly. The best part of this stay had to be the pool. It was huge (by hotel standards) and suitable for lap swimming. The pool area was also pretty. Loved those pillars around the pool. I think they are Roman inspired. Really contributes to the aesthetics of the place.  However, not everything was perfect about the stay. The most glaring negative was the breakfast.

With covid-19 pandemic Park Hotel Clark Quay don't seem to realise how important it is to have one' backside to be washed clean than to just using soap. Of course the management can always reasoned that it can be done inside the shower but really??? How inconvenient and unhygienic to wash your filty backside inside a shower. BIGET is the most practical, convenient and hygienic way to wash your backside inside a toilet bowl before it being flushed. Simple common sense but yet never put it as the most important priority.…\", 'Great location, clean rooms and friendly and helpful staffs. Love my first experience! Will recommend this hotel to my friends and will certainly consider coming back for a weekend staycation. Thank You to all at Park Hotel, Clarke Quay.', 'Fantastic stay.

Hotel staff Gian offered early check in as well as late check out for us which we really appreciate the kind gesture. She also arranged for a high floor room with pool view. Thank you Gian!', \"We had such a wonderful experience. Room was small and cosy and perfect for just the 2 of us. We enjoyed the view of the street as well. The shower is small but we were fine with it, its just nice for 1 person. The concierge and all staff were very friendly and welcoming. If I could say 1 negative thing about the hotel is that they're not very soundproof. I think our neighbours had children so the kids were running around and making noise outside and we would hear everything. But it was a big problem for us we just dealt with it.

Waiting time and process was smooth. Breakfast was great with good choice of variety. Was specially satisfied with one of front desk a lady with long hair and specs. Regret not getting her name to comment of her good services. While checking out, as i was with two luggages and one small one for my child. Was impressed when this lady rush over to inform one of the staff to help us with the load.

We stayed in the Premier room, the room is good for the price. The bed is very comfortable. However, the bathroom floor can be quite slippery when wet.

I would come to regret this! As service was abysmal, i requested to shorten my stay but Hotel was not agreeable.  Check-in: \"Darren\" checked me in.

Now comes my unhappiness I have experience here at Orchard Hotel.  1st: Upon reaching the entrance of this hotel, We were greeted by this old malay bell man whom is so rude asking us to fill up the form b4 entering the hotel.  2nd: The pillow was flat even the comforter is higher. 3rd: The sofa bed makes a double bed half part of it keep on moving which is very irritating. It is hard too not comfortable to sleep on. 4th: Going in the swimming pool, the Indian pool attendant was using the hp while on duty I presume. when we came and ask us if we made a reservation n ask us if we screenshot the reservation, I have been to so many hotel in SG this the 1st time…', 'Orchard Hotel has always been our favourite hotel for staycations. We’ve also always recommended any family visiting Singapore to stay at Orchard, so we really take no pleasure in writing this review but hopefully it will help Orchard Hotel improve. On our last stay in November 2020, we noticed a slight decline in certain aspects of the hotel but needless to say, because of COVID-19 we kind of excused it away.   We initially booked two nights, then extended for the third night for our 9th year anniversary. We checked in at 4pm (check in’s are at 3pm) and was told that check out would be at 11am! (usually at 12pm) We think it’s just appalling that COVID-19 is used as an excuse to start short changing your customers.

Felt that if this was the case I shouldn't have been allowed to book an early check in slot.   Nonetheless, we decided to try our luck 1hr later and they had an available room. This room seemed a bit dated and had certain deficiencies like a broken door and work out wallpaper. Called engineering to have it rectified but after they came they were unable to solve the door issue and suggested we change room.   The second room had much better decor and seemed newer. Overall experience was good given the price. Both rooms were the same size but the newer one appeared bigger as the toilet was smaller. However if we had stayed in the first room throughout…\", \"Room is spacious. Aircon is not cold throughout the night. Was warm at times.  Was expecting alot of amenities for a clubroom, but disappointed.  Couldn't increase volume on TV, as neighbouring room could hear, but it was still soft for us.  Breakfast is good and filling. Lucky never opt for buffet.  Well, as a whole, a good-average stay.\", 'My family and I had a 3D2N stay with Orchard Hotel during the March holiday and we totally enjoyed ourselves to the fullest!  Greeted instantly by the friendly bell uncles once the lift from the carpark opened to the hotel entrance already caught us by surprise!   I would like to give my utmost commendation to Front office staffs Kelly, Zoey and Yen for making our whole  process of checking in and out of the hotel seamlessly. You guys are warm, professional and efficient! Much better than many 5 stars hotels service in Singapore we have experienced!

We appreciate all the services rendered to us and THANK all the staffs who…', 'I truly enjoyed my one night stay & i find it very relaxing. Since it was a off peak day, we had the whole pool to ourselves. Room was simple & classic where simplicity is at its best.  Pro: complimentary parking Con: late checkout latest at only 12 pm  But I wouldn’t mind booking this hotel again for my next stay. Thumbs up.', 'My return visit to Orchard Hotel for a retreat. An advice: to book it on weekdays to maximum the pool/gym facilities and lesser check-in queue. The first visit was full of crowds due to weekends.   The front office team (Quam and Kenta) were extremely accommodating and allowed us to have a late checkout. So this was a big plus, especially that I checked in late at 6pm. Thoughtful sanitizer mobile device at the front desk counters for guests too! Many thanks to Quam for his meticulous and humble hospitality service.  There were some hiccups, the minibar fridge wasn’t cold, an ice bucket for $5++, room bathroom can be renovated, eg bath tub too small and rundown, and dust in the toilet.  Nonetheless, would definitely send a friend there and return for the reasonable room rates,…', 'I was very impressed with the service accorded to my family and I when we stayed over at the hotel. Special mention to our bellman Santhanam for his fantastic service.

From my personal stay twice with the hotel, Grand Deluxe room is 22m2, NOT 28m2. Got cheated by the 28m2 room size to book their grand deluxe room. As seen from my images, the walking gap is only the size of a pillow.. The walking gap, be it toilet to the cupboard, both sides of the bed to the wall, all are only the size of a pillow. If you have two person walking, you would have to walk like a crab.  Stayed at Orchard hotel earlier on this year, spending $151 per night. Was allocated a corner room.

The front desk counter's service was impeccable; the staff were hospitable and warm. They left a very good first impression of our stay. The service among the hotel staff were good as well, be it the housekeeping, security or other staff.  We stayed in a Premier King Room. While not the newest, it was spacious enough to place a cot beside our King Size Bed.   The location of the hotel meant we were never far from the major shopping centres and eateries, so food and transport was never an issue despite us not driving.   Would greatly recommend Orchard Hotel for all families with young children.\", 'Greeted with warm smiles the moment you enter the hotel for check-in.

Their attention to detail as we made a mistake in our booking and effort to provide service beyond their duties is remarkable. The extra mile to explain the facilities  in the property and a little cake for a simple birthday made us really welcomed!  Not forgetting that even when masked up, they “smiled” with their eyes.

This year was much quieter, as lions dance and dragon dance were not allowed.  However, it was still a good stay.  Everything was so familiar, since we have already stayed here several times.  We were given a room overlooking the Orchard Road, and a full view of the swimming pool.  So it was a nice room with good view.  Room was spacious enough for an extra bed.  Although the room was not very big, it was cosy.  Breakfast was served at Orchard Cafe.

Equipped with a highly updated sound and lighting system, coupled with 2 huge LED screens, the ballroom is set to be a dream venue for any couple out there.

From day one of the ballroom viewing, to the food tasting and the wedding day itself and at checkout, Haze and Mun Kiat who were the sales and operations personnel attached to us, ensured that our every need is attended to.

My friend walked into the hotel with 2 toddlers, carrying a bag, large parcel and a cake, and although there were concierge staff standing around, I must conclude they must be visually challenged; as no one offered to assist.  The check-in process is designed to make guests feel as unwelcome as possible. Take a number to check-in like you would at an emergency room, wait around like idiots waiting to be called. Check in is slow and tedious, lacking in information unless we ask for it.  2 main guests and only up to 3 visitors. Only 2 guests can stay overnite: kind of like I’m a hospital.  Check in staff,Devi, refused to register our guests in during the check in process and just told us to proceed to the lifts with our keycards.

It’s where the city’s young and beautiful head after hours for classy cocktails, fine dining and gambling. Of course, plenty of tourists visit too, for the world-famous observation deck which affords stunning views of the Lion City.  My room at Marina Bay Sands was huge and modern, with incredible views of the bay and the Shoppes. The bed was huge and the bathroom had a huge standalone tub that I just couldn’t wait to get in after a day of exploring the hot and humid city!

I feel awful for the staff because they are wonderful, but their product is worse than any hotel I’ve ever been in.  1) Initial booking- I spent over an hour waiting for their email that would allow me to book our pool stay and our check in time. I called after 20 min saying I had no email even though I had a booking confirmation number. They told me to wait. Called after an hour, they finally rebooked because there was “a problem” with their booking system. Great.  2) They gave us an upgrade at check in from a grand club to their orchid suite (single step upgrade), probably because they could see I had 4 calls to…', 'Marina Bay Sands is a landmark. And somehow, it kind of just stops there.  The exterior is splendid, and upon stepping into the lobby, you are greeted by a sense of modern grandeur. From here on, the hotel experience would start to appear lacklustre as compared to its glamour.   Before I go on, do understand that I have very high expectations of this establishment because of its reputation and, of course, price tag.  Majority of staff are well-trained and polite most of the time, but none of them displayed the intuition or sincerity that is characteristic of exceptional hospitality.

Other hotels in-house operator team just does not execute this type of service with the same level of professionalism.   The housekeeping team too is very professional and very friendly.

Infinity pool slot is also booked easily and the crowd were spaced out well between 3 pools, but 1 hour is really too short but can’t be helped. Sky park entry is also included. Breakfast was not included but we had it at Rise.   Really had a great experience and this surprise staycation for my mom was a success. Short but sweet and hopefully next time.', \"I had a memorable stay at MBS from 17 - 19 Mar. Mr Ramesh who is the Front Office Manager assisted very kindly with all my requests.

Day 2 - saw a rusty nail at the same area, just staring right at us when we reach the pool. Same spot.  Again, hotel promise to ensure safety at pool area in the evening and again the next morning.  Day 3 - staircase at same spot chipped off. May not be easily indentifiable but still a safety issue.  Mbs infinity pool seem dangerous.

We booked two rooms - a Premier room and a deluxe room for our family, not knowing that the the different room type meant we will need to stay in different towers.

Worse is denied having rooms at the same floor. So whats the point of having a stayca when rooms were so far away. Explanation given were MBS rules for COVID Prevention. Do not understnad why total of 5 people allowed in 1 room but having room at the same floor not allowed.

I wrote in early to request for their help in planning for a surprise party and was amazed by their promptness in replying and in doing their best to accommodate to all my requests. I was impressed that the concierge staff even knows who I was and what I needed when I simply told him my name. He explained that all concierge staff had been briefed and they were supposed to remember such details.   Needless to say, the room was pristine clean, the best I have stayed in Singapore, and the view from the room was just breathtaking.     \", \"Staycation was great with beautiful harbour view.

The Infinity Pool wasn't available throughout our 2 nights' stay, but there were many other things to do and eat within the compound and outside it.  We stayed at Tower 3 this time, and there was a balcony where you could sit and eat, read or just chill and appreciate the view of the sea and Gardens by the Bay.  The bed and linen were extremely comfortable, and their service was very prompt and pleasant.  There are also many restaurants and shops to wander through.

I could only accommodate either 3 adults or 2 adults+2 children.

Clean towels wrapped for higher safety during the pandemic.   Perfectly working air-conditioning control and WiFi was better than expected. Room service was excellent both in terms of food quality and classy delivery.   Infinity pool experience was excellent, almost magical as advertised.

We got the room with noisy fridge(i thought was aircon) which makes me (a light sleeper person) not able to sleep on the first night. After i gave them a feedback, they straightly change the fridge to the new one without noise. I was almost gave up my second night to just go back home as there is no point to do staycation without good sleep. Thankfully after they changed the fridge, everything was OK.  They have strict number of guest come and go into the tower. They count it in front of the lift entrance. So bear in mind to give ample time as it can be quite a queue on busy hours. As far my staycation journey goes, this is the only hotel that does it.  The pool is limited to 1 hour and very hard to get slot. Make sure to book early.

Family with younger kids or babies will love it because you have ample size to park your gigantic stroller and large space to open your luggages.  However, they do not have brushing kit or brushing mug for kids if you forgot to bring one. Bathrobes and slippers provided a upon request.

The only thing a Chinese do not like is there is a big mirror facing the bed that we are sleeping and it is not a good sign.', 'Had a night at MBS. Price wise is definitely high even though it was reduced due to no travellers during COVID era.   However, service and quality of the hotel speaks for the price itself. Everything was top notch. From front desk to the security team to its room service. Will definitely return if i have extra money. The view at the infinity pool is definitely one you have to visit once in your lifetime. Even though MBS is 10 years old, amazingly it was well maintained.   All in all, such an amazing staycaytion. Trust me, one night isnt enough! Kudos to the staff for making my stay a memorable one. ', 'Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you must visit if you come to Singapore, like a checkbox in a to-do list. The rooms are clean and quite comfortable in 2010 style. TVs are from another age though. First of all, if you come by car, be aware that there is no direct access from the car park to the hotel. You will have to walk through the entire adjoining mall with your luggage. And the mall is huge. You can tell that your stay does not start off in the best possible way. The hotel also is awsomely big, Somehow, we have a bit of the impression of being in Las Vegas or even at the airport, especially at the time of check-in.

Another male receptionist was engaged on the phone and later left the counter, leaving the poor lady to manage all those in queue.  When I opened the door, was greeted by a view which is facing rooms of others. Nice decor are just on the outside, room is just average, with a bit back dated things in the room. Don't ever forget to bring along your phone charger plugs as they don't have USB ports, where you can just plug in the cords and charge the phone.  Nothing really fantastic about this hotel, which I don't really recommend to my contacts.\", 'Love this hotel location, I decided to move from a five star hotel to Dorsett. I had been stranded in SG since MCO and CB between JB/SG. Food, transportation to work and accommodation are my primary consideration. Thanks to the sales team (Dennis) to secure long term stay in Dorsett with a special rate. The room is clean and comfort with great service by their housekeeping team. The only suggestion to improve the APP for safe entry and input the daily repetition questions though you are registered guest.', \"This is a cheap and cheerful hotel, that's in a great area of Singapore.  It has an amazing bath in the Splash Room, which was a highlight. the swimming area is on teh basic side, but it is modern and good for exercise.   there's no F&B at all, But they allow deliveries from Grab or Deliveroo.\", 'Its the school holiday and also the birthday month of my firstborn so we spent 2nights in a splash room. Glad we booked early cos was told that the splash room was a fav. Now i know whyyy and id come back for it again.   Dorsett is located right smack in Chinatown. An area id never thought of staying for i thought it was jus out of the way from town but my stay there changed everything. Outram NEL is jus right below n it links with Outram EWL. Jus one stop away to Harbour front/vivo and walking distance to chinatown point and keong saik. Cafes, restaurants, Bars are all walking distance and its just so convenient. Now i see why Dorsett is a hotspot for tourists.  I too dont quite like the idea of a staycay and having to travel soo far for food or drinks cos i like to spend more time in the comfort of the already cosy room so this, is perfect!   Shoutout to two Dorsett’s gem for my  Booking was made easy by Ms Naurah who handles my queries online and offline swiftly while my checking in process was smooth thanks to Ms Kacey. Thank u to everyone too for making my son’s bday staycay a memorable one too!   For the situation the world now is facing, i feel safe here on this new norm for their process of screening incoming guests. So i assure u that no guests will be able to enter the hotel without declaring their health and travel info.   My stay at Dorsett are made even better with such clean and cosy rooms that made me miss my nights there while typing these.  Well equipped with toiletries, coffee, tea and bottled water. I like the idea of having the access to the wardrobe from the bathroom itself.  I mentioned we booked the splash room so we got the bathtub and a separate shower. Loved how we cud roll up the blind so that i cud sit on the bed even when my kid is playing in the tub unlike one hotel i hav to squeeze in the alrdy small bathroom with him. Not here .. the bathroom is spacious!  The king bed fits us nicely. Em Fluffy pillows n warm quilt. With that, i still hav a lil corner for the kiddo to play his toys. Not big but its really cosy.   There’s one thing though .. one thing that made my kiddo whines. I was spending a little too long in the shower. I cant help it. 😂 The rain shower pressure was soo good i swear tt was the best shower i had in hotels. Ya know .. usually the water pressure in hotels are a lil slow but this one was really good together with their refreshing mint scent of body shower and shampoo. That must be why i had a gd sleep aft too.   I still hav soo many things to write about but i have pictures that can help me do the deeds instead.   Tips: Lookout for their promo on their website and book early to avoid disappointment cos really, the splash room was hot!  Lastly, be nice be kind and be responsible 😘  Enjoy the pics and stay safe guys!   …', 'My wife and I had a good staycation for couple of days recently at Dorsett Hotel Singapore located at New Bridge Road. Wonderful location connected by MRT lines and SBS buses. It’s all a matter of 5 to10 mins walk from the hotel to the transport links to go to any part of Singapore.  The other big plus of the hotel is its location which is right smack in the middle of Chinatown. You have access to all the eateries like Food courts  located in Maxwell Hong Lim and not forgetting Chinatown Point. The hidden food treasures in Keong Saik Road, Bukit Pasoh,Smith street, mosque street and pagoda street are countless, if you need to fulfil your gastronomic needs.  The Dorsett hotel entrance and lobby is swanky and lovely it was quiet though but well served with good reception by front desk. They take the Covid measures professionally and with a polite and smiling  approach. They are helpful and at the same thoughtful.   Dennis who doubles as their manager and who deals with hotel guests was a great help in getting our reservations done even though we had to change our dates. He took the trouble to show us the lovely rooms and the amenities available in the hotel like the swimming pool and gym. He even made arrangements to get a cake for my wife’s birthday, it was indeed a special touch. On our date of arrival he received us and assisted in bringing our bags from our car.   With regards to the room it’s a lovely property spacious enough for two and well laid out wardrobes and well demarcated shower and toilet area.  The housekeeping staff did a great job during our stay and they were always on hand to tend to our needs. I must say the room that we we stayed was super clean and their linen were of good quality.

We felt cared for when we needed directions and were offered help to call a taxi as well as confirm the cost. Every morning of our stay, Jackie greeted us and genuinely seemed interested in our day's events as she wished us a good breakfast. The first morning we took her recommendation to try the specialty coconut-filled French toast. Jason helped by offering suggestions for activities to fill one of our evenings. We followed his directions and had a great time on the River Walk.  The Dorsett's location is ideal to get around Singapore so easily  - I highly recommend the hotel and staff!\", 'We came back for the second time. Service is still good but facilities itself needs to be maintained. The room looks a bit old, even we upgraded. Most important is the toilet was very clean. Thanks to all housekeeping staffs.', 'Really wanna compliment Yadi and his team when I was checking in this afternoon. Extremely swift and fast with the process. Me and my partner are very impressed with the customer service that theg provided! Kudos to you guys! Highly recommend this place too for the convenience!! 1 min away from mrt station!!', 'Excellent Location just few step from MRT Outram Park station. Nice room decoration. Really appriciate with hotel manager, Yadi, and his staff, Jenny, for a warm welcome in Singapore. Especially, a surprise complementary gift from hotel!! :)', 'I was particularly pleased with the prompt, competent and courteous assistance I got from staff persons Yadi and Oonah.  Steps from Chinatown with its great shopping and food, and the a metro station right there.', 'Hospitable upon arrival, however unhelpful upon departure.  Reception staff do not communicate and renege on commitments made by other staff regarding left luggage.  Price reasonable, but many better options in Singapore.', 'A great hotel, with a privileged location, Chinatown is within a walking distance. I stayed there during the celebrations of the Chinese New Year, which made the whole Chinatown beautifully decorated. To my surprise, the hotel kindly invited the guests to join the Lion Dance, a once in a year event, led by the General Manager, with the participation of executives and hotel staff. It was totally unexpected, which made this experience unforgettable.', 'We stayed here last year and returned again this year. We booked the smaller room this year as we only stayed two nights. We would advise paying a little extra for the bigger room if you stay more than two nights as the smaller room could become a little claustrophobic. In the smaller room one side of the bed has no side table. THE BED IS SUPER COMFY AND MASSIVE! Best thing about the room. Bedding is sumptuous.  Walk in shower is hot and powerful. Room has tea and coffee facilities. International plug sockets for all plugs so no adaptors required. Large in room safe. Robes provided. Good selection of essential toiletries in bathroom. Staff are so helpful and professional. The hotel is next door to a train station so location is great. Chinatown is around a 10 minute walk max…', 'This a beautifully decorated and presented hotel.  The welcome was friendly and helpful from the moment our taxi pulled in.  Our room was very comfortable. Bathroom area was a bit small but we managed.  The restaurant has a great selection of meals and at a good price.  It is situated on the Outram MRT line so you can go anywhere.  It’s also a close walk to the Chinese Markets and around the corner from bakery’s, restaurants and bars.  We walked down New Bridge Road to the river, which isn’t as far as we thought. Perfect situation to walk or get transport to all the tourist areas as well.  Floor 3 has a nice swimming pool which overlooks the street but is quiet and relaxing. Also a gymnasium.  Would definitely stay here again.

On the second day before went out in the morning, I noticed that one of my earring back which put nearby the wash basin at night was disappeared. I spent a long time searching for it and very worried since it's my most favourite one. Finally, still couldn't. I'm sure that nobody came into my room before that. I told the officers at the front desk, let them take photo of the remaining earrings, and asked them to recheck for me before leaving. In the evening, Mr. Oonah Taylor together with security officer (s) were the ones who could find and returned it to me in original condition. I didn't see her on check-out date; anyway, would like to thank her and the team very much for the adorable patience, great kindness, and impressive service…\", 'It’s a beautiful hotel, and the service is perfect. Here’s a special thank to Mrs Guan & Mr Suntar, for they helped us a lot to enjoy this trip. 酒店距离牛车水很近，步行数分钟可到，到处都是中华美食；附近有一条街道上还有很多精致的酒吧，充满异域风情。从酒店出发去金融中心、金沙、鱼尾狮公园也很近，可以说是四通八达了。 客房服务很贴心，房间干净整洁，不过酒店楼层不是很高，这可能是比较遗憾的地方。总而言之是一场很棒的体验！', 'Recently stayed here for work for the first time based on the 4 star reviews on TripAdvisor. Never again. This is not a 4 star hotel, at best a poorly maintained 3 star hotel and overpriced. Pay $20 more and stay at the Swisotel Merchant Court which is a totally different experience. Basically: - Rooms very old, unclean and run down - Scratch and dirt marks everywhere, closet was falling apart, no bath, the shower was leaking, luckily I only went back to the hotel to sleep at night as I could not even work at the desk in the room which had no amenities whatsoever and was dark and cramped - There is only 1 place to eat on the ground floor and it was terrible. Do NOT pay for the breakfast, the food is not edible and shocking - basics that are very hard to get wrong like bread and…', \"I would like to compliment Yadi and Jenny for an amazing service rendered. Glad to have been attended by them. They made sure I had a great stay at Dorsett as it was my Hubby's bdae! It was indeed a good one. Well done guys!\", 'We had to book two rooms for our family of 5 which was a but of a downer but nevertheless the hotel helped us check in early thanks to Yadi at the front desk. Since we arrived in the morning after a flight where we couldnt sleep much, checking in early was a real blessing.  Yadi also managed to get us two tooms on the same floor which was helpful. There is a restaurant on site. But we get the feeling that the staff are overworked. We saw one of the waiters on duty from the morning and he appeared to have been working right through the day to when we went for dinner after 9 pm. If so, I just hope such long shifts are not mandatory.  The hotel in itself is ideally located for China town and was just a 12 dollar grab away from Sentosa in the morning.', 'Overall an ok hotel in a good location.  The good: Location Quiet generally  Comfortable bed and pillows Room is nice and dark  The bad: No coffee in room and no room service until the little restaurant opens Breakfast I probably the worst I have had in a hotel and don’t even start me on the coffee Walls are paper thin could hear the tv and talking from next door The towels oh Dorsett the towels they are thin and bare and falling apart. A simple refresh would make all the difference.  Overall not bad but would probably not stay again....', 'I stayed at Dorsett on my 2 day stop over in Singapore and found the hotel to be fantastic in cleanliness and excellent service by all staff that I met. Yadi was so so welcoming and funny to chat to. I will certainly stay at Dorsett again as the location is perfect for easy access to seeing the main attractions in the city being directly below the Outram Park MRT station. Highly recommended!', \"We got our room upgraded on our recent stay in Dorsett. We are grateful to be granted early check-in after a day of flight. Great location and a lift away from the nearest MRT station, which pretty much gets you everywhere in Singapore. Reception staff were friendly too. Hotel room is clean and better than expected. However, the hotel restaurant is a total no-no. Food quality is poor for a hotel standard and workers are rude and extremely unhelpful. We went for lunch buffet and food are not refilled, so we were literally scraping off the leftovers. Also, room service ends at 10pm, which doesn't serve the purpose as guests would probably need it most at wee hours. We had to order grab food instead.\", 'everyone was really lovely at Dorsett, especially Yadi. He’s been great help and has a fantastic humour. Thanks Yadi!  The hotel is located in a strategic location with fantastic bars and places nearby.   The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable.  The only downside is the hotel breakfast which I find frankly, quite embarrassing for a 4 star hotel. I don’t expect processed cheeses and such a small selection of breakfast.', 'Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband while exploring the city. This hotel is no way a 4 star. The reception looks like it is while the rooms tell a very different story. They are old and dated with a musty smell. More like a cheap 3 star. Also had a bad experience with a dirty towel being left in our room with a dirty plaster on it. When we went down to tell reception and ask them for new towels they didn’t seem bothered at all and got no apology. When we returned we had new towels but they hadn’t taken the dirty ones away. Customer service at reception wasn’t great. There was a lovely lady who served the breakfast who was very friendly and always offered advice on things to do and see. Have to say the only plus for this hotel is the location but we wouldn’t stay again.', 'Fantastic location if you want to enjoy Singapore. Walking distance to the Chinatown or 1 train stop away! The old house around the hotel has been recently refurbished into a boutique hotels, quirky bars, boutique brewery and elegant restaurants. Hotel itself is quirky and modern. Room was clean but the lay out is not really my style. Staff are friendly and helpful. overall very good hotel to stay.', 'this hotel is rundown and dirty, the room has marks and scratches all over the furniture. The shower had little insects walking around and the towels had frays all over them. Upon checkout we sat in the lobby for a while until the heat was unbearable, I asked the hotel staff if they could change the aircon seatings, they just said no...', 'Overall a nice stay with just nice and cozy room.  Most things are clean... just few parts can see the wear and tear started to take place... but its ok... things are good here.  Manage to get the free drink session (lounge access)... but there is no snack provided.. just wine and instant coffee... not even a coffee machine.. so.. to save some money.. this can be skipped.  Staff are great and friendly.  Very near to MRT.... convenient !', 'The Dorset is a very nice hotel with good-sized rooms convenient to Chinatown and the MRT – and very quiet despite the near-constant flow of traffic on New Bridge Road. There is a small pool off an upper floor. The breakfast offered a good variety of both Asian and Western food.', 'One of the smaller sized hotels we have stayed but has all the required amenities. A nice pool, sun bath chair, gym, but no self laundry. It is very near the MRT and bus station, less than a minute away. We were a group of friends who visited  Singapore after many years. We were accommodated by 2 lovely ladies Dana & Michelle and got our rooms on the same floor. The bell hop were also helpful for giving maps and assisting for calling taxi. Overall, good value and would stay again if we want to stay in town.', \"The OUTRAM MRT is just a stone's throw away - this is a plus point.  Room + Service is clean and comfortable.  It is great to have a pool that is surrounded with greens.   Parking is SGD$8 per exit. For every time you exit, you need to purchase an exit-coupon at the counter. So, do take note.   I think this is a good hotel to stay - especially when you are new to Singapore. Best F&B is all around you. Cafes, pubs and bars, too.\", 'I stayed for two nights on business. I requested an early arrival as I needed to attend a meeting and my longhaul flight arrived at 9:45am.  They got everything ready for me at check in and after a quick check inn I was up and running in no time. The room was the right size, very comfortable bed and has also a nice cascade shower. Amenities in the room were nice and wifi was at good speed suited for working on a presentation and to finish emails. The breakfast was reasonable, it was buffette style and had fruits, juices, some local options and other comon things to meet most tastes.  Best thing (appart from very good service) was location, just right on the metro, which is very convenient and efficient. You are also right on the Chinatown and there are many restaurants nearby.…', 'Friendly staff \"Jason\" that fast responding for my needs, that my room access can\\'t turn on the lights.

The bathrooms are quite narrow though. 8.5/10 for room cleanliness. 10/10 in terms location, Outram MRT is literally a stone's throw away and very close to USS, Orchard Road and even Marina Bay Sands. Yadi, the duty manager was very courteous and went the extra mile to make sure all our needs were addressed. Will stay here again.\", 'I went to Dorsett Singapore to view some rooms for my family who were visiting Singapore in December. I was greeted by Mr.Yadi, the manager of the hotel. Although I was just there for viewing and had not booked any rooms, he patiently answered all my queries and doubts, and gave me a small tour of the hotel and briefed me on the facilities. The entire time he was friendly, welcoming, and cracked some jokes! The staff are friendly, especially the manager. Would recommend this hotel!', 'We have returned to this hotel to stay for a few days. The location is near to the hospital, Outram Park station, and Chinatown. Everything is within reach.

We couldn't have found those restaurants without their help.\", 'They have the warmest & caring people. Special thanks to Michelle and Jackie for making our stay a memorable one ☺️ The food over at Amuse was really really great and the staff were always caring for  our needs ☺️', 'A 4* hotel with a 6*+ greatest location just above the subway station (one could take the subway all the way from the airport to the hotel at the cost of S$2.60 per ride), with ample great fine dining and more casual restaurants in the nearby very safe area (with the police headquarter right next door) within walking distance (ranging from one minute to 20 minutes), although the hotel itself is not quite 4* (at most 3.5* and more like 3*) in terms of ambiance.  The shower area in a very small and crowded washroom needs an upgrade, the cleanliness of which definitely has room for improvement (black mouldy marks between the tiles in the shower and the metallic door hinges were rusty already)', \"Stayed here for 5 nights on our recent stay in Singapore. Location was handy at Outram MRT Station. Chinatown was an easy 7 minute walk away. Lots of markets, places to eat and another MRT Station. The hotel had a lovely outdoor pool. We didn't try the restaurant so can't comment there. Check in and check out was friendly and quick. The room was clean and lovely. Taxi from airport was about S$25. Would stay here again if I go back to Singapore.\", 'The hotel is strategically located near Chinatown. Outram Park is next to it (5 min walk) and Chinatown is about 8 mins walk away. There is also a bus stop nearby. It is clean, and has basic amenities.  I will stay here again.', 'Stayed at the Dorsett while relocating from Australia to Singapore.  The upgrade to a bigger room was appreciated with our extra luggage.  Staff were exceptional; from our arrival when 2 concierge appeared to help with luggage, easy and swift check in with Siri, the very friendly and helpful lady running breakfast to the fantastic person I met in the elevator who filled up our water bottles.  We will definitely recommend to friends & family visiting based on service, room size and facilities. ', \"I've stayed many times in Singapore and for the price you pay, this hotel is great value. Upon checking in, Yadi, the hotel manager (if I remember correctly) was extremely pleasant and helpful, going above and beyond what I would normally expect. I was very impressed with early check-in and him providing an umbrella because I was rushing to a meeting while it was raining heavily. The staff was the highlight of my stay.\", \"Overall, good.  Will return.  Booked in girlfriend's name. Room standard and ok.  Could improve on bathroom area cleanliness (house keeping supervisor - please note). Slept fine.  In room TV and electrics all fine.  Location good - next to subway and 15-20 min walk from Marina Bay (3 or 4 stops on MRT). Staff professional and polite - as would expect in Sing.  Night time staff could improve attentiveness/dress a bit. Restaurant on ground floor - on small side and average looking, but food was very good, and staff inside friendly (even in the face of one rather rude guest).

The hotel is very cozy and staff are very warm and helpful.  Special mention to Yadi and the reception staff who are always welcoming.', 'This was my first visit to Singapore and I chose the Dorsett Hotel based on its location and positive reviews.  I was checked in by Jason at the front desk. His service was excellent. He up graded my room and provided useful information about the surrounding area (MRT location, etc.).  My room was very nice.  A minor issue was a lack of conveniently placed electrical outlets.  The breakfast buffet was good, offering a fine variety.  The hostess, Jackie, was so very friendly and helpful.  If I return to Singapore, I would not hesitate to stay at the Dorsett.  It has a great, convenient location, nice rooms and outstanding service.', 'We were pleasantly surprised by the spacious and clean the room is given that they been ard a few years and how complete their amenities are, comb, bathtub etc. The area is interesting with a lot of variety of foods.

I don't use hotel every time I travel, but actually satisfied with Dorsett. With cozy sofas at some places there, i enjoyed them, and if you are everyday-excerciser, this hotel is well recommended as it have clean swimming pool and fitness place. The room was great, and thought that was enough, or more better than I expect to the hotels I will stay. Lobby was so not that big, but it is a kind of place seems luxurious. This hotel have great location. Almost at the place the hotel is, you can get subway at Outram Station, or Singapore Chinatown is not that far from the hotel.

Facilities I can’t really comment on as I didn’t use them, the bar/restaurant looked fairly small. Staff were friendly and there was a lovely Belgium Microbrewery bar opposite which was a pleasant surprise. The room itself was very small and felt dated and cramped. I especially didn’t enjoy seeing the staining on the cream carpet, which gave the room an overall feel h of being dirty.

Room was small but clean and well-appointed. Staff service throughout the hotel was excellent. Included breakfast was tasty and catered to both Asian and Western tastes. A few small quibbles: room design is poor in several ways. No outlet for the hair dryer in the bathroom so have to sit on the bed and use a mirror kind of far away. Shower door skims the floor so tightly that it bunches up the bathmat and you have to step out onto a bare floor, which could be slippery and dangerous. Also, every day at least one of my towels was threadbare or had a hole in it. That being said, I would definitely return to the Dorsett due to location adn friendly staff.', 'The hotel staff were thoughtful enough to upgrade my room and prepare a cake for my hubby’s birthday.

It is in the Chinatown area, right on top of a subway station, where I enjoyed the night life of Chinatown and the convenient of access practically everywhere by MRT. I stayed only one night this trip to embark a cruise at Harbor Front and the location is just right. Very well-managed chain (from Hong Kong) and the room allocated to me is spacious and has excellent city view. It has all facilities including a mobile phone for local use. Service is very good. My previous stays in Singapore have been in 5-stars at Orchid Rd or Marina Bay but this change is a revelation, as Chinatown may be an even more interesting areas to explore (a 5-min walk).One of the best among 4-stars, and good value makes it nearly 5-star.', 'We really enjoyed our stay here.

Dorsett never let down our expectations. Though the usual check in time is 2pm if you're lucky you may get early check in, like me. Thanks to the crew for giving room at 9am itself. Total relief. Couldn't get this in the previous visit though. Rooms are decent enough for staying with all the regular amenities provided like toilitries, pool and gym. I would say the breakfast is average rather good. May be because of less vegetarian/indian options for me. Singapore is not aplve where we stay inside the rooms and all we need is a comfortable sound sleep at the end of exhaustive walk or trips/visits of city.

All in all, uncomfortable, disappointing, not worth the momey.', 'The Dorsett Singapore fell well short of my expectations. Firstly, the ceiling of my room was severely mouldy - see attached photo, which for me it unacceptable for a 4 star hotel. The lobby I also found uncomfortably hot, almost like they do not have the air conditioning running, and I live in Dubai so am used to hot and humid conditions. The double single bed room was small and tight with very little space to move around. On the plus sides, the beds are comfortable, and the location is on the edge of Chinatown, meaning that you have more eating and drinking options on your doorstep than you could wish for.

There were 2 bottles of water each day which are needed as Singapore is HOT! Awesome shower that also had the rain shower head in the ceiling. There was a snack /drink vending machine in the lobby.

It is convenient to go by MRT, there is the way to go down to the station next to hotel. Breakfast is good but the man work there is unfriendly. It seem like customers beg him for food.

The staff are really friendly but the rooms themselves are poorly designed and not comfortable - the bathroom is a very odd design and the so called double bed was two uncomfortable single beds put together. Not worth the money. Warning: we booked through booking.com and the advertised price does not include tax...', \"The only great things about this hotel is the location. Other than that, breakfast is mediacore, service is bad.  Asked for housekeeping in the evening as the do not disturb sign was up during the day. Called reception from the room 3 times, there was no answer. Called operator and housekeeping, no answer either. Why bother having a speed dial form the room phone if nobody is going to answer the phone?  Went to request housekeeping at the front desk. Came back to a room still unkempt, but with a bunch of towels left on the table. Is that the Dorsett Singapore version of housekeeping? If you're looking for easily accessible location and around the same price, can easily find other with great location but with better service.\", 'We stayed at Dorsett Hotel for 4 nights and it was superb! The hospitality of their staff especially Front Office agents is remarkable! From check-in to check-out, it was really smooth and hassle free.. their FO Manager Ms. Michelle was very friendly and accommodating!

Walking distance to Chinatown where you can eat and shop esp if you’re in a budget.  Overall, our stay was enjoyable and satisfying :)', \"I really enjoy staying at the Dorsett. Have stayed 3 times now and it has been better each time. The staff are excellent, with requests handled enthusiastically. The pool is a lovely size, and beautifully clean. Room service menu is comprehensive and well priced. My only criticism would be that the lighting in the bathroom is not great, so for ladies getting ready for a function, its a bit of an inconvenience.

It was my second time staying at the property (the first was many years ago) but the first time post COVID-19.   We were granted early check-in and it was done efficiently. Service was friendly and we were upgraded to the Club Floor at the Orchard Wing. View from the room the was nice, the room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable.   I believe the hotel does need refreshing and refurbishing as the decor is rather dated. I’m not sure if there are newly renovated rooms though. The one we stayed in is definitely not one of them.

In general, the experience has been wonderful. Great value for money. I stayed in a Club Room each time and enjoyed breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. The food was delicious and sufficient quality for the price point. There is not much alcoholic beverages to select from during evening cocktails but was still ok.

I felt that the process of checking in could be faster if they allowed guests to fill in the forms online while waiting in the queue. Perhaps if you are flexible in your timing, I highly recommend to check-in 1-3 hours later instead. Other than that, the room was splendid and the service staff was very helpful. They tried to accommodate us as much as possible by granting us a late checkout of 1 hour and helping us to store our luggage even after we checked out from a 1-night stay.', 'My family truly enjoyed our one night stay.We wished it could have been longer.We loved the hotel ambience and decor.I hate hotels that no matter how clean they look but the musky,dusty smell still lingers.But I was completely pleased with our room located of the 23rd floor (which we were thankfully granted - high floor as requested).No weird smells,nothing!And whatever features there are,were all in great working condition!The location is definitely a plus as well.Overall,my family completely enjoyed our stay.Would definitely come back after this whole covid situation settles.Otherwise,all compliments from us!Special thanks to Leow Lee San and John for their wonderful service!', 'Service of the hotel staff  is commendable.

Perfect for a short getaway.', 'Hotel & room itself was lovely with great service during checkin. We even got a free upgrade to a club room. Room was immaculate although the fixtures etc were starting to show their age. Our main gripe was the extremely disappointing food at Chatterbox. The food was really mediocre despite the sky high prices. We ate there for dinner & breakfast using our vouchers. if we had to pay actual prices for the food, it is totally not worth it. Given the sky high prices, we had huge expectations of the food. $30 for a plate of ok nasi goreng or a bowl of terrible wanton noodles is just ridiculous. Even the world famous chicken rice that came with hainanese pork chop was soggy & not fragrant.Xx', 'My family had a wonderful experience during our stay there! The check in was attended by Hailee who check us in quickly and accomodated to all our requests.

At first, when checking in, can't really hear what the girl is talking about, too fast and too soft, she did not tell us much. Fortunately the stay is a pleasant one.\", \"Mandarin Orchard provided an excellent service that's beyond expectations :) The receptionist was very polite and kind. We were pleasantly surprised when she offered us late check out until 1pm because we arrived at the hotel very very late (around 11.30pm) as we decided to do all our activities first before checking in. Then, we had some trouble trying to access the lift with our hotel card but was assisted by a very humble man at the concierge. Then, when we entered the hotel room, there was a nice chocolate cake on the table as it was our wedding anniversary. I would like to thank all your staff for the service provided.

Hotel is located right in the heart of Orchard Rd, with plenty to do for young and old. Two MRT stations close by which makes it convenient if you want to use the MRT or Grab. I booked 2 x deluxe rooms for 4 days.  I gave the room a 3 star as there was no power sockets at the bed side tables. This means we had to use the spare gpo at the work desk and also unplug the lamp sitting on the work desk. Also, where the kettle is positioned, the cable length of the kettle doesn't reach the gpo provided near the floor. We had to move the kettle to the work desk and use the gpo there. Suggest the hotel provides a power board to charge electronic devices.   Apart from the gpo, the room was perfect :-)\", 'Went there to celebrate for husband and son bday!

This is our 3rd staycation in Singapore. We previously stayed in Sofitel Sentosa & Grand Hyatt, but Mandarin Orchard is by far our favorite!  I would like to personally thank Syaza who made our stay very memorable. Given the COVID situation, you will need to pre-book hotel facilities (this is the same for all hotels). Syaza was very attentive and offered to book pool & gym slots for us. Being a very active couple we were really happy about this!

Tons of shopping and eating places around.  Booked an Executive Suite on the 32nd floor for two nights. The main hotel check-in area on the 5th storey was very crowded, but thankfully we were able to check-in on the 38th floor, which was emptier and much nicer. We had access to the Meritus Lounge on the 39th floor, which offered complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea/buffet and cocktails (which offered light food as well).

However, I was disappointed and would not return again. Here's why: 1. Prearrival - received email 5 days in advance to fill out a form. Filled out the form and responded to the email to inquire hi-tea and cocktail timing as I will be celebrating my friend's birthday and need to do some planning. Was forwarded to the straits club mgr to answer the hi-tea and cocktail timing, only.  2. Arrival - ID with date of birth was given upon check in but also no recognition.  3. Room is old, facing the insides of the hotel with minimum amenities. Understand it's COVID and you trying to go green but not sure if that is luxury - when you need the guest to call and request for basic amenities (e.g. Comb, cotton bud, etc.) Later on when we asked for the cotton buds, then we realised that it comes with the vanity kit (with cotton pad and nail file) which means, the vanity kit in the room when we checked-in (missing cotton buds) are left from the previous guest? 4.  Food served at hi-tea and cocktail was meh. Not worth going for seconds.  5. Chandon breakfast - Again, not recognised or asked if we would like Chandon. Only when asked and after checking, then was there Chandon served. Saving grace was that the breakfast spread is actually tasty but not enough to get me back again. We don't expect complimentary gifts or cake but guest recognition is clearly non-existent in Fullerton.…\", 'Staycation time. Excellent checkin/front desk staff. Great room with Marina Bay view. Bed and sheets great to sleep and recharge. Toilet is TOTO with bidet! Great shower/bath facility.   Cable TV is choppy and needs to be improved on.

The view from the swimming pool is specular with the colonial style building as the backdrop and the view of the Singapore River.', 'We held our wedding at Fullerton and were blown away by the stellar service of Benedict Anthony Salvaraj (aka Ben) and his team. We could not have asked for a more perfect banquet manager. He was proactive, accommodating, polite and never failed to anticipate our every need. For example, when the bride made a passing comment about her hands being dirty, he immediately whipped out hand sanitiser within seconds to assist. Ben led his team effectively and was able to ensure that everything was executed according to plan even though we made multiple last minute changes.   Not only did Ben perform his role exceptionally, he was also a very reassuring and calming presence during the whole event and especially before our march-ins. He truly went above and beyond and is really an asset to Fullerton. We would highly recommend Fullerton and Ben, for their outstanding service which more than exceeded our expectations.   Thank you, Ben, for making our experience such a perfect one. We really appreciate your help and professionalism!…', 'The Fullerton Hotel and its rich architecture , history and heritage made our weekend staycation very special and pampered , where we was cosseted in luxury and hospitality, at every turn and corner ; be it in the hotel rooms , the dining areas and the external surroundings; in its classy ambience and stellar service.   Most notable is the hotel’s very well trained, professional service staff ( from front desk , reception , Town restaurant , chambermaids ) who also exuded sincere willingness to help and answer our every requests ; tactfully offering helpful suggestions whenever we were at a loss or appeared confounded at our choices , confused at directions or even mode of ordering in the restaurants.  Most commendable : Mr Lalikumar ( v accommodating and with a charming sense of humour ) , Mei , Wendy and staff who waited upon us on 17/4/21 dinner and breakfast 18/4/21 7:30-8:30 ( so sorry I didn’t get everyone’s names ).

The Fullerton is the only hotel which didn't send a pre-arrival email to book slots for pool, breakfast, checkin, restaurants, etc.  2. Checkin was a mess, we needed to wait about 30-40 minutes, everything was very slow.  3. The checkin staff insisted that we can book slots for pool, gym, etc by calling them from room, he didn't really want to assist and he tried to expedite.

This package was recommended to us by AMEX Platinum travel service which includes a high-tea, evening cocktails and Chandon breakfast.  Initial check-in impression and the room are all fine, no major issues. The real issue with us is around the high-tea and evening cocktail. The key issue and source of our disappointment is around the clarity of the service level/offering and the attitude of one particular service staff.

We will definitely recommend Fullerton Hotel to our friends.  Thanks again and hope we can comeback again soon!', 'I first was in this building to pick up mail while backpacking in 1997. After seeing how beautifully it was converted into a hotel, I’ve since had the Fullerton on my bucket list of places to stay. However, having now lived here for 15 years, it took Covid travel restrictions to inspire the ‘staycation’.   Wow- it did not disappoint! I had an absolutely lovely experience; from the comfortable, well-appointed rooms, to the beautiful view of the Marina, and to the excellent food and eating spaces. To top it off, the staff and servers were attentive and warm. I highly recommend the Fullerton for a memorable Singapore experience.', \"It costs quite a bit to stay here, but when you consider the attention to detail and the quality of service, it's totally worth it.

Very suitable for young couples for a staycation. There was short queue upon my arrival, however the front desk staff were pretty efficient in clearing the queue given that it was a weekend when i checked in. I got checked in within 20min. Room size was towards the small side, but it had a warm and cosy feel. However, the pillows were a little flat, and I had stack two pillows on top of each other to sleep comfortably!

Booked for the good room queen. Unique design and very comfortable. Most importantly, the hotel staff were excellent. They were very willing to help and looked happy to serve.

Room was complete with hair dryer and boxes of water 👍🏼 Handled by Bobby and Hana and we were very happy with the attentiveness they provided. Thank you!', \"Don't look further, Hotel G is the one of the best hotels to use your SRV vouchers!  1. The most basic package is $100 - you don't need to fork out cash to top up. I.e. You can spend your cash on good food.   2. The rooms are small but the service is great.  The rooms are small, about 15-17 sqm, but I don't feel suffocated. The same can't be said for bigger rooms I stayed in other hotels in SG and overseas. The rooms are nicely and uniquely designed, unlike many business hotels with generic rooms. The mattress they use is serta, so it's very nice to sleep on. Though the pillow can be a tad tough and flat. Also, the air con's temperature and wind speed are adjustable, hooray!

I booked thru its hotel official website ,and get email with attractive offers. I was surprised to see that biggest room was offered to me at the price of $90 . This room was not included in the list of room available for booking for the day.  However, I decided to skip all the F&B offers , like Burger in Bed,  and other tempting snacks like \" chicken wings, ice cream tubes\\' because I need to watch my diet.  On the day of check in, check in was effortless and no complimentary check out was offered.  Went to 8 storey and check in single room.  Again, Hotel G is good at applying common sense in maximising the space of work desk.  kettle, cup, and container of coffee/ tea was placed on the wall holder. Very good! it create bigger place…', 'Using SRV to redeem a good deal at Hotel G, check in was fast and smooth. Surprised with room decor upon entering. Little small touches from the hotel that make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Room is small but cosy and clean. Deal comes with $50 Ginette restaurant which is worth. Thanks to Howard and Bobby who made our stay enjoyable. Highly recommended.', \"Initially booked the Good Queen room for a 3D2N stay with my partner for our anniversary celebration. But after the 3D2N, we love the location of the hotel and the amenities, and then we decided to extend our stay for an additional night. Upon that extension, Daryl actually gave us a complimentary upgrade to the Great King room. Both my partner and I were shocked but happy at the same time.  I strongly recommend Hotel G as its location is very convenient to almost everywhere. It's food is commendable as well. Last but not least, their staff are very friendly and approachable which includes both Daryl and Bella.\", 'Booked the good queen room for 2 night stay through Traveloka, check in timing was allocated to us via email (4pm-5pm). We had to queue for 15-20 mins to check in as it was a public holiday. However, the process was fast and fuss free.  The room was small yet cosy and clean! Bed was really soft too. Location of the hotel was near to multiple MRT stations, nearest 24/7 convenient store is located only at bugis+ even though there was multiple 7-11 across the street that only open till night.

They would strike up conversations about our stay and how they could improve better, once the feedback was given, immediate action was taken to ensure that we had a pleasant stay at our room.   However, the bathroom lights were tripping most of the time and even after servicing the lights, it still went out the next day.', \"Did a staycaytion using the rediscover voucher and it was very worth it!!

Bobby at reception was so helpful and patience to assist our questions and enquires.  The room interior design are cosy makes us feel comfortable even the room size is a bit small.

Very friendly and caring staff; second time here and not disappointed one bit! Big shout out to Daryl, Shawn and Bobby! Awesome service guys!', 'Tbh I don’t find the room too small as I’ve stayed in smaller. It’s OK for SG standards, where space is priced at a premium. The room is cleverly designed to maximize space while allowing you to feel cozy without feeling too claustrophobic. There’s space under the bed for luggage, and enough room for a small table for working travellers. Rooms feel quite well-maintained. Checkin and out was fast and efficient. And there’s so many food options in the area. Would stay at again!  ', 'I am not so fussy when commenting. I like G hotel overall. Good customer service during check-in and the receptionist is good and helpful. Very comfortable and clean hotel.   Thank you!  Thank you!

However, the experience this time was not so enjoyable. The plusses were that the front staff were courteous and professional during check in, the hotel itself was quiet with strong wifi for working, and the breakfast was very filling and delicious. However, not all the perks listed on the package were given, such as the morning and midday snacks. The fresh juices were nice, though.

A secret tip - there's a game at the lift where if you spot the differences, you get a free wine from the bar downstairs ;) I would definitely come back to stay again with Hotel G! \", 'Second time staying here, always very intrigued by the giant dream catcher in the room. However, the dream catcher in my room this time was a bit uglier and plainer than the first (the first had feathers).   Room wise, it’s an affordable stay hence room size is small. It’s still manageable even though the bed is fitted tightly at the corner which means one of the guests would have a hard time going to the toilet in the middle of the night.  Service wise, we had a warm welcome by manager Darryl, a much kinder greeting than our first stay. He allowed us early check in, likely since it was a Friday so there might have more available rooms.

Unlike my other staycations here in Singapore, i do not have to deal with issues on cleanliness, service and thoughtfulness of the staff. Being particular about cleanliness, i always do a check on hotel room’s cleanliness by wiping down surfaces with strong disinfectant wipes. Of the multiple visits here in Hotel G, i found my wet wipes remain unstained. Kudos for the consistency.   Good Crowd management, customer service experience and thoughtfulness of the staff can be felt from the entrance to the concierge; even along the corridor when i bump into the staffs.

Good job in designing', 'We had a wonderful stay with Hotel G.   Special mention to front desk managers Daryl and Bella. Praiseworthy services from both of them and the rest of the hotel staffs.  Dinning at in-house restuarant Ginett was excellent as well.  We will be back.', 'Daryl & Bella who attended us during check in and check out is so friendly, make us feels so good celebrating our 5 years anniversary. The voucher we got we purchase the desserts menu from Ginett Restaurant and my godness is so delicious!! Will come back for the hospitality and excellent dessert! Thank you!', \"The room is so compact, it's a tight squeeze for 2 adults. You have to literally climb onto the bed to plonk yourself into the other side. The wash basin is just outside the shower and toilet. There's no wardrobe, just an open hanger with 4 hangers to hang your clothes. A kettle with complimentary coffee/tea bags on a tiny desktop leaves no space to place your personal accessories like phones, jewellery, etc.  Breakfast is the standard western fare or chicken congee, with a cup of cut fruits and croissants. Service is efficient, though you have to ask for butter if you want it with your croissants.  Hotel G is a conveniently located near to MRT stations Rochor/Bencoolen. It's just opposite Fortune Centre and Sunshine Plaza, so food options are aplenty.   \", \"My first time staying in Hotel G and it was amazing! its an affordable hotel and the service was beyond expectation. Even though the room was small, it felt very cosy due to the decorations and the ambience of the room. The good Queen room can accommodate not more than 2 people.  Don't expect much as this is not a 5 star hotel.   The front desk officer name Bella was very calm in handling guests. Especially it was the peak time for check in. Also, it was on a new year and they were full house so we had to wait for our rooms to be ready for check in. Understood that they try their level best to accommodate to their guests.  Waited for about 1.5 hours to finally check in. We were tired from walking around and it was raining heavily, so we were glad that there was someone to assist…\", 'Though the room is small, it is clean and the decorations are nice. Wifi is good. Free parking is also available. Lots of food options are available nearby. Customer service is not bad. Good for a short staycation at affordable price.', 'We would like to show our compliments to the staff who handled us meticulously, Daryl. He helped us with process of checking-in efficiently and handled our queries professionally. He is truly an asset to the organisation. We can feel his sincerity, genuineness as we observe him handling other customers with the same care. Truly amazing. My boyfriend and myself come from the service-line, we know how difficult situation can be, especially now. Thank you for serving everyone, and going the extra mile for your guest. We are very pleased and would return definitely.', 'It’s a really clean and comfortable stay at Hotel G. I would specially like to mention Shawn from the Front Office for helping us expedite the check-in processes and also Housekeeping Shah for efficiently attending to our late night request for miscellaneous items such as more towels and water. Overall it’s a really pleasant stay and we would definitely visit again!

They were very professional and worked hard to ensure each guest has a pleasant and enjoyable stay,  They were truly friendly and helpful. They smiled and greeted guests with their hearts and ready to provide a helping hand.  The room and location of the hotel was excellent. Love it. Kudos to all staff.', 'The stay was short but enjoyable. Check-in was smooth & fast. The gentleman who attended to me was friendly & attentive.  Room was pleasant & the design was slick as well as modern.   The only issue is the cleanliness of the aircon vents. Quite dusty.  Toilet was clean.   Simply love the location and few minutes walk to Bugis Plus.    Upon returning to the hotel, the friendly hotel staff attending to our temperature & safe entry checks.   Please note that the laundry and slipper bags are charged at a nominal fee. Would suggest to provide another alternative option if guests were to do their own laundry back home (i.e. paper bags for laundry if environment friendly option is a concern to do plastic bags).

If you have neighbours beside u in the next room, u can practically hear their talking and laughing.  Ceilings also has this creaking contracting sound at night. Could be due to the wood or tiles. If some1 is staying above u , u can practically hear the chair shift n their heavy steps.  As much as we try to keep it simple & enjoy this staycation, we were rudely awoken at 12.30am till 1.30am by the next door neighbours grp of 4 giggling, laughing, incessant chatting till we couldn't take it and called concierge.

They provided us 2 plates of pastries for morning tea (maybe cuz our room was double occupancy), lunch with a glass of wine and another plate (only 1 this time) of sandwiches & waffles for our afternoon tea break. Thankful for the fruit juices, canned drinks and water provided in the minibar, tea and coffee was also available.   Service at check in was quick and friendly.   Overall a very worth it package, we will be back! ✌️😁', 'Me and my family stayed here for 9 nights and we enjoyed ourselves alot. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. We went to both restaurants to try the food and it was delicious. Once again, thanks Joyce for arranging for me.', \"Location nice, staff helpful too. But the rain shower didn't work, hot water kettle had dirt, one of the glasses was dirty (dried toothpaste I think?). We booked a package with Klook, which promised a free Champagne but the champagne given was not the one stated in the package, which I would have preferred. I've attached the photo of the advertised v. actual with this post.   Still, give 3 stars because the package came with $50 dining vouchers and I really enjoyed the restaurant Ginett below, and the package was still considerably value for money. Unfortunately, the multiple minor disappointments added up and prevent me from giving any stars higher.\", 'Checked in: 16 Nov 2020 Checked out: 17 Nov 2020  Booked a staycation for the mentioned dates and informed the hotel we needed the wheelchair accessible room. Unfortunately, it was not available on the day we arrived. We were informed about 1 hour before we checked in.  Room was interesting except the pillow was terrible, really flat pillows.

Took a shower and decided to take a nap. However there was a musty smell coming from the bed. We thought that it was from the duvet and requested to change the cover. The cover was changed but the smell came back. It must be the duvet then. Informed reception and they advised that housekeeping would change the whole duvet and send us some water too.  Water was sent to us but the other request was not passed to the housekeeping. Explained to the housekeeping staff and she brought us a new duvet. We must compliment the housekeeping staff as she was really courteous and nice throughout the entire ordeal.  With the new duvet, we thought our worries were all resolved. Alas, a few minutes later, the smell was back. This time round, we decided to sniff for…', 'Normally I would not book hotels through Klook but I did so to utilise the Singapore Rediscover voucher.   The hotel is actually quite small but it has a hipster theme. (Reminds me of the Papa Wale hotel in Taipei)  For the price I paid, its value for money for Singapore standards. Nice and clean but its a tiny room. If you pay slightly more, you can opt for M Social on Klook and get a bigger room.   Pros: Nice and clean but really no facilities in the hotel. Eateries near hotel and Bugis is a 5 min walk. The service staff was prompt in her emails, etc. Excellent service overall...  Cons. The sink in the room is tiny, the pillows need to be thicker, the carpark entrance confusing.

I would like to appreciate Belle's customer service to take initiative by leading me to my hotel room. The room is just right for solo or couple to settle down and everything is clean especially the toilet which I'm concerned about the most. Well Done... I will definitely stay here again in the future.\", 'Was very impressed during the checkin especially with Ana, she was very polite, friendly and quick! Raven from Ginett restaurant was great as well too, she was calm and composed even though the restaurant was swamped.

The stay was pleasant as the service was good.  Requested for a change in the room as the wind was hitting onto the external facade too loudly, and the reception immediately helped us with it.  Breakfast served at the 25 Degrees cafe was awesome as well. The waitress by the name Abigaile was really helpful and friendly towards us.  Overall, an awesome experience!', 'Great location in the city/town area where there’s abundance of food available. Greeted with excellent service by Daryl Lim at the front desk when I arrived. He was very quick with our administration.   However a little disappointed on the room size, it was not as spacious as it was shown in the picture. There wasn’t much TV channel available as well.   Do note that there’s only 1 complimentary parking for an exit so I do not advise you to drive there as parking is pretty expensive. $1/30 mins for weekdays and weekends. It would be great if Hotel G is able to look into this.', 'smooth check in , spacious room , good locati wason at middle rd , with food voucher 50 dollars , breakfast provided . professional staff . good layout of room , nice facilities spacious desk , comfortable bed . feel relaxed .

As we are driving, this hotel offered free parking. We arrived earlier than the check-in time and immediately the counter staff assist us in the check-in. There is a little bit of walking from the hotel entrance to the room though. The room is clean, with a bean bag inside and a small TV. There is complimentary wifi, water bottles and coffee machine provided. Hot water is almost instant, bed is comfy & soft while the air-con isn't too cold. We liked the fact that it is located away from the city and that it is more near to nature. It is unfortunate that Changi Boardwalk is closed for some upgrading work at the moment but Changi Village is still within walking distance away. The room has a writable wall that you can draw anything on it, next day breakfast is provided as well and I must say the breakfast is quite good and delicious. Overall very good experience and definitely we will consider to go back this hotel for another staycation.…\", \"i've been in this hotel a few years ago, & had good memories, but this time was a little different. i like the fact that it's a modern hotel in faraway Changi. i'd booked the room type specifically for that hanging cocoon chair, but what what i got was a crappy bean bag instead, & the room was facing a military installation so the windows are frosted up. i can't decide if not having a window or having a frosted window that could only be opened a little was more depressing.\", 'We had a 3D2N staycation with a 7yr old and 3yr old. The hotel is tied up to “Changi Civil Service Club” so you had variety of things to enjoy. We enjoyed swimming, bowling, playing by the beach, sand playground, nature walk. The hotel loan as a board games that kids enjoyed playing..We havent done biking though it will be a good one due to the nature PCN pathways. Shout out to Uncle Rahim, Juani, Alisya, Li Ping and Ritz who assisted us from welcome , our rooms and breakfast.', 'Very nice atmosphere. Serene location to be out of the hustle and bustle of city life. Room facilities are very clean and confortable. Close proximity to changi boardwalk. Can walk, take free shuttle or bus to changi village. Great place for getaway and family staycation.', 'Good location hotel that surrounded by nature. There are some huge and tall trees in the hotel area. Near to the beach club, boardwalk, (haunted) old changi hospital, changi village.  Restaurant is quite decent but the breakfast was to simple and worth to skip and find it outside if expect better breakfast to cheer up your day. Room quality is fine with the price range, but during high season can feel the lack of manpower to clean up the room as we found that the floor inside the room was very dusty.', 'Came in at 9 am, trying for early checked in as suggested by her colleague when we booked the room. On the actual day room is not even ready by 1.30 pm. Checked few times and SOP answer given \"our standard check in time is 3pm.\", without even trying to check with their house keeping team how long more room is ready, while she was just seated all the time while no other customer. 0 customer experience, no compassion.', 'The quietness is rare in busy Singapore. We appreciated this during our staycation. Was disappointed to find out that there was no mini fridge in the room. Room was comfortable and adequate. The breakfast was huge! Enough to last till late afternoon. We appreciate the friendly staff who manned the temperature taking counter. He never failed to greet guests and was always willing to help out. ', 'This property is located in peaceful Changi area. Major point of interest are Changi Point Boardwalk and Changi Village where the hawkers sell very tasty local foods.  Hotel is quiet and very slow pace compare to others hotels in the downtown area. Room is nice and shower water pressure is strong. Breakfast was Okay coffee ☕️ was good.   Will return again.', 'My family took a staycation here during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hotel is situated in the tranquil Changi area away from the bustle of Changi Village, yet easily accessible to the many shops, eateries and Pulau Ubin ferries via a bus or short walk.  Changi Cove has a couple of blocks to it and there was some walking and a couple of flights of stairs or two elevators to get our rooms (our kids had their own room). However, there is a lot of nature along the way so the walk is qhite pleasant.  The rooms were rather comfy with decent amenities like kettle, toiletries, TV and coffee maker. However, although there is a safe, there are no mini bars in the room.  The beds are comfy and the towels are, for this budget of hotel, surprisingly fluffy and soft. Each room also comes with a…', \"This was supposed to be a great place and there were many pictures in the website to prove it too.  We didn't realize until we checked-in how much it has been affected by the pandemic. Glory was pretty much gone. There were lot of evidences to indicate that the hotel was primarily serving 'stay home notices' few months back.  Rooms are very small but well cleaned. Other amenities were all right. View from the room was poor. Windows weren't property cleaned either.  No room service. Restaurant had limited capacity and very limited menu.  This hotel is not very far from Changi Village, where there is no limit to food options.  Perhaps it will return to its original state in the future.\", 'Our group was well taken care of by your team. Will highlight efforts especially of the front desk & restaurant wait staff. Alvist & Sierra left an impression, camaraderie was good.  Would be great if you would enhance the stairs connecting lobby-level2-incubatorlevel with motion sensor lighting. We do climb the stairs especially when it’s just 1 flight we’re conquering.', '6 noteworthy findings during my staycation:  1) merely 2 mins walk to the start of the Changi Boardwalk through the lush landscape leading to the Changi Beach. The boardwalk leads to Coachman Inn restaurant where you can dine with the 180 degree view of the Changi Beach.  2) delivery of what we ordered at The Olive Tree to the comfort of our rooms. Just like room service! Olive Tree staff was very enthusiastic. The Danish pastries served is good.  3) The hotel is a quiet and beautiful sanctuary. The bed is very comfortable. The room is very clean and well-maintained! Possibly the only hotel in Singapore with a ceiling to floor doodle board. The writings are easily wiped off with just a wet cloth provided.    4) Fast technician support when we asked for an extra chair and…', \"I am disappointed that the reception of this hotel is not welcoming.   I am totally ok with respecting the covid rules, but it shouldn't mean being rude with customers, not smiling to the clients and not doing any effort to offer the quality of services we are expecting.  There is no tourist in SG, that is why the money of the people living in SG is important for the hotels. I will not return.  Not a good experience at all 😏\", 'It should always start with a great welcoming from the staff. That was completely missed. The guy at the check in counter was cold as ice, not smiling, and only interested in getting our passeports and credit card. There are better ways to welcome visitors, especially during the pandemic.  Then, the room is not very fancy, quite cold...  The staff at the bar/restaurant were ok, but again, not a single smile.  I would not recommend at all this hotel for a staycation in Singapore, despite its location, so close to the fantastic Changi boardwalk. ', \"Stayed here a year ago and returned again for a weekend staycation.   Hotel occupancy was healthy, considering that there were no weddings and corporate events in light of Covid-19 measures.   Staff were polite, prompt and efficient in enforcing safe distancing measures while attending to guest needs.   Menus are now contactless (scanning a QR code brings you to an online menu), and breakfast served on a plate (you can ask to switch some of the components, e.g. have milk and cornflakes instead of egg. Hand sanitisers are installed throughout the hotel.   Friendly doorman greeted everyone and took their temperature. Had ready advice on weather and fishing opportunities.  I'll be back!\", \"Hotel staff are good; rooms are clean and Changi is calm place. But there is not much to do in the hotel if you are planning a staycation esp. with young children. It is hard to understand why a 4 hectare property doesn't have its own Swimming pool and Gym (have to use it at neighboring club: Covid period robbed this opportunity also)! Also, TV doesn't have any kids channels. A special book in the room, good breakfast, helpful frontdesk (including the uncle keeping doors) are pleasant experiences... and probably the reason why I gave an extra star.\", 'Booked a standard King room, bed was comfortable, adequate room size and bathroom has an inviting white and wood minimalist deco. There is a Nespresso machine with two complimentary capsules and some chocolates to welcome us. Hotel Staff are nice and friendly. In-house guests can use the very-nearby Changi beach club pool to swim and its just a 3 mins walk away to the starting point of Changi Broadwalk. Great place for nature lovers and birders to spot birds. We truly enjoyed our stay at Changi cove', 'My friend and I went on an 11-day SE Asia cruise out of Singapore and flew in 3 days early for some pre-cruise sightseeing. We had planned to go to Shanghai post-cruise but cancelled that segment, not because we thought we’d get sick but because some flights in and out of China were already being cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak and we didn’t want to get stranded. We booked additional time in Singapore and we  chose the Chsngi Cove Hotel because the rates at our first hotel jumped way up. This is a really nice place, very clean and modern, with spacious rooms, a pleasant coffee shop and a nice courtyard. Desk is staffed 24/7 which is a huge plus. Staff members are very friendly and helpful - they’ll book taxis and restaurant reservations and print out your travel docs…', 'I chose to stay here as an alternative from an expensive airport hotel. It isn’t very close to the airport though: I’d pre-booked a taxi and it wasn’t cheap. However, it is in a quiet location and I enjoyed exploring the boardwalk by the bay – although the signs warning about how to deal with packs of dogs were rather disconcerting! The gardens of the hotel were pretty but there wasn’t a view of the sea although it is nearby. The room was simple but comfortable. The receptionist guided me how to take public transport by bus and metro to the centre of Singapore. Although the hotel takes individual guests they’re obviously set up more for catering for large groups.', 'Great hotel. It is somewhat away from the city center but you get a much lower rate than in town. The rooms are quite ok and clean. Unless you want to spend most of your stay in the hotel this is a good place to stay. It shares facilities with the nearby Beach Club (Pool and Gym), but it has a sufficiently extensive breakfast buffer and soom decent lunch and dinner options. It is near (1.5 km) Changi Village which is a pleasant walk and where you have a large variety of local food stalls. Taxi to town takes about S$25 one way and Grab is about the same. Under 15 minutes to the airport.', 'We had a lovely stay at Changi Cove, that was made wonderful with the attentive staff. Would like to mention Mr.Rahim who stands by the doors, in the lounge area to greet guests in the morning at breakfast, and when we checked out. His genuine smile and warmth touched our hearts and made the stay even more so meaningful.', \"We stayed here for two nights, in between flying from the UK and going out to Aus. The room was very clean, quiet and dark, the beds were really comfortable - so we had two good sleeps. The breakfast was great, and the staff were very kind and helpful. We got soaked in heavy rain on the Changi Boardwalk nearby when out sightseeing for the day, and although we'd checked out (we had an evening flight) they provided towels to dry off.  Changi Village / hawker centre and Changi Museum are close by. It's a 15 min bus ride to the MRT to the centre of Singapore, so we found it a great place to stay.\", \"We were so glad we chose to break up our journey and stay at Changi Cove, it was just perfect for us! 24 hour reception, excellent staff, a very nice breakfast, clean & cool room...everything was just great. We struggled to get a large taxi van to the airport but the staff were kind enough to help us with that. I couldn't fault our stay - well done Changi Cove!\", 'I had a 21hr stopover and all the transit hotels in airport were full. I had my nephew look for a hotel and book it for me from overseas.  At 2am I was at the reception ready to pay the $94.00 advertised on booking.com. I was half asleep but when the receptionist announced the price of $260.00 I got wide awake, nearly having a stroke. I showed her the advertised price and she said because it is from the booking agency. She knew that I was stranded and they must do this often because it was so easy and so natural for her to invent a price.   As I was getting there I noticed another hotel the Raintr33 and I grabbed my luggege and walked out. The half bold manager became somewhat rude.  I do not know how the hotel is but I would not go there anymore and I suggest you too stay far…', \"It was just for a night between flights. Although the hotel is in Changi, just as the airport, to get here (15min by taxi) it doesn't take much less than to go into the city center. The taxi charged me 20 SGD, on the way back 13 SGD.  Staff at reception was friendly, but I am glad I arrived not too late in the evening, since the restaurant 'White Olive', just opposite the reception, closes at 10pm and there is nowhere elso to go nearby. At 9pm for dinner I was all by myself, eating my 'Mee Goreng'. The attending lady was extremely friendly, and I also enjoyed the rich breakfast buffet, with fresh fruit, Swiss Premium Yoghurt (by Emmi), smoked salmon, camembert, freshly prepared eggs to order, various cooked Asian dishes.

Initially wanted to stay from 9am to 3pm ( $110 nett ) but decided to extend 3 more hours to 6pm (extra $30 for 3 hours ). The staff was efficient. Overall the stay was good and surroundings were very very peaceful and quiet. I didnt like the fact that i had to stayed at 6th floor. Had to walk quite a distance from 2nd floor and the linkway to the room was abit too far. ', 'Decided to go for a quiet 3 days/2 nights retreat. Choose Changi Cove as it is well located in the midst of nowhere... Changi is one end of Singapore, rustic, good place to go for a slow walk. Changi Cove is well built for silent retreat. Checking in was smooth and the counter staff are very courteous, helpful, and efficient. Went to the room that is simple but functional. Bathroom is clean and cosy. Started the stay well. Managed to take a walk along Changi Point Boardwalk in the morning of my 2nd day. Nice and easy 18 minutes walk from Changi Beach Club to Changi Sailing Club another 18 minutes back, nice and scenic walk. Breakfast spread (included in the package) is good and appetizing. Had a good 2 days of reflection. Only shortcoming is the window in the room is lock and 2…', 'I used to stay at Village Hotel Changi, but decided to give Changi Cove a go. I was not disappointed.   The hotel is a little on the no-frills side - think along the lines of \"clean, modern, simple\". Our stay was a refreshing break from the city, helped by the fact that the hotel was set amidst the jungle canopy.   The breakfast spread was moderate, but the dishes were good. To get to the pool (on the premises of Changi Beach Club), you\\'ll need to take a 200m walk.  The staff were friendly and prompt, and morale seemed high.   I\\'ll definitely be back!', 'In our mind this is a great place for an overnight stay if transiting through Singapore. Check in was fine. The rooms are a bit of a trek to get to but having been there before we were fine. We had dinner here this time. Meals were very nice. Breakfast was ok but nothing special. It was only a $12 SGD trip in a Grab car (think Uber). Will definitely stay here again if needed.', 'The most amazing visit, welcomed by your Concierge who is truly brilliant, the food was fabulous. Spotlessly clean and so helpful. The visit was great and we walked to Changi Village and Hawker Center, we will return again. Only one disappointment Changi jail was shut.', 'Stayed one night in a Deluxe King room with hubby for a quiet respite from the hustle of the city.  The location of hotel is right at the quiet corner of Changi Village. We enjoyed our stay pretty much.  Loved the serenity of the place.  The hotel is a short walk to the famous Changi Village for all the yummy food and beach.  Hotel is quite accessible via private hire or taxis.  There are bus service at the Changi Village area.   Room is clean and the bathroom is clean and well maintained.  The hotel rooms are located at another building thus one need to walk some distance before reaching the hotel block.  The distance is very minimal though.  It is sheltered so no worries if it rains.  The breakfast spread is not too bad.

Breakfast did not start until 7.00am, so don't go if you need an early start. The hotel actually takes the deposit and has to refund as opposed to cancel, so check your credit card statements (according to the receptionist,7 - 14 days).

It is a 35 minutes walk to Changi Village by the scenic boardwalk or 20 minutes following the road (many buses passing by).

We used the swimming pool several times which is great, huge, mostly deserted and about a three minute walk. The hotel itself was quite echoey, the people nice us had a creaky laminate floor and kept different hours to us, so we were woken up often by them only walking around, and doors open and closing echoes down the corridors.

The room was comfortable, and the shower was refreshingly roomy (no elbows at sides, or bending to get beneath the nozzle).  Breakfast was well-presented, varied and more than satisfying.

During the day the large tree on the way to your room is really lovely and I’d imagine it would be relaxing sitting by there.

The staff were mostly friendly and smiley :) would love to come back again!!\", 'With the beach and the Changi board walk just round the corner, Changi Cove is what I would describe as a good venue for small conferences.  Room are nice and neat and ample size. Bathroom was well appointed. What was surprising was that in this hot tropical climate, the room did not have a fridge to chill the drinks purchased from outside.  What was also lacking, which I find surprising for a hotel this size is a pool and a gym. Granted that the beach and board walk is round the corner but not everyone wants to go to the beach and the weather may not be favourable for a walk along the board walk.  Food options are quite limited in the immediate vicinity but Changi Village is a 20 min walk away.  Question is would I come back here for a staycation? The answer is probably not.

Far location. So choose wisely.', ' Came here for a weekend staycation and I am pleased with the room. I saw many complains about it being too small but at the price, I was happy with the size. It was clean and cosy as well. It also came with a really hearty buffet breakfast. You don’t have any cheap food close by but the nearest is at Changi Village, about a 3 minutes cab ride away. Overall, a great stay and totally recommended if they continue to maintain the place well.', 'My wife recently spent one night here on our way back to Australia. It is a $10 SGD Grab taxi ride from the airport. Check in staff were fabulous and we were escorted to our room which was lucky cos it was a bit of a hike. Room was small but perfect for our overnight use. It is probably not in an area where you would spend 3-4 days but it suited our needs. The guy at the front desk was very helpful with suggestions for our dinner and getting GRab taxis for pickup.

Location wise it is very near Changi Village and matter of fact can take the boardwalk all the way there!

There is also a lovely coastal walk and a nearby bus to Changi village and to Tampine (a planned community with lots of food and shopping options).

We saw more than 6 eagles (walk to the boardwalk, a 5min way away from Changi Cove) and 4 hornbills (one flew right past me. It was awesome!)  The place is a safe haven away from the city, packed with amenities so you’re enjoying the best of both worlds.', \"This was our second visit back to Changi Cove after having stayed there just a year ago. We had loved it so much the first time and this second visit was just as lovely. The hotel is still a wonderful, quiet getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life and it is just a 25 minute walk to Changi Village where a variety of great food awaits. It's a great place to take a break and take in the quiet sounds of nature. I would consider going back again except for the rather unfriendly front desk service we received on arrival and on checking out. There were no smiles, no words of welcome and no words of thank you. This was inexplicable for an establishment where the rest of the staff, particularly the staff we met at breakfast, were professional and friendly.\", 'Tucked in the far corner of Singapore with really nothing much to distract one,  Hanoi Cove is a great place for a retreat to rest and just chill and enjoy the sea and nature.  The rooms are well equipped especially love the nespresso machine and the scribble wall. It is the place to go for a retreat and do nothing. The breakfast is a good spread with egg and noodle station and good croissants.  There is a guest lounge that’s great for quiet afternoon. Lots of space to find a quiet corner to read and rest. And there’s a heritage Jelutong tree in the garden that’s is treasured. All in all, a great place for a retreat. ', 'We checked in on 13 March 2018 for 4 nights with total 5 rooms. We had a very comfortable and memorable stay in this hotel. Location is suitable as we attend Kingdom Invasion Conference in the Singapore Expo, you can walk to the close by Changi Village for wonderful hawker food. Grab service is easy to get at this area too.  What I love the most is the staffs in the hotel, they are so friendly, so helpful, especially to Mr Rahim and Mr Khairul from the front desk. Seems like we have known them for years, they are just an awesome ppl.  The room has what you need, love the Nespresso coffee machine,the lemongrass shower gel and Comfy bed.  They had a beautiful ballroom which we have the opportunity to witness 3 wedding dinner during the week. love the function room set up too.. it…', 'We had a one night staycation and we enjoyed it. Breakfast was not of variety but they had what we required and filled our stomach. Place away from the city life... Beatiful and we truly enjoyed it.  No swimming pool. But five mins walk to chngi beach club was a plus', 'Had an awesome and refreshing 4 days stay at Changi Cove. Surrounded by nature, a peaceful ambience and comfortable bed, I think its a good place for corporate retreats, family staycation and personal get away. Its a tuck away gem in Singapore, far from the maddening crowd but not so far from civilization that you can still get to amenities at the Changi village if you need to. Only 5 min to the coastal broadwalk.   Wish I could stay longer but glad to have this opportunity for this get away admist the hustle and bustle of everyday work.  Pearl', \"We literally just stayed the one night while getting another flight, this hotel surprised me so much. Was my boyfriend's birthday, they had wrote on the wall for him as there's a white board wall, we went for dinner, come back and there was a brownie for him with a candle. On check in they were so friendly and helpful, rooms were a good size, bathroom was good too with a really powerful shower. Had all the amenities you could want like tea and coffee, toothpaste, toothbrush shower gel. On check in the staff were so friendly and helpful and again on check out. We had a really quick breakfast in the morning but was pleasantly surprised, again staff were friendly, there was plenty of food available with a wide range.

The service is excellent both at the reception and restaurants. Special shout out to Justin, who assisted us with our room and recommended great dining options. It definitely made our stay a relaxing and sumptuous experience! :)', \"We enjoyed our first night stay that we've decided to extend another night. The bay view area is nice especially at night. The room and toilet is very clean and comfortable and the staff who assisted us (Prem and Doris) were exceptionally great. The best thing about a hotel stay is not just the room experience but also the guest service experience. We felt welcomed from the very beginning and would recommend others to stay here. Can't wait for travel to be back again so more tourists can enjoy this stay too!\", 'The very green design of the hotel makes a very refreshing escape within the city.  We tried 3 of restaurants in the hotel and really enjoyed the food. Justin was very helpful and ensured we had a pleasant time during our stay.  From booking to check out was hassle free.', 'Room was spacious and newly renovated.  TV is LG 55’ IPTV and you could use Chromecast. It would be great if they included a small guide on how to connect. There is a nespresso machine for coffeeholics like myself. The shower and bathtub are separate and it is great. Water pressure and rain shower are OK. Bathtub cleanliness could be improved further. There are 2 toilet bowls I’m not really sure why.  I stayed at the signature Marina Bay room and enjoyed the view of blue sky and MBS. There is also a room balcony that you can go out to take pictures. Do note if you didn’t lock the balcony, aircon will turn off. Aircon can be controlled from 20-25 degrees celcius. Top floors and rooftop swimming pool seem to be still under renovation. Gym has a variety of equipment. Inner Decoration is garden oasis, quite nice. Location is in Marina Square so you can go shopping and chill and eat as well.  Peppermint restaurant breakfast is local, just wondering why as we go staycation we prefer to eat seasonal specialty from other countries and other local food(again). Dinner was full due to Ramadan. Do check for happy hour at the atrium lounge if you like to drink.  Overall, Prem and Doris were very attentive, polite for left and helpful in resolving my issues, malign sure that the staycation was great. Thank you for your great hospitality. I look forward to visiting again when the higher floors are completed and more twin bedrooms are available.  …', 'Indeed a very memorable 3D2N stay. Feels like a mini Gardens By the Bay.

Very proactive and hospitable staff too from the concierge to the reception to the restaurant making us feel very welcomed and at home. Waking up to an array of  breakfast including heavenly nasi lemak and delectable dim sum at Peppermint with super attentive and responsive staff was amazing. Marina Square shopping mall is just next door which makes is so convenient to shop, dine or engage in activities for children too. Will definitely return again! THANK YOU!!', 'Had a splendid staycay. Newly renovated hotel, room space was generous for small family of 3. View from the room was amazing.  Special thanks to Lydia for the smooth check in process and accommodate to my request for the late check out.

And the F&B team in Peppermint, especially Stewart.', 'We opted for the lifestyle room and was glad that the room space was generous for my parents and I. Toilet has a bathtub btw (yay bathbomb)!!!!

Will definitely recommend this to anyone who’s looking for a place to chill over the weekend 😊', 'Greeted by Nadia when we checked in. Much professionalism displayed. Nice view overlooking Marina Bay. Good hospitality. Just a one nite stay and had buffet dinner there. Great food nice ambience. Gym equip with state of the art machine.  It is so enjoyable and great experience for our stay.', 'Is a birthday staycation for my hubby and kids but things doesn’t goes well at all.  1. Check in waited for awhile coz priority was given to those people who wanted to check out. After we check in they informed us they are having a soft launch. ( for this I still can accept even though they should email us way before our check in date which we book this at least 3 month ago) 2. After we went in to our room, the room is nice. Kids wanted to soak in the bath tub. The moment I went in the bathroom, i saw hairs in the bath tub but the best part is along the ream of the tub there is tissue wrap with hair laying at the corner of the tub  ( that really gross me up) so I tell myself is okie as long as I don’t use the bathtub it will be fine. Even though the 2nd day I ask for…', \"Love the day bed in the newly renovated room, room was really clean. The property was able to accommodate a room next to mine with my girlfriend and her family, I almost forgot about this request until the check in staff reminded me ☺ Service was tip top, greeted with a very positive attitude everywhere we went. Was surprised with a complimentary mini birthday cake for my girlfriend's birthday too! Just a small issue, part of the swimming pool was under renovation however my daughter still enjoyed her swim very much!

The exceptional service that was delivered by the hotel staff allowed us to enjoy ourselves largely stress-free throughout this entire process. The Garden Ballroom is definitely one of the most modern and beautiful ballroom in Singapore as of now after the major facelift that was completed at the start of 2021. In addition, food was delicious and the portion was huge.   The team that was led by the experienced Banquet Manager, Kelvin, and proficient AV Lead, Tarmizi, ensured that everything was executed smoothly and on point during the banquet.

Staff were very friendly. Queue was pretty long at check-in but i was glad that there were 6 staff handling the process and beverages were offered to guests in the queue.  Fitness Centre was chic. Love the concept. The machines were among the latest, very user friendly.   Room was chic. Quite modern and pleasing to the eyes. The closet and minibar very nicely hidden. The shower cubicle was a bit too small. It fits 1 person. Bathtub was pretty shallow but was good. There is a water dispenser beside the tap. Great idea but.. you can't fill up your bottle or the one provided in the room because, the dispenser was short. You can use the glasses provided…\", 'Thank you Parkroyal Collection! Efficient check-in/out. Service was great by the hotel team.  Breakfast spread was good. Those looking for halal options, this hotel is a sure to go.

Oh and pre-booking of the facilities is all done via online. We will be looking forward to have our next staycay here again!', 'My wife and I stayed at ParkRoyal (Marina) from 25-28 Feb.   I was truly impressed by the services of Suresh and Alfiro (not sure if I got your spelling right).   As I was waiting for my cab to arrive, we had a good chat. We talked about exciting places to visit around the area and the chat went on about working experiences in the hotel/ service industry.   Suresh & Alfiro was passionate in their conversations and this makes the experience so engaging! It didn’t seem as if they were in a rush; they took their time and took genuine interest in their conversations with hotel guests. x02 Thumbs up!

She explained to us regarding the pool, and breakfast covid regulations during our stay. The check in process was quick too! The room is spacious, & well organized. Love the new interior. Thank you to Ms Syahira for arranging the anniversary cake for us. We were suprised, and definitely love the ondehondeh cake!  For breakfast, staffs attended to us were very friendly, and thoughtful. Just that maybe the choices of food is not much due to covid but still its scrumptious.  Upon checking out, it was pleasant and super fast like as Ms Syahira attended to us.

Overall, I enjoyed my staycation at Park Royal Collection Marina Bay!', 'We last stayed here in 2014, I remember it looked dated even back then so this revamp is very much needed.  The atrium on the 4th floor is beautiful, certainly evokes a feeling of calmness and tranquility compared to the concrete jungle just outside the doors.   Check in was fast and effortless, we bought our package on KLOOK with our SGRV which came with a room upgrade and 2pm check-out. As we needed 2 rooms, we got 2 adjoining rooms on the 14th floor, with a view of the Fountain of Wealth and the Marina Reservoir off to the side.   Rooms are newly furbished, with laminate flooring and a modern look. Functional and neat. Our rooms also had a little daybed and the balcony is accessible.

The food here is really good as well. Many of our guests told us that the menu was very creative and absolutely delicious. Totally not what they expected from a hotel reception.

Having a lunch reception also meant that there were birds chirping throughout the wedding, making it seem like a real life garden!   Overall I would…\", 'We had a fabulous experience. The DM, Ms Doris guest service was the one who made our stay wonderful and memorable. She personally came up to the room to understand the issue and at once she offered an apology and extend a complimentary breakfast.  The concierge Mr Nawi was so so pleasant.

We would recommend this hotel to others who are keen for a fuss-free garden-themed wedding.', \"First time staying at this hotel since it's makeover. Rooms were clean and comfy. We stayed on the 14th floor and had the view of Suntec City. Best part is the toilets had bidets so yeah, major plus points.  The only thing that we missed out is that we did not get the chance to use the pools coz it was already fully booked when we checked in. So yeah, can just imagine the disappointment on my kids' faces.  We did not take breakfast at the hotel coz the hotel is surrounded by malls and there are restaurants nearby too.\", 'One of the best hotel I have been throughout my entire holidays.Never realise of the gem in my country.

Firstly, the stay at the hotel and secondly, the wedding experience.  -Stay at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay- The hotel is newly renovated at our time of visit. The urban rooms were nice and cosy and we had an unblocked view of MBS. The amenities provided in the room was sufficient and most of the housekeeping/ room service requests can be done via a QR Code by the bedside.   The bridal suite was equally good and equipped with 2 bathrooms, one in the main bedroom (with bathtub) and another in the living room area (no bathtub). Only feedback is that the wardrobe is too small for the amount of attires we had (3x wedding dress + 1 gua). Sunlight was good for make up.   There were bird cages hung along the walkway on level 4 with real birds…', 'Organised  a family staycation for the children. The hotel recently opened in Dec 2020 and parts of the hotel was still under renovation. The parking leading up to the carpark was partly closed so the initial track up to the hotel was quite challenging. However, the concierge staff was kind enough to let us park in front of the hotel for the duration of our stay.   The room was very new and recently renovation. But the beds were really single size. so it was quite a squeeze for the 4 of us and then I had asked for an extra bed in the end which proved very helpful for my quality of sleep.   Service staff was also really helpful and prompt answering the call and attending to our needs.

However, management and maintenance side I think require more attention for improvement: 1. Upon check-in , we appreciate to let us have early check-in. But when we asked to give us the nicest room upon the room category that we booked, ended up to our dismay , the room given was totally not yet tidied up and seems like just left by previous guest. Isn’t during this Covid period they should alternate the guest’s stay? Also we checked the room view and it is not the Marina bay view that we have booked. So-call Marina bay view is you need to go to the corner or out to balcony then can see Marina bay view.

No more plastic bottles or boiling water! The water is fit for drinking and is really useful for making formula milk.  The staffs were also friendly and helpful. A cot and steam sterilizer was prepared on our arrival which helps us a lot. Due to covid, the hotel also opened the ballroom to cater for breakfast guests. Overall I really love the greenery and natural feel of the hotel.  Currently, this place is still on soft launch and because of covid, is sad that they only can put 1 chair in the room.

If you are not sensitive to those, then go ahead to book your staycation now with its current low rates.   We did request for a change of room and the noise did subside. The design of the lobby garden in the hotel’ is beautiful with real chirping birds and the sculpture of wind chimes waves hanging at the lobby as a feature is indeed charming. But again if you are sensitive to noise, then you maybe disturbed by it as the birds sing as early as 8am.....Or charmed by it by waking you up gently...Combined with the lobby music, it tend to become quite loud. Not for everyone but it is certainly unique. I am told the pool is a mineral pool but…', 'Just had a staycation at this newly renovated hotel.

As expected, the rooms were clean and spacious. The bed and pillows were just right for us, offering great comfort.

Personally, I am really heartened by Jackie’s quick and reassuring responses. She helped look for the wallet and got back to us double quick time (it was already late and probably near to the close of business for the day; if not past her working hours). She even offered to arrange for a team member to send the wallet to our residence, which we declined trying not to impose too much of a hassle to the team (instead we opted to collect on the next working day).

There is still soft renovation work which you can hear faintly during the day.  Must try is Peppermint buffet lunch, although pricey but value for quality and taste.

Rooms were really small for handicap bound. Nice stay overall.', 'It was located above Farrer Park Mrt station and near to City Square Mall. Very convenient. Breakfast was limited with choice of set A, B, C, D. Food served was cold, toast was hard. Waitress served tea and coffee without sugar or milk, and she seems unhappy to bring the sugar to us. We book a loft room, with an extra bed at the lower level, it was super squeezy for 3 adults. There was an unpleasant stench on the fabric sofa, the management should look into this. Called up the hotel a couple of times for early check in but was told to call on day of check in. On day of check in, called and was told to call again nearer the check in time! No difference at all then. Anyhow if you are looking for a cheap get away, this is still ok!', 'It was a great experience staying at Park Hotel Farrer Park. Great rooms. Their pool is also great.

Staff informed of complimentary drinks and to wait at Blue Jasmine, an in-house restaurant on Level 5.  Was able to sit, rest, have a drink and wait for the staff to approach you at your table with your keycards once your room is ready.  This is such a thoughtful gesture.

      "{'Name': 'M Social Singapore Hotel', 'Overall Rating': '4.0', 'Reviews': ['Booked this staycation using the SGRV. A few hits and misses about this hotel:   Let’s talk about the good things first:   - Early check-in – Take note to book your check in slot online. There is no notification from Klook to do so. Happened to view the M Social website and saw the check in reservation link. Booked the check in slot for 12pm, and the room was ready when we arrived at 12pm.  - Room was generally clean and the bed was comfy but small (see misses below).  - Standard hotel items e.g. hair dryer, bathrobes, bath slippers, and toiletries were provided. Tea and coffee were also provided, with a kettle.  - Value for money – after utilising the SGRV, we paid only $118 for the room, so cannot really complain but thought I should give me honest feedback on the ‘misses’ so that others can consider if this price is worth the experience.   And a longer list of ‘misses’: - Prior to my arrival, I’ve read past reviews online and on TA. Apparently, there WERE complimentary parking at the foyer, a few lots on a first-come-first-served basis. Please note there is NO MORE complimentary parking. We naively parked at the foyer area and proceeded to check in, only to be informed by the hotel staff that the parking is not complimentary. And note that there is NO grace period. For that few mins, we had to pay $5 (refer to the parking rates displayed at the Front Desk)!!!   For drivers, pls do not drive past the gantry, into the foyer area. Instead, go straight and turn left to enter the UP@Robertson Quay carpark. Park at level 2 (level 3 is for residents of UP). We parked from 12pm on a Sat to 11am on a Sun, total parking fee was $16 (excluding the $5 we wasted on the foyer parking). Wished that someone had detailed the parking so that we didn’t have to waste $. There is a lift from the carpark that directly leads to inside the hotel.  - The check in was done right at the entrance doors to the hotel, which to me was rather strange. After that, we were asked to join the line to collect the room keys from the Front Desk. Not sure why they decided to split the check in process like that, especially when there was hardly a queue when we reached. Couldn’t the Front Desk processed the check in all at once? I can understand if temp and safe entry checks were done at the door, but to have a computer set-up at the entrance to do check in, that’s odd.  - The bed was not the usual queen sized bed, more of a super single. And this is the first time that I see square pillows instead of rectangular pillows on a hotel bed, possibly to fit within the bed.  - The room was very small, so pls manage your expectations. We got a Loft room with the bed downstairs and a sitting area plus TV upstairs. The TV was very near to the sofa so we didn’t bother watching TV during our entire stay.  - The first room we stayed in had a constant dripping sound in the drainage. It was apparent only after we returned to the room after dinner. The technician came by but could not do anything so the Front Desk arranged for us to change room. The second room was better, no more dripping sound, and the air con was not hideously cold. We adjusted the air con to 26 degrees Celsius for the first room, but it was still super cold. And the air con was directly above the bed!  - Breakfast was average. We reached at around 9am, and was told that breakfast would take around 30 mins to be prepared.

Many of the sockets are giving way, couldn't even properly charge the phone or plug in the iron. Far from public transport yet no free parking. Parking is expensive so if you drive, be prepared to pay. Not worth the money at all. For the price, just top up a bit and you can get a much better option elsewhere. Definitely will not be staying at any of the Millennium hotels again \", 'Was greeted by a very friendly staff called Geraldine who was Super helpful and friendly. Emphasised that she wants us to enjoy and have fun :) she created a very good first impression of Social M.

She greeted us with excitement though it was a busy day at work for her. We were given complimentary drink vouchers and a dessert from the restaurant by Geraldine. We could not thank her enough for taking good care of my bestfriend on her birthday.  What stood out most about the service here is the \"attention to detail\", on point! Once again thank you very much to Geraldine and the team! A true star player!', \"Stayed in their rather small loft. There are small bugs/flies in the room and toilet. We thought we were staying in our very first hotel which doesn't provide hand towels, only to realise they do provide after day 2's housekeeping.

The lofts are exceptional - room was clean, well-maintained and amenities stocked-up. Two thumbs up to their housekeeping department!  We had breakfast & dinner at their restaurant -  food was good throughout and the service we receive from the restaurant staff, lovely!  I can go on and on.

The loft rooms we stayed in are great - pretty well maintained, lovely and clean, fluffy bed although it can be bigger (my girlfriends and I don't feel like it's a queen size bed, more like a super single?). We love the sofa too! Perfect for couch potatoes like us! We checked in on a very warm day and the AC cooled us down really quickly so thumbs up for the powerful AC!  Truth be told, I didn't really have anything to complain until the 2nd day which was our check out day. It started off with the breakfast service.

However, upon arrival, I realised that the photos of the room on websites did not do it justice! It looked so much better in reality compared to the photos taken by previous guests and other reviews.

Hence, I'd suggest coming 1-2 hours after the check-in timing if you would prefer not to queue 45 mins to check in.  Washroom: It felt very modern. The glass wall between the room and washroom made it look very chic. I also liked how the blinds for the glass wall are built into the wall so it doesn't get wet.

Entrance is at MacDonald door, take the lift up to level 4, to the hotel reception.   Parking is not free. One time ticket is $17. Meaning to say if you exit, the car park ticket would be gone. The car park rate is 1st 2 hours for $2.35 on weekends, $0.65 for the next 15 minutes. The car park is super hard to find a parking lot. Not advisable to drive there on weekends as there are continuous flow or cars going into the car park. The car park road are very narrow too.

However, the room (1116) I was given did not have any views from the window as it was a corner room and the layout was not the same as the one shown in the picture. Instead of having a table for proper dining, It was a bar top carpentry which was just beside the bed. The space felt smaller than it was depicted on the web.

The concept is really new which we had never seen elsewhere. The location is one of the major advantage. Overall excellent!!!! Highly recommended', 'The room was compact and cozy to stay. Experienced a very pleasant stay. Preferably couples and group of  friends will enjoy the stay there. Concept of no TV is a good and different idea. Thank you for the service.', \"The basin is located inside the room instead of the toilet. It feels disgusting to sleep beside the basin.   Which hotel doesn't have TV? Only this hotel.   No hotel card is given. You need to access the lift and room use an app. The app uses Bluetooth to activate the lift and unlock the room. We entered the lift and it took awhile to get the app working. By then, the lift has moved to another floor.   They think it's designed for millennials. But the titles in the toilet looks ugly. Come on. It looks like a 1960s toilet. \", 'It was the most hype hotel ever, was truly an amazing stay. As a fitness enthusiastic I always prefer having a gym in the hotel, but this hotel provide more then that, from kicking pads to trx, kettle bell, yoga mat all different kinds of equipment and open space making training more fun! their lobby include a giant 4 in a row, selfie machine that sent pictures into your email! And there is even water vending machine just at the end of the walkway.  To summarize it, this hotel really give us a very comfortable feeling and most of the things is very accessible from food to movie all can be found in this building! Awesome job Lyf! Keep up the good work! ', 'Place was very aesthetic- you cant find a corner that isnt insta-worthy!!! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful too. Stayed in the loft and it was such a lovely n comfortable stay. Conducive to study too, with friends. Will definitely come back!!!', 'A comfortable place to have a good time with friends. Very convenient place with many awesome facilities such as a ball pit. They even have a water filter. Also a very conducive place to study. Will definitely come back again!!!', 'The lobby is fun-filled with games, a ball pit and even a gif booth. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and personally, I really love the co-living space where we can connect with new individuals or get some work done!', 'Excellent service with really friendly staff. Place was amazing and would really go back there again!!! My friends and i would want to create new memories especially since it’s really near our school.', 'Stayed in the 6 bedroom apartment for a few days. Entire place had a very fresh concept and design! There was something interesting at every other corner. Staff attended to all my needs and took feedback very seriously. The apartment has every other necessity you would need and anything else, you can easily get from the mall. Great location and greater place, will definitely come back!', 'The stay was amazing. I stayed in the loft for 4 days and enjoyed every moment there – from the decor to the comfort level and amenities, everything was provided by for us. Honestly a very pleasant stay.', 'I stayed in the 2 level loft which consisted of 6 bedrooms in total!! The entire place was so clean and cosy and really affordable!! The lyf staff are super friendly and tended to every need!! The entire place is so colorful and youthful and there’s food in the mall itself so it’s a super great location!! I would definitely recommend you to stay here in the future because I will absolutely return again!!!', 'We were greeted by friendly Lyf guard, Wilfred at the counter who explained to us on the latest update of the app facility we needed to log into. It was totally a new experience for me whereby we just needed to use our mobile phone to connect to the lift and the entrance to the room. Very much a self-service residential concept. The room is enough to occupy 2 people, the bed was comfortable and everything was simply fabulous. The lobby calls for residence to mingle with other guests in a very friendly set-up of bursting colours and modern living. Thank you for making our stay comfortable.  What I like most about the place is, it is located in the Funan Mall. It is easy to just roam around the mall to look for food, shopping and even watch a movie. All under one roof.', 'Hostel like hotel.  Compact, clean and cosy room. But toilet always wet cos cannot block shower water splash  No TV, no refrigerator, no bottle drink in room.

Hope the hotel will settle the noise for the following days but i'm saying good bye to my good night sleep and prepare for a sleepy Friday 😭😭....  …\"], 'Individual Ratings': [4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0]}\n",

      "{'Name': 'PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore Hotel', 'Overall Rating': '4.5', 'Reviews': ['Since my husband and I have our anniversary in April, we decided to avail ourselves of the government’s offer and book a staycation at a subsidy.  We chose Parkroyal because of its distinctive architecture and good location.  I booked a club room because we enjoy things like all-day beverages and snacks.  We enjoyed our stay of 2D1N very much and here are some small touches that really made a difference: 1. High tea starts at 2pm but our check in time was supposed to be from 3pm.  I emailed the hotel and I got a response from Serene saying no worries, we could just come up to the lounge and get started with tea at 2pm.  We checked in seamlessly upon our arrival at 2 and were scoffing down scones in no time! 2. Evening cocktails was very fun, and the bartenders were obliging with my diet requirements of no added sugar.  3. The good service continued into the next day and we were well looked after by Jia Ying during breakfast.  We really have nothing but good memories of our lounge experience and can suggest that once you meet Serene, that’s your stay sorted!  Since this is a review after all, some negatives: a. Housekeeping can be improved, it’s not great having to make multiple requests before something is responded to. b. The gym equipment needs some sprucing up, whether old or dirty, even if the equipment is not being used due to COVID safe distancing measures, at least make sure it looks clean, otherwise the impression it gives is that the hotel is not bothered.…', 'It was a wonderful and nice experience.  Food- good,  room- excellent,  people- friendly and polite special mention to both Twinkle, Shahina (she was alone on duty at club lounge for the evening cocktail). They made us feel very welcomed and at home.  Given a chance, we will come back for round 2.', 'I would like to thank Serene and her team for the excellent service provided at the Collection Lounge.  The place was clean and cozy and the food and drinks were served quickly. They have different menu for different day of the week.  The staff were also attentive in checking if we needed more food and drinks.    Not forgetting to mention Chin at the check-in, she was very patient in going through the facilities, procedures and recommended rooms with nice scenery that met our request of having our rooms to be side-by-side.    We spent a pleasant and relaxing afternoon there.  Keep up with the excellent service!', \"My friends and I stayed at the Collection Room for one night.  Our room was clean and the service from check-in to the Collection Lounge, breakfast and check-out were very good.  The staff were attentive and willing to do their best to meet the guests' request.  I would like to thank Serene and her team (including intern Jia Ying)  for the excellent service at the Collection Lounge.  Their service were prompt and they came to our table to ask if we needed more food and drinks several times during our stay there.  We also met Serene at the Lime Restaurant for breakfast and she remembered us.  She even made me a special cup of cappuccino with little coffee taste when she knew that I don't like coffee but wanted to try.  It was really good!   When she saw us waiting to check-out on her way to the Collection Lounge, she quickly helped us with our check-out. Thank you for the excellent service, Serene & Team!  I would also like to thank one of the female staff who was serving us breakfast at the Lime Restaurant.  I did not get her name.  When we asked for yoghurt which was not in the menu, she quickly asked for our preferred flavour from the options available and managed to get for us quickly.  I was also impressed by the way she cleaned the table next to ours.  She really cleaned it very thoroughly, washing the two cloths she used with two containers of clean water.  Well done for the great service and for keeping the place clean!…\", 'We had a staycation with friends in the weekdays.  The hotel is clean , and the collection lounge food on Thursday was very good. The drinks , hot and cold had variety is wide and good.  Breakfast is good too . When we asked for things outside of the menu , the team was accommodating too . Overall service is excellent, thank you Serene and her team for her attentive care and friendly service. Made us feel very welcome. Thanks very much.', 'Stumbled upon this package, Suite Dreams Come True when browsing for next staycation. Wasn’t aware there’s such package from my last stay, I must say overall value wise it’s definitely a steal.   This is my second stay with PARKROYAL Pickering, the first was the same Junior Suite (under Collection which the difference was only the toiletries - non-Collection has the standard where Collection equip with Elemis). Suite wise nothing to shoutout, I still think this is one of the nicer, and affordable suite stay in Singapore. This time I request for a different view, and so they place me next to their Urban settings which was pretty.   The whole package includes “black car” return transfer (which was excellent), 2hrs of massage at St Gregory SPA (standard, I’d say one of the smaller…', 'Beautiful hotel with beautiful view. However, I went during the march school holidays and all facilities were fully booked. And should have more TV channels and also a bidet. Overall 7/10 only. the room is comfortable.', 'We check-out of the hotel on 4th April 2021 and had a horrible staycation.  No staff was at the driveway to welcome or assist us with our luggage. My wife had to carry our baby and struggle with the baby pram in the taxi boot while i was paying the taxi fare.  I was only given a room at 6pm when the check-in time stated 3pm. The counter staff explained that the housekeeping could not cope and the room was still being clean.  When I check-out on 4/4/21 at about 1200 noon, there was no one to assist us with our luggage or taxi calling. My family with a baby in tow had to call a taxi on our own at the driveway. While waiting for the taxi to arrive at the taxi stand, a blond European guy was swinging his golf club wildly in front of us. When i told him that my family is behind him,…', 'Attended the complementary cooking class today. Afiri the chef taught us how to make seafood pasta. He  was very friendly throughout and detailed with his instructions that I found really insightful. Great experience :)', 'Checking in was easy. Junior suite is clean and pleasant. We also met a friendly staff that assisted us on check-in, accommodating our request and answering our enquiries. Minutes to Chinatown which is convenient to get food as well. A nice place where you will wan to chill and relax as couple. Other than swimming pool, nothing much for kids to do here. Overall is still a good experience and thank you Mr. Thomas at front desk that assisted us throughout the stay!', 'I had the best staycation ever! Even i got for an appreciation gift for healthcare workers, i’m so glad i got Parkroyal Collection Pickering! I get to spend my time with my family. Seeing them happy makes me feel more happier. We get to spend alot of lovely and happily time. It’s been so long and that was much needed for me to see them that excited! It feels so great and i’m so happy! Thank you for your kind service, the delicious breakfast, the pool and everything, i love everything about it! <3', 'A great green and lush oasis in the city centre, love the greenery scattered throughout the hotel. The pool was a bit small but adequate. Theres is a nice \"forest\" walk just beside the pool. The food at Lime cafe is mediocre however, you are better dining at the food centre just next to the hotel, cheap, delicious and spoilt for choices.', 'Impressive getaway experience. Start your buffet breakfast with freshly cut tropical fruits and freshly squeezed juice. You don’t have to stand with this new normal situation. All will be delivered at your table. Upon entry at the Lime restaurant, welcome greet is expected,and you will be brought to your desired seat.  Facilities are far unique among other places. The pool is defined with a unique architecture of bird cage like design. The pool is good to depict am infinity connection to the city horizon. There is a jacuzzi beside the lap pool. There is a patio on the right-side upon exiting the 5th floor lift lobby while the pool is on the left. The hotel in my own word is the hybrid concept of modern and environmental ecology so you won’t feel the bustle of life in the city.', 'My experience was less than satisfactory. I booked for 2 complimentary in-house activities - mixologist experience and garden tour. Both activities did not take place despite confirmation via email prior to the dates, as well as during check in. We were told that the mixologist did not turn up when we reported for the activity at the lime bar at 3pm and were offered a glass of wine as an apology. The garden tour was worse - we received a confirmation call at about 10+am confirming the tour scheduled for 11.30am and to meet at level 5. We reached before 11.30am and waited till 11.45am. There was no staff deployed to conduct the tour. There was an ROM ceremony and when my husband tried to enter the garden next to where the ROM ceremony was held to check if there was any staff…', 'Back for another staycation. Everything is not only good, but I would say very good. The garden view room. . The more than friendly service from all the staff I met. The fantastic location of the hotel. However, I had a very strange experience with the One Connect service person on duty on 27Mar (Sat) around 4pm. I called to inform that I do not need housekeeping for my 3 day stay. I was told, please call back tomorrow as she has no way to notify. I was like ‘fine, then can I have r extra towels’? The operator asked ‘how many?’. I said 3. She said ‘how many people is staying in the room?’. Me ‘2’. She replied ‘hmm... you need that many??’. Me ‘well, it’s for 3 days and I do not want housekeeping and there’s only 2 towels in the room now’. I didn’t see a need to explain that my…', 'The room is not thoroughly cleaned before I checked in, with dirty bits, dust and hair remaining everywhere. Even if I requested for recleaning TWICE, the cleaning job is not properly done. Unbelievable for a five star and award winning hotel.', 'wonderful amenities and exciting adventure of the area. a recommended stay of delight and soulful rejuvenation. room was a pleasant tropical encapsulation of senses and very neat and tidy with a refreshing concept in comparison to other 5-6 star hotels.', 'Good location with lots of nice restaurants/food around. Instagramable swimming pool. Room is clean and bed is comfy. Breakfast is good but should have more variety. Most important services is good. Manage to get early check in too. Thumbs up.', 'Good stay and excellent concierge services. Perhaps more variety of vegetarian dishes in the normal menu would be a great help. Food quality is great and the morning breakfast service is well managed and the staff is sincere and diligent.', 'Always wanted to stay in this hotel with magnificent facade. Managed to get early check-in. However, not much explanation on the facilities, the how-to, bookings available, etc. Luckily, having stayed at other hotel, we managed to figure things out.   Upon entering the room, to our horror, guess what we found in the mini fridge? A ‘naked’ instant noodle with sauce packets and disposable fork. There was also a yellowish ‘spill’. We called ‘0’ and the person on the line told us to throw it away ourselves and that sometimes, the mini fridge is ‘auto-locked’. Whatever that meant.   Nevertheless, this made me doubt if all the rooms is thoroughly cleaned and whether standards are compromised due to ‘fully booked’ status. Moreover, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. This has…', 'Beware. We received our keys at 5pm even though we were at the hotel at 2pm and requested early check in. They didn’t give a hoot about us when we explained we needed the room at check in time because we had a small child with us who needed to nap. In fact, the staff at the counter told me, “ Check in time at 3pm means check in FROM 3pm”', 'Went there for a staycation but end up getting really disappointed. The exterior of the hotel looks so beautiful but the interior is deteriorating so quickly. Upon entering the room, was greeted by a TV that doesn’t work and a really dirty notepad. The coffee and tea selection provided in the room is also disappointing, it is probably what a budget hotel would provide. Overall, definitely not worth price.', 'Efficient check-in service, fuse free!  Room is clean and minimalistic, love the woody, eco theme of the room. Storage space is well-placed and hidden from sight.  Rain shower water flow is just nice, not too weak. Bath tub only available in some rooms.  Location of the hotel is fantastic! Situated right in between Clark Quay and Chinatown, there is no lack of things to do and food to eat!  Hong Lim market and food is just right beside. Lots of famous and awesome food, can takeaway and bring back to hotel room to enjoy!  Pool has a nice view but water is cold cause there is no direct sunlight. This also means that you can save on your sun screen.   Fitness area is small but has dumbbells and some machines to get your essentials in.   Express check-out. Just pass the room card to…', 'Warmly greeted at the check in counter, fascinated by the hotel lobby. Stayed in lifestyle room, nice view with lots of greenery. Room is clean and cosy. Infinity pool and gym is great for a relaxing swim and well deserved work out. Hotel is conveniently located near shopping malls and MRT station.', 'The room was very spacious and comfortable. Loved the massage at the spa. Champagne breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails were wonderful too. The service staff were very friendly, especially Serene Teo, Twinkle and Min Lin. Will surely recommend this hotel to our friends. My husband and totally enjoyed our stay.    M/M R. Ang', 'Location is the best! Near to china town, clark quay and marina bay as well. Good place to stay-clean and nice room! Good food and accommodating staff from front desk,dining to security staff! And most especially to the housekeeping for maintaing the clean room all the time!', 'Bought the suite dreams come thru package which comprises of 2 pax, 1hr full body massage, lime buffet dinner, and free hotel transfer to and fro. Upon check in, we were told that we are also given the collection club lounge privilege which includes high tea, evening cocktail and breakfast. A shout out to Twinkle from the collection club lounge for her impeccable service. The hotel massage was superb too and room was very clean. Things to improve: - some gym equipment were rusty and old, the weights on one of the machines were  not even visible - buffet selection and quality seem to be lacking. Will not be willing to pay for it - service replies. Wrote in an email to amend my dinner booking date but did not receive a reply. Called the hot desk to amend the hotel transfer timing…', 'I have been in this Hotel for a few months. Fantastic staff. Hope to be back soon, very nice view room, club lounge and lime restaurant to try. Thanks to Dervyn, Serene, Chef Thye, Edmond, Sylvia, Claudia, Chin and all the staff. Great location, near to the center. To try  Thank you so much, see you soon.', 'Stayed for 2nights. Overall staff service was good, they were friendly as well. But one of my concerns is that the toilet does not have bidet shower. For those who are not used to just wiping off with tissue after toileting, it is very troublesome to go inside the shower cubicle and wash off using the shower spray.  Also only few choices for breakfast buffet. For me the price is still expensive for the worth of the accommodation.', '20 march 1.30pm  We had some issues with the facilities booking and tried to seek help at the front desk. However, it was the school holidays and the front counters were extremely understaffed. I tried approaching a lady on the furthest right counter (she’s sitting down and the counter says “discovery”) and she was extremely rude when i tried to explain my issue to her nicely. (I think she may be the senior in charge there as she was wearing a black formal jacket while everybody else were wearing a grey jacket) she stared us down and snapped at us unrelentingly. I gave up and decided to approach Ms Chin at another counter and reiterated my issues to her (in the exact manner as how i told the lady in the black jacket). Ms Chin’s attitude was completely different. She listened to…', 'Waited 2-3 hours at hotel lobby to get our rooms. No drinks or alternative was offered. Facility like the pool was fully booked.

We didn’t even scold her and we are just asking.   3) Staff Nigel at Lime restaurant was rude - while speaking to him, he keep looking at the computer and typing his stuff instead of focusing on our need - My husband and I asked about having dinner while waiting for our room but we were being rejected as restaurant was full  - We offered to wait but they say will not have a seat as there’s late night reservation too  4) Breakfast not confirmed even with…', '1) Reach the hotel around 2.30 PM, and we only manage to register for the check in at around 5pm plus.

Which means the room will be ready around 7 or 8pm? And we are simply brush off by the reason that this arise due to school holiday.  2) Issues with the condition of the bathroom’s drainage system. Was in extreme shock to see the water has overflow till the entrance area because the drainage is not in working condition.

Thank you to the team for working hard.    We love the  well appointed Lifestyle junior suite with its full length windows offering excellent views of the city.   We enjoyed the afternoon tea, evening drinks and canapes at the club lounge.  Pricier rooms yes, but feel that it\\'s worth it.  the pool was beautiful and the greenery very soothing.

And despite the COVID putting strains on manpower and etc., the food and drinks still maintain its standard, great as usual. And I wanted to specially extend my thank you to Serene from the Club Lounge team, who has been super friendly, helpful with excellent service on all the interactions.   Last but least, hotels have been hit the most in this current crisis. And to my knowledge many hotels have cut their headcount quite substantially. As a customer, let’s try to be more understanding for the stay. Together we can make it through. Don’t forget to put on a smile to the staff that rendered help to you :)', 'Nothing was explained. Most of the staff looked high and mighty. They don’t even bother telling you what to look out for like booking the pool or breakfast. Everything I knew was based on my research. When I asked for parking, the person gave me a smirk and said all hotels give complimentary parking. You could just say your hotel offers it instead of a rude comment that was unnecessary.', 'Poor service, poor management.   The service given by the GM is poor and non empathetic. He do not allow guest to 3pm giving reasons such as 200 rooms are not clean and not ready for guest. Most guests gotten their room after 6pm. As for me, I got mine at 6.45pm. There were no service recovery and they had no system in checking in or staggering time for guests.

We came by to your hotel at 145pm, do the registration and we were happy to be told that we will be getting room on the highest floor which is LVL 15 and upgraded to Lifestyle Room. We waited almost 1 hour for our room with no refreshments offered while waiting. Upon getting our key card, we were surprised that our room is on the 12th floor and it is based on our normal booking.

One room was complimentary as part of the Healthcare HERO program while we paid for an additional room.  My advise to families with young children  1. Avoid these rooms as they located along a narrow corridor with short metal poles along it (see photo). This can be dangerous for children who may try to climb over the poles.  2. The condition of room 915 was poor (see photo on bathtub and washbasin). The washbasin has multiple brownish stains and looks disgusting.

Even as club room guest or even with our membership level, we have to queue all the way to the back. there wasn’t a single dedicated check in for hotel higher status membership guests. This is definitely something that other hotels are doing better. I really hope the hotel management can do something about this. Even direct check in at club lounge will be good.

Front desk explained the benefits of the club booking but the staff missed out the tour bus ticket and welcome drink.  Room: Decent size, not huge but ok. Bathroom though small, is well-designed.

All served together and cold. Cocktail was good though took pretty long to serve.  Breakfast: Nothing much to shout about, at least the eggs and beehoon were served warm.

Food were of poor quality and does not justify the additional money for lounge access.  Champagne breakfast - It is now at the main Lime restaurant. There does not seem to be any separation or identification of any sort between collection guests vs other guests which makes it difficult for collection guests to be served champagne  promptly.

Check in was a bliss, though lobby is a little dated. Had a relaxing 2 hour slot at the pool.  Breakfast was ala-carte buffet, selection is slightly lesser but with good quality of food that makes up the selection. The staffs were very friendly and even pro-active customise the foods they serve per my boy's preference…\", \"Celebrated my son's birthday and staff were accomodating to help decorate the room with the balloons that we brought over. There was also a small slice of cake and some birthday items for the little boy. Got the family package with 2 rollaways and there is still ample space to move around.   Front office: check in was smooth with short waiting time. Friendly staff and we were shown to our suite by Midori.   F&B service staff: all of the staff were very attentive. Thanks to Kelly, Carien, Ganesan and Chloe who made our meals at Melt enjoyable. Breakfast selection was limited but lunch had a good variety.

Good service overall, excellent quick and efficient service at Melt during breakfast session. Excellent cocktails and food @ MOBAR, superb and attentive service too. Disappointed didnt get a table at Morton's for the Martini session.. should have make reservation a week before. Well organized pool area with excellent view of the bay. I can imagine the superb view from rooms with full bay view.  Will be back again if the price is right :)\", 'We stayed over the weekend of 5 March 2021 in a lovely room facing the  Marina Bay.

We were promptly seated by the service staff..( special mention to Ganesan who attentive to our needs and we had a lovely conversation with him which made our dinner awesome ) and not forgetting CK ( service staff who served us for breakfast - very pleasant staff who  made out experience awesome ) Looking forward to going back to the Mandarin Oriental. TR', \"Attended my brother wedding banquet. What more to say. Mandarin oriental have up hold their standard as always and show that they're the best out of all the hotels out here. I have stayed here once or twice but the banquet have just bring it to the next level. As the wedding banquet was just perfect, I believe the two manager on the ground Jason and Kang le was just too hands on. They assist the staff in every way and help them in the service flow. I believe that without them the wedding couldn't have been this beautiful. \", \"Our inaugural stay at Mandarin Oriental Singapore left a lasting impression. Hospitality was top-notch, from reservation to the actual 3D2N stay. The small touches like the birthday balloons with handwritten message and the room slippers for our daughter made the experience very personalised.  The team made us feel welcomed throughout our stay and really raised the benchmark of what Hotel standards should be, considering we've had staycations at 7 different local hotels. We look forward to returning and celebrating another memorable occasion.  Special mention, compliments and our utmost gratitude to the following staff:  1. Mr. Andrew - assisted us during check in by personally bringing us to our room, took our arrival family photo and turned it into a meaningful memento  2. Mr.…\", 'Amazing. Just amazing.

From the booking of room, early check-in invitation, delicious (huge square sized) birthday cake, to the in-room and The Melt café dining experience - everything was superb. Staff were very attentive and thoughtful, they were very detail-oriented. When I asked for 2 bottles of water from Housekeeping, they sent up 4 bottles. Not to forget, the gym has adequate resources despite closing many machines for safe distancing. The pool has great view too! I’ve had many staycation experiences. I can honestly say that this is one of the best staycay experiences in Singapore! My fiancé and I thoroughly enjoyed our hotel stay!

Out of all the hotels we’ve been to, this is the worst one of all. Prior to our stay, we’ve kept our expectation low after reading all the reviews.

We have tried calling the front desk a few times to request for water, soap, bath towel etc. It took us more than 10mins each time or even longer, that we have to go down all the way to the recep.

', 'Reception did not tell me much during check-in, until I asked for more information like breakfast locations, where do we go etc. I booked a club room, but the club lounge was closed, and club benefits minimal. The only difference between this and a normal room was that you could get an afternoon/evening set which included drinks and some food for an hour. Always seemed shorthanded, so service and food quality can be improved. In summary, expected more, but got a lot less. Dissapointing.', 'Despite some minor issues here and there, we had an amazing stay. One thing that was really impressive was that when they realized we had a baby, they brought in a clean baby bath tub and Philips Avent sterilizer as soon as we came into the room.

Nearby Raffles city mall and mrt station. Very accessible to go anywhere by train or bus. Room was beautiful and exactly the same in shown in pictures. We went during the school holiday so there were crowd waiting at arrival/check in area, waited an hour before we were given our keys to check in. Staff was really nice, friendly and pleasant, serve the kids biscuits and drinks. Overall i would still return back to this hotel.', 'Bed very comfortable. Very cosy. Though room not that sound proof. Overall, I had a wonder stay with my partner. The surroundings very accessible as well because there are Funan mall, Peninsula, Raffles city malls all around. There are convenient stalls around as well, easy to get cup noodles for suppers. It is very near the MRT station, just a feel stop away, can walk.', 'very cozy hotel room with utmost cleanliness and service. Though check in took a little longer than expected, guests were made to feel comfortable with refreshments and were allocated seats to wait while their rooms are cleaned up. Would come back again.', 'There were no toiletries in the bathroom. I tried to call the reception and housekeeping but no one answered. It was quite depressing to know that the reception is not answering calls. I had to go down to the reception personally 4 times to get my shampoo and body wash. They keep telling us they will inform the housekeeping but nobody came up till late evening after dinner.   I also requested for additional bed for my kid. I paid for it at the reception immediately after check in. But the bed also wasn’t set up till late night.', 'Located at city outskirt but with easily accesible transport to city, local food court.  The cleanliness and comfortness of the room and bed.  Breakfast was simple n very nice. Just add a little more options.  ', \"Had a very unpleasant stay at Grand Park City Hall. Will not recommend this hotel to anyone. Literally checked ourselves out early before 12 and couldn't wait to come home, which never happens on previous staycations or holidays. To be frank, our expectations were quite low to begin with as we have heard negative things about staycations in some hotels in recent months. We did not expect it to be so bad. We have stayed in hotels with less stars but this takes the cake!  CHECK-IN: What really bothered us was not so much the waiting times but the lukewarm customer service. Like most reviewers, there was an extremely long wait to check in. The entire lobby was overwhelmed with people and a disproportionate number of working staff. It was made worst by the poor attitudes of their…\", 'The best hotel room staycation. Hotel staffs & services are excellent & good hospitality. Everything was perfectly right. The room is so amazingly beautifully decorated. Will come back again for sure. ', 'strongly doubt that this is a 5 stars hotel. the hotel standard and service is extremely bad. there are no communication within staff / departments. totally regret booking this hotel right from the start.   1. had email the hotel immediately after i made the booking that i will be here for my anniversary stay for 3 days 2 nights and requested for early check-in. the reservation department took 3 days to give me an general reply and selective replying to my questions.   2. 1 day prior to my check-in, i received an email from the hotel requesting us to select our staggered check-in timing. however to my horror, the check-in process was ridiculous long. waited for 2 hours before i could get a room. by the time i get into my room, it was already 4pm. i do not understand why does the…', \"A memorable and enjoyable stay. Hata and the team made our stay special and i would be coming back for more. Good food around the hotel. its easy to travel and there's nothing else to say except to stay there again. Thank you!\", 'Check in process is too long, the bath room was not cleaned properly. The check in process is just endless and aimless waiting from one place to another. After check in, the bathroom marble top has a lot of stains not clean properly.... ', 'The location and car parking have save us lots. We can able to walk to places of interest without much issues. It’s and cosy hotel, authentic and value for money. Just work on your breakfast. Remove the salmon please the next round. ', 'Reach here at 340pm the queue outside is already ridiculous..... waited for 1.5hrs. I have to wait here from level 1 to level 3. I was given some form to check. The person came to collect and I asked how long more do I have to wait. She said I never submit........ you never tell me submit??!?!?!? How I know. Lousy experience. ', 'Checking in process was slow. One hour after check in starts yet the rooms were not ready and need to wait couple hours more. Lobby was hot as though air conditioning not working. Furnishings were old. Not worth the stay at all. Will not return and will not recommend to anyone else.', 'Room is nice and clean. Love the design and ambience of the room. Breakfast and hightea is good too! Service is great too and check in and check out is fast and easy. One thing is aircon temperature not cold enough other than that all is great!', 'We enjoyed our stay in your hotel. Birthday surrprise and honeymoon at your hotel was an enjoyable. Husband really happy to receive a slice of cake for his birthday as requested for his birthday. Honeymoon deco niceee 👍👍 Cool room, mostly touch screen to switch off the light and blind down the bind in the toilet ! So cool 🥰', \"Hotel room provided was nice. Location was is really good as well. Less than 10mins walk to either City hall or clarke quay. Late check out was provided upon requesting for it via email.   Overall experience was great. I'll definitely come back here again next time 👍\", \"Beautiful room and good location. My second visit here was dulled by the lack of bathrobes in the room and barely functional toilet. Most importantly, the front desk, reception and room service were not manned by the hotel when I requested for something. I've called around 5 times in an hour or so to no response. \", 'Hotel is clean, location and service is good. Introduced a few friends to the hotel for staycation too. My son enjoyed himself and we will definitely go for another night stay at Grand Park City Hall.', \"If you need to be in the City Hall area and don't want to pay up for the Raffles or Fairmont, and you equally don't want to slum it and some of the cheaper hotels, this is a very good mid-priced alternative.  Under S$200 for a perfectly acceptable 4* room.  Room was clean and a good size, everything worked, bed was comfortable.  Didn't try the pool or any of the F&B.  Service was fine throughout our stay.\", \"Beautiful hotel, great location. Never a dull day. Room was clean, we loved the bath tub. The pool at night was gorgeous. There's so much to see around and the hotel stay was great. Service was great from front desk to room service.\", 'Good location hotel. Booked it via klook because of value for money after using SRV. And we like the concept/interior design of the room.   But service can be better/improved as it is quite slow. Arrival area lack of manpower. It seems like there is only 1 person working. After waiting for a while, we were then told that there is another check-in counter at level 3 (if I’m not wrong). Upon check-in, my partner was telling the front office lady that the hotel feels quite warm (air con was not strong). Her reply was quite cold and said that because we came from outside and it takes time to cool down. But there is really a big difference from the hotel room and the lobby, lift area.  Service in the hotel is a little slow in terms of calling for housekeeping. Not too sure about…', 'Was an overall pleasant stay, we really love the ambience in the hotel even though the facade did not reflect this. We had a good swim in the pool and also had breakfast at the hotel. We also had a lot of fun with the advance tech in the hotel. Would definitely come again!', 'The bad: - Check-in experience was terrible. Be prepared to wait 1) outside the hotel entrance for at least 30 mins, 2) at the first floor lobby for 20 mins with almost nil air con and 3) at the third floor waiting rooms for another 10-15 mins. The most unpleasant part was the lack of aircon. Be prepared to just sweat it out.  - Checked into the room and was unable to set to a cooler temp despite adjusting the controls on the app panel. Called concierge/front desk and was told to troubleshoot on our own/give some time for the room to cool. After calling multiple times waiting for technician that never turned up the front desk finally came up to our room at 11+pm (because temp was still stuck at 25 degrees) and eventually informed us later that the aircon was indeed faulty before…', '1. Check is not proper. No signs boards to let us know where to go. Was quite confusing. No staff to tell us where is the direction. Everyone seem to ignore. We have to interrupt the staffs to ask. Directed to head to level 3, approach the receptionist and staffs did not seemed bothered. Had to ask if this is where we are supposed to check in.   2. Directed to a ‘run down office like’ waiting room with again no staff telling us what to do. Had to approach a male staff to ask if this is the correct area to check in. Directed to sit at table number 7. Staffs seemed to be all over the place as guests keeps coming in.   3. Male staff approach and ask for our IC. Did not even ask for our booking confirmation which was unusual.   4. Female staff approached 10 minutes later and  ask if…', \"The hotel interiors looked like a 5 star hotel!

Other than that, a pleasant stay with many food options nearby!\", \"We check in on fri and check out on sat. We expect it will be quite busy so had plan to book 12pm slot for check in. Our check in was smooth and luckily not crowded. Before hand i had downloaded the grand park city hall app. The app allows us to unlock the room and adjust the lighting, aircon and fan in the room. Wow cool right something new and we are amazed by it. Setting need to be done so front desk Mikaela helped us with it. We unlock the room using the app and went in. the room was spacious, airy, clean, nice deco and lightings. The toilet is see thru but there is adjustable electrical blind to protect privacy.

Amenities were nearby and food selections aplenty within foot walk. Had an excellent time with my partner and she enjoyed herself thoroughly!', 'A nice quiet and fully equipped hotel with all the latest smart hotel features. Believe the hotel was renovated but a few of the things which need to be fixed are the wifi which was not working even though calls were made to the reception. We could not log on on both mobile and laptop and it could not be rectified. The master switch is only on one side of the bed. For a twin sharing it would be better to have it on both sides as two friends may sleep at different times. The screen for the see through glass shower in the bathroom was a cool thing but will need maintenance. The staff were well trained and friendly, especially those we met. Room was very well equipped though the bed was something I had to get used to as the topper was too thick. Other than these, my main peeve was…', 'The rooms are beautifully decorated, easy access to rooms as well. However you could actually hear other guests walking and talking at the hallway.
