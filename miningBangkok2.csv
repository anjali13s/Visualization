However, it didn’t end there. I lost my mobile phone and everyone including the kind security checked the cctv helped me! I finally managed to retrieve my cell phone!I cannot Thank enough every staffs here in this Hotel for their patience, kindness and impeccable services from the Heart!

3,5.0,"== People ==This is my 5th Marriott hotels in Bangkok, which is great for the overall services.I have great impression while the arrival, bell boy is proactive, and front desk guided me to the R Bar for check in (Club Lounge is temporarily closed for renovation). The club team is very attentive, K Ploy gave us very warm welcoming and the nice room arrangement. The whole process is very smooth. I would like to thanks for the Club Manger K One and her team, they take care of the club guest well, and handled the incident with prompt action and properly.== Room ==Thanks to the Club team arrangement, we stay at a nice Studio Suite this time. The room with high ceiling, thus even it a bit aged, you still fell very specious. The bathroom is see through and with a big window, also feel comfortable while using the it.Housing keeping team did a great job to give us comfy room, the most touched thing is they provided the nice toothpaste for our long stay when we told them we don’t want to waste the toothbrush by just using the toothpaste attached. Only concern is the sofa by side of the window, the surface may need some retouch, suggest to make it wider while the renovation, then it can be a great day bed in the room. == Facility ==Great thing is the fitness open 24hours, good for me to do the cardio in the early morning. Swimming pool looks nice, but didn’t have chance to use this time.== F&B==One of the best breakfasts of the Marriott hotels in Bangkok, admire the wide variety of the food, as well as the pastry corner, almond and chocolate croissant are great, but egg stations’ quality seems not consistent.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
4,3.0,You gotta love the location of the hotel-in the middle of everywhere in BKK. Nice and comfy bed. The amenities are not bad but not my favourite-too faminine. Super slow food at R Bar. The aircon in male’s locker room definitely needs to be fixed/deep cleaned. ,Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
5,5.0,Great services as always. Breakfast especially cheese omelette by Chef Roong is the best. Khun June at Flavor always gives you morning smile. Service and Refreshment at the club lounge is quite good when not so crowded. Food and services at La Tavola and Feiya are great.

6,5.0,"I felt excited every time to come back to stay at this hotel as its exceptional friendly and nice staff made me feel welcome and special. It was just like I was back to meet old friends. One of the most enjoyable time while staying here was during the relaxing times in the lounge to enjoy great food & beverage, while chit chatting to staff. Apart from Kwan, Ploy, Aey, Chacha, Kevin, Chef Jack whom I was familiar with, this time I also met Khun Wan, the club lounge manager. She was so active and attentive to guests’ request that I had no surprise why the lounge staff were impressive. Although I had no chance to meet Min, who was able to please you with, not only the standard alcohol drinks, but also some special drinks from her mixing skill, her lively and smiling faces when she handed in her specially mixed drinks with proud remained in my mind. She even said that she would keep practicing her drink mixing skill more and more in order to make her guests smile with happiness. What a nice lady!On the checking-out day, I always think to myself that ‘wait for me and I will come back soon’.This property is highly recommended for travelers who looks for great place to stay in the centre of Bangkok with full of fantastic staff who is prompt to offer the second-to-none quality of services.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

8,3.0,"It’s my first time staying at this hotel. So I had a little expectation before going.The hotel is easy access from BTS Chidlom station with convenience stores nearby. Walking distance to Central World and Siam Paragon. My friend and I stayed at Deluxe room with club benefits from Marriott’s. Unfortunately club lounge on a high floor was temporarily closed for renovations so we spent time at ground floor bar instead. Luckily we still had some snacks to enjoy. The bed size is perfect and soft. The wild clear window can see througc bathroom is good for staying alone and couples lol. But the room was a little bit old for the electric stuffs, no USB and still need to use ight switch. Staffs are friendly and helpful but there were a traffic during snacks time at ground floor. The staffs were lack and seats were limited while guests were many. Breakfast was good. Restaurant staffs were friendly. It’s good that they serve orange juice with shot of espresso, well adjustment. Unfortunately I didn’t had a chance to try other restaurants in a hotel.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

10,5.0,"The promotional rate during Covid-19 was almost nothing so we didn't expect much at all. However, it turned out to be one of the best workation experiences. The check-in lady, Khun Dew, kindly upgraded the room the next day when it became available. We were greeted by first name with big smile by most staffs everywhere in the hotel. Our special thanks go to Khun One, Khun Kwan, and Khun Kevin who were always there especially around the club lounge. Khun One is highly professional, she manages the club lounge effectively with friendly vibes, making guests feel very much like home. Breakfast is one of the best in town. Loved the signature egg benedict with curry sauce. Must try! The afternoon tea and canapes times (rather think of it as late lunch and dinner), were always of high quality and tasty and it includes alcohol too! We also used the gym situated on high floor with the view of Bangkok skyline. I particularly like the pool because it is temperature controlled with heater. Will definitely return.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

12,5.0,Just got one comp night and chose to stay at this property for first time. The impression is staffs especially K. Tiffy and K.Ice at the front. My booked room type was unavailable as per previous guest's occupancy  when i arrived at 4.30 pm on 7th of feb but they upgraded me to 1515 with spacious area inside. Room cleanliness was top notch and bed was spotless. Love it! There were several kind staffs in lobby area but i dont know their name. There will be a second time of my visiting for sure.,Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

15,3.0,"This is my first time at Renaissance Hotel, Bangkok. I stayed there for 2 nights on 22nd floor. The room faces Central Word department store. The location is very close to sky train. Very convenient. Room: The decoration is nice, particularly the glasses which neatly used. The bed is amazing is very pleasant. The desk is also nice. The television is good. There are many channels. The toilet is beautiful. There is also a bidet shower next to the toilet. The bathtub is big and beautiful. It’s really photogenic. The amenities are good, nice smell. I really like the body lotion. There is an iron in the room as well. Well-equipped. Comfortable.Food: Delicious. Wide range of choices. Good quality.Service: Bell boy, and front desk boy are good. Housemaid are friendly. They gave me a very good impression. Very polite.Lounge: I went to check in on 21st floor at club lounge with a female staff. She did not greet me as a Marriott member. From my experience, when I check in any Marriott hotel, they generally greeted me by welcoming me back again. So, when she did not greet me like that, I was surprise; but that is fine, maybe she forgot. When I informed her about my booking, she looked nervous. From my experience, she did not perform a professional gesture at the check in desk. I did not tell me which room I was about to stay. When she finished the check in procedure, she did not inform me as well. So actually, from my experience, I expected more. I think this check in experience was not professional and unimpressive, particularly when compare to another Marriott hotel which I have stayed.At the lounge, on the day that I visited, there was a lot of people. I waited for quite a long time to get food. So I did not go back on the next day, because eating somewhere else was more convenient.Overall: Everything good, except the lounge.  ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
16,5.0,"The only hotel I been to that has a heated pool in Bangkok. Why would you need a heated pool in tropical Bangkok one wonders? The fact is there are indeed short sporadic periods of cold spells from November to January. This period, it went as low as 15 Celsius in my car’s thermometer on some mornings. For tropical folks here, jumping into a swimming pool in the cool season will throw many into hypothermia. So, when the pool is heated to a balmy 29 Celsius (as seen on my Garmin), it was indeed pleasant. As I swam over the water circulation outlets, it was like encountering those heated volcanic vents in the deep cold sea. The pool here is open air, but indoors in the shades. Lately, there has been a wave of Covid in Bangkok, strict measures are back in place again. To get access to the pool, we had to make advance bookings. Each booking is limited to 30 minutes. During that half hour, we had the whole pool to ourselves. Although this sounded restrictive, which it is, the experience was exquisite. Especially when you have children that are like 60,000W loudspeakers generating white noise, you do not really have to be concern about it as there are no one else around that could feel irritated. I loved the pool. It was like our personal family bathtub, minus the soap and bubbles of course.  The room we had was a one-bedroom studio suite. There are 4 on the corners of the floor we were on. Our room has generous windows across 270 degrees and that extended into the bathroom where a standing tub stood. A sturdy wall desk next to the large flatscreen, it was space slightly tight for some work I had to do. Natural light irradiated throughout the room, and the view of the urban scape was splendid. As the skies dusk, the spectrum of sunset tones painted our room. A sofa along one side, that was where I lazed relaxed and sipped coffee while watching the afternoon skies. Right beside this corner, a traditional set of gongs erected vertically on a stand. That was where I made loud chimes that did no rhymes, and probably irritating the rooms adjacent. The sound insulation between our room and the next 1726 was rather disappointing. No staff policed the floors on this Saturday night. The next room sounded like they had 20 people compacted in there to make the best out of the weekend room thay paid for. They were yakking loud, there was high pitch witchy laughter and there was constant slamming of the door as people went in and out of the party room. That really devastated my sleep. Fortunately, my child was able to sleep through all these. I only managed to get some shut eye after 1 am.  The executive lounge is located on a high floor. During cocktail hours, the place was entirely filled. This season, everywhere in Bangkok, everyone is a privilege guest with lounge access. And so, this is where we all turned cocktail canapes hour into a dinner meal. I love the way Renaissance practiced Covid measures here. We were not allowed to self-serve at the buffet line. But with the house being full, we had to wait long for our orders to be taken and waited equally long for the staffs to bring our food from the line. Children were at the verge of throwing tantrums. There was salad, there was karaage chicken for the children. There was the delicious panang pork curry and traditional rice crackers with meat sauce topping (except they kept forgetting to bring me the meat sauce). And then there was more. We really did not need dinner after that. Breakfast was an enjoyable feast as well. Except they were trying to freeze us to death. My congee turned into ice block, my pancakes turned into flying saucers. My child was unusually quite due to low body temperature and returned to live when I gave her hot food. Just kidding…  but it was cold. Breakfast spread featured local morning delicacies you find in markets. Moo ping (BBQ pork on sticks) was excellently tender and tasty. It was accompanied by sticky rice. There was kai yang kao niao (BBQ chicken, again with sticky rice), and there was also the traditional soy milk with dough fritters. It was local through and though. Some like it this way, bring the market in clean without walking the alleyways. Other then local, there was sushi, really delicious dim sum and all the other western spreads. They even had pulled-pork sandwich. I have always been impressed by the wide range in a Marriott buffet, but here at Renaissance, it was equally impressive. It did get quite crowded as 9 am drew near, so be early or be queued on weekends. We ate and ate, we did not need to have lunch, for the next 3 days.    Renaissance is located away from the main road. Seven Eleven will be a short stroll under the walkway of a shopping complex that has got a good sports factory outlet. On the main road up the stairs to the elevated walkway, you can easily reach Central World, the BTS and everything else. Convenience and access to everything are just short walks away. Outdoor areas for chilling out is limited in this hotel. Down the lobby, there are some chairs by the driveway, but that is the smoking area. The other outdoor space one could spend some time lazed on a chair to read a book is where the swimming pool is. And then there is the roof top bar, which is for drinks in the night, and was closed because of Covid. Any conducive space to do some notebook related work? No, there is none if outdoor one seeks. So, our room will have to be the work room, but with noisy child my concentration collapsed. There is a meeting room where the executive lounge is, but I would prefer sitting outdoors on a cool morning. All in all, my stay was fulfilling and fantastic, except for the noisy night. What was most unique and what I loved most, the heated pool. This shall be my return destination in the cooler months of Bangkok. And there are still some last chances of cold spells in Jan 2021 for the personal bathtub experience.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

19,5.0,"Staying at the Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel for 5 consecutive nights, we had so many great experiences there. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Bangkok. There are plenty of shopping malls nearby such as the Central World; where my wife went for her figure skate practice almost everyday and the Gaysorn Village is less than 5-min walk. And, the hotel is connected to the BTS Chitlom station via the Maneeya building on the 3rd floor. There are not so many guests during our stay so the hotel's quite peaceful and private. The 25 meter city-view indoor pool is a must to try. The fitness center is fully equipped with treadmills machines, and free weights, very impressive. We would recommend the La Tavola italian restaurant for dinner, the Parma ham pizza and their signature Tiramisu are mouth watering. Also, the famous Feiya chinese restaurant is always the best in Bangkok. Please try Peking duck and Dim Sum for lunch. Furthermore, we loved the wagyu beef burger atthe R Bar, so very yummy. We got upgraded to the Renaissance Suite room which is huge, beautifully decorated, and the bed and pillows are very comfy. We enjoyed the large sized bathroom, bathub with million dollar view. All the staff gave us a very warm welcome and best service since check-in; from Bellperson to Front desk. Moreover, we'd like to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to Khun Cyndy, Khun Tuk, and Khun David for their kind assistance reserving and upgrading the room, and making sure that everything's alright for us during our 5-night stays at the hotel, especially the lovely yummy cake for us, we appreciate your thoughtfulness.

20,4.0,"Currently, the hotel offers some of the best deals in a town, so that’s why we are here. The room we stayed was nice, quite big, with a large and wonderful bathroom. We didn’t went for the club room in the first place but then we decided to go for the Happy Hour (just a little additional price) and I have to say it was beyond our expectation. The food was even better than some other hotel’s lounge in a normal situation but the drinks may be so-so, but hey for this kind of price and situation it’s the best. For the breakfast, it seemed like the breakfast is served in the lounge in weekdays. There was something I would say “limited” about the food lineup but the taste was good. Pool area was fine. The services were nice. ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Furthermore, with special promotions now being offered, there's no better time to spend a few days living in the lap of luxury.Renowned for its delectable cuisine, outstanding spa and vibrantly artistic decor, Renaissance Bangkok offers guests a choice of 11 different room and suite accommodations. From the plush Executive Suite to the standard Deluxe room, each is filled with world class amenities, stunning decor and outstanding furniture; the beds are super comfortable too.The lower floors of the hotel are primarily reserved for food, function and fun areas. R Bar, for example, is a wonderful place to hang out enjoying your favourite cocktail, an ice cold beer or a straight up Americano coffee. The lobby is an artist's dream with hidden motifs, flowery symbols and a grand glass stairway. Hidden behind doors is the car lift, which rumour has it can be reserved for private dinners!Also located here are fine dining restaurants La Tavola, Fei Ya and Flavors, which shares the floor with the amazingly high-tech ballroom. La Tavola is one of the city's top Italian restaurants, while Fei Ya without a doubt cooks up the best Cantonese food, including its amazing Peking Duck, outside Hong Kong. Flavors, on the other hand, serves a fabulous international breakfast and at weekends is home to probably the best Sunday Brunch.The upper floors are where guests can indulge in a little R & R, with Quan Spa providing a unique array of treatments, the welcoming lap pool and sun loungers (in fact the pool is indoors so no chance of sunburn), while the exclusive Club Lounge is an oasis of calm.With easy access to Bangkok’s skytrain system, guests can enjoy shopping, cultural or sightseeing tours across the entire city. The skytrain interconnects with the city's subway system as well as riverboat services along the Chao Phraya River.

Why?Lobby: Nice and welcoming atmosphere with fresh and beautiful scent. Room: A bit old but comfortable and well-equipped with necessary amenitiesFood: No bad-taste food or not fresh food to think of Club Lounge: Good View with privacy atmosphereEverything seems to be right here for our family, but the most impressive thing to us is the STAFF from Front Door, Concierge, Club Lounge, Restaurant, Housekeeping, Pool & Fitness etc. Everyone we met are very energetic with, from my feeling, genuine service-mind. They are well-trained, nice, cheerful and helpful.Although I cannot name everyone here, but there must be some staff who I would like to give special thanks and let them know that they are recognized by their service mind skills. Khun Kevin (Concierge Navigator): He always has a big smile on his face with his good memory about the hotel's return guests, especially what they like or don't like. This definitely makes us feel like coming back to our 2nd home to meet friends. He also has a remarkable ability to make us so tasty cocktails that we forgot to count how many drinks we have had. Chef Jack: I am sure he is one of the key persons who makes the hotel’s restaurants well-known for their tasty fine-dining and services. He is outstanding from the cloud in terms of making you become a special guest by offering special things through his culinary expertise. Front and Club Lounge staff: Khun Dew, Khun Nan, Khun David, Khun Tiffy, Khun Kwan, Khun Aeh, Khun Yo as well as Khun Cindy (RSVN) – you are all a legend of our hotel experiences.

30,5.0,"The Renaissance Hotel is in the center of Bangkok's shopping area, called Ratchaprasong.  The hotel is new, clean and has a refreshing look.  It is also close to BTS skytrain which passes by in front of the hotel.  We visited October 13-15 and as Titanium Elite was upgraded to a club suite.  When entering the lobby, you are greeted by a huge area, gift shop, bar and restaurant in addition to the front desk and comfortable sitting area with plants, flowers and water fountain.   Mention you are a club member and they will escort you to the club floor for check in.  If not, the front desk is staffed by friendly, cordial team members.  All the hotel staff we came in contact with from front desk, club lounge, security, housekeeping, etc. were helpful and attentive.  Our room was spacious with king bed, desk, sofa, easy chairs and a huge bathroom with walk in shower and all the amenities.  Bedding was immaculate and fresh.  The club lounge offered breakfast, tea time and cocktail and snacks, which were more than ample.  Staff were great.  Also in the hotel is an Italian Restaurant, (closed Mondays) and a Chinese restaurant, in addition to all day buffet style dining.  The fitness area offers a swimming pool which is open till late, as well as the gym also open till late.  No bakery on site.  Although Elite members get discounts on dining, during the special promotions with daily credits, they do not discount any further than the amount they are offering, so if 500 baht daily credit, you can use that at your discretion but they will not add on another 20-30 % discount.  Logical.  All the areas of the hotel we visited, were spotless.  It is wheelchair accessible with elevators and level areas throughout.

I thinkfine, everything sucks but we have our suite room to go! so we open up our room and we are shocked, It’s executive room which have the same size as normal.we no longer want to make complain or anything, It’s really a bad day, my kids want to swim so we go off swimming, the pool is great, probably the best thing in this hotel.and the we comeback and turn the aircon off as It’s cold for kids(which turn out to be a terrible action). after we are done we turn zircon on, put on our cloth and decided to go to sleep(around 10pm) but the problem is the aircon doesn’t even works, It’s very hot at the 20 degree, we can barely breath.we then called front desk to send mechanic up to fix it, he said everything is normal, normal? really?I asked him that can he swear that this is 20 degree, can he breath(I even left my sandle to hold the door open so I can let some air in) he speak sarcastically “do you want it to be colder, just say it” and ofcouse I want it to be colder, after an hour everything is fix(11pm) and we go to sleepfront desk call us at 11:30pm probably to ask if everything is fix yet but It’s 11:30pm and my children are sleeping so I hang up and took off the phone.in the morning we found letter saying that they are sorry for the air-con problem, no need to say sorry if you don’t mean it, I tear it up and throw away it trash.breakfast was fine but we made an order for some thai food but they forgot to make it and we have to keep asking for it.when we check out, me and my wife ask front desk to cancel all of our reservation, so this is our 1 night stay, if you are going to stay here, I wish you luck, may the force be with you",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

33,5.0,"I've been doing a several months of Work From Hotel, and this has my favorite place in Bangkok. The hotel has one of the best location with easy access to BTS Chidlom, and short walk from Siam / Ratchadamri. Easy access to thousands of restaurant options. The front desk, housekeeper, and bell staffs were very nice. As a titanium member, they tried their best to upgrade me to the studio suite. The room offers great layout, fresh and very well decorated. I’d say the room is on par with Intercontinental, and significantly better than the dated Hyatt Erawan / JW Marriott. The executive lounge offered an okay food and drinks selection, but could get a bit crowded over the weekend.One downside would be the small pool area, no poolside services, and lacking hot bath or jacuzzi (neither in the spa). In hotel dining is also a bit limited, with Fei Ya’s pecking duck being the only standout option.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for a stay in Bangkok.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

43,5.0,"We stayed her for 2 days before our return to New York.  Our Chief Navigator Amarin was so hospitable. We have stayed in other areas at Marriott properties. So he was very instrumental in explaining all the area to us. The Breakfast Buffet which we obtained as a package when we checked in was truly a treat. Again love the idea of ordering you egg/waffle/pancake options and instead of waiting for completion the Chef or runner brings it to your table.. A special shout out to Reena.(does she ever go home? Always pleasant and accomodating). She recommended a delicious restaurant NARA just steps from the hotel. Had we not had her expert guidance we would have missed this gem. I was fortunate to meet the Food and Beverage Director also. He was busy perusing the Breakfast flow and communicating with the Chef. So Mr.Winfried Sanders kudos for your guidance and intuitive outreach. (He actually went to every seated table and personally greeted each guest. Asked if there were anything else they would need. This to me being in the hospitality service industry myself would fit the bill of what Danny Meyer calls. ""Enlightened Hospitality""). I inquired if I could possibly take a Coffee American to go. And in 1 minute the coffee was delivered to my table. I look for every nuance of poor service when I travel. There was nothing I could find at this property with regards to that matter. And trust me I looked. To all the staff and housekeeping thank you. We will definitely be back again. ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Similar to other cities, Bangkok is also relatively quiet because of the virus. It just took us less than half an hour from airport to hotel, amazing.The moment we entered the hotel, we felt the hospitality. The check in was fast & we were served with a cold welcome drink.  The check in staff, named Bay & her working partner are both informative & helpful.This is my fourth visit to the hotel because of it’s convenient location ( very near to BTS & nearby shopping  malls), excellent breakfast & service. Maybe as there are not too many guests, we are also allowed to have late check out until 1600 hrs.Very enjoyable holiday, will definitely come again to this hotel.Vivian",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Spa was nice and good, since there’s good promotion now! Pool is indoor though, so it’s a little too cold for us! We had daily breakfast and I love the fresh fruit juice counter, but having to stay for 4 days straight, we got a little bored with the food option, so maybe the chef can have alternate day change of food menu? We also ordered room service and the pasta carbonara tasted really delicious.

56,5.0,"Just returned from Bangkok where I stayed at several places including a Hyatt, Four Points and Renaissance. All fine hotels but the Renaissance was, as always, fantastic. Starting with a smooth check in process and recognition of my Platinum status with a nice room upgrade. Khathy and Little (their nicknames) clearly explained that the Executive Lounge is under renovation and indicated where its services where being provided instead. My room was perfect as always with a very inviting bed and ample bathroom space. Super clean!After hitting the fitness room, headed to the Tavola where they would be serving evening canapés and drinks. Was helped in by Dew who is an outstanding hostess and indicated the temporary arrangements. The Tavola is the Italian restaurant which is also serving as Executive Lounge. Helping guests are the same staff as in the regular lounge making it an almost seamless transition. I have to recognize the gracious help provided in the lounge by Dew and Min, who have a great attitude doing their jobs. Min was fantastic about recommending canapés and providing my favorite drinks. Dew was great at making me del at ease in the new location.Overall I love this hotel, for its facilities, location and most importantly for the superb staff.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
57,5.0,"We visited for one night during our time in Bangkok to celebrate our anniversary. After some digging online, I was able to find an email address to send a request prior to arrival. My email was swiftly responded to by Miss Jidapha, an R Ambassador, and I felt assured that we would be well taken care of. I was particularly impressed with Aggie at the concierge desk. We had sent another email prior to arrival with a request for recommendations of a nice restaurant for our anniversary dinner. He made our reservation and when we went to the valet stand to request a cab, Aggie asked where we were going and immediately recognized us by our booking and greeted us by name. We saw him again the next morning and he asked how our dinner was. This was a great show of customer service and guest recognition, thank you Aggie! Based on the level of service we received from staff across the board, I was disappointed when I made some housekeeping requests via the Bonvoy app (there was a button that appeared after check in to make requests). Unfortunately we never received the items that I had requested until we made a call to the front desk. I had no problem calling the desk, however if you offer a service to make requests through the app it should be more closely monitored. Also, the chat function did not work either. Minor inconveniences, but worth a mention to look into! *i should  note our requests prior to arrival were completed in advance, these were made after check in*We reserved a club level studio suite, and while the Club Lounge was closed for renovations we were taken care of for evening service in one of their restaurants. The food was tasty, but we were particularly impressed with the tuna tartare and the specialty Thai whisky cocktails. Breakfast was included in our stay and was easily the most impressive breakfast buffet spread I have ever seen. Anything you could possibly imagine — they had it. Thai, Indian, Japanese, western... I could go on and on. Even if breakfast is not included in your stay, do not miss it. Our room was beautiful, and they decorated it for us for our anniversary — so cute! I left a separate, more complete review of the spa however we were a bit disappointed with the Thai massage. While it was a nice experience, it was not a traditional Thai massage which I have had previously. Overall, we had a wonderful (albeit short) stay. I would definitely return on a future trip to Thailand! ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Room having most of the necessary items but lack of the shaver which I could have request for.  The gym was OK but unable to find the floor mat for abs exercise and also no area for user to really work on abs.  Overall still a good gym.  Pool is quite good as shelter and offers good view. Club lounge, staff is OK BUT the food is fantastic. There are both Thai and western choice for breakfast and cocktail. What I really like is that the chef maintains the authenical taste of spice and taste of Thai food. Location is near to BTS, all shopping malls within walking distance and erawan shrine Is just 3 mins walk away.  Overall Renaissance maintains Marriott standard.  What I dislike... The card access for the lift and to the club lounge. At times after inserting numerous times in the lift.  you will be worried that you will miss your floor as the button will just not light up.  To the club lounge, will tends to miss the slot as corridor is rather dim.  The access card is black  in color makes the whole situation worst as unable to see the direction for insert.

81,5.0,"I have been visiting Bangkok for almost 20 years, but this was my first stay at the Renaissance Ratchaprasong.  Part of the reason for only just discovering the Renaissance is because I also lived in Bangkok for three years and stayed with friends after having moved away.  I know Bangkok well and have stayed at some of the best 5 star hotels in the city.  I can honestly say though the Renaissance is now at the top of this list.  As a Marriott Titanium Elite member, my choices for this trip were any one of the wonderful Marriott brands in Bangkok.  While I’m sure all offer similar comforts like the Renaissance, they cannot match its amazing location.  The Sukhumvit Chit Lom sky train stop is right outside the hotel’s door.  Given the fact that Bangkok ranks #11 as one of the world’s worst traffic cities, this is a HUGE plus.  If you want to go to the Chatachuk weekend market, the Sukhumvit line will get you there without even changing trains. A short walk away is also the Ratchadamri sky train stop on the Silom line which goes to the Chao Praya riverfront (Saphan Taksin stop) with access to Bangkok’s wats and temples via ferry and the Silom and Patpong night markets.  Also, some of the city’s best malls are within an easy 5 to 15 minute walk from the Renaissance - Siam Paragon, Central World, Gaysorn, Central Embassy, Amarin and the fabulous Cental Department Store.  Most offer first-class restaurants and incredible “food courts” with affordable and delicious international dishes and amazing shopping.One of the best parts of the Renaissance’s location is its proximity to Bangkok’s delightful Lumphini Park.  If you love to run or want to have an enjoyable walk after an early dinner, this is a must on your to-do list.  There are free outdoor aerobic classes, outdoor gyms, boat rides and occasional concerts.  It’s also the best people-watching around.  The park is completely safe even at night and is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel.  The Renaissance also has the best club lounge I’ve ever been to.  I watched as the lounge’s manager made sure that every possible comfort was afforded its guests.  The lounge offers breakfast, high tea and an incredible happy hour with a full range of appetizers and complimentary beer, wine and cocktails.  The service is impeccable.  If you’re looking for a wonderful, friendly Bangkok hotel that has it all, the Renaissance is it.  The rooms are well-appointed and spotlessly clean.

84,4.0,"This is a good location for shops, Sky train and central Bangkok. Rooms are a reasonable size with nice ensuite. Amenities in the room were not consistent each day. For example there was no body lotion for 2 days. We only had nuts etc on one of the turn down services. My only real reason for not giving this hotel five stars is that we had awful night sleeps. The bed is not very comfortable and the sound proofing between the rooms is non existent. We heard people talking at 1 am ,5 am and were woken by doors opening and shutting. We could hear people talking clearly in the early hours of the morning.On the plus side we had lounge access which was very good. Breakfast was enough and had a fresh egg station as well as local and western offerings. There is afternoon tea and 3 hours of wine, cocktails and also food for half an hour less in the early evening. The selection of food changed every day and was good. Lovely staff who were very helpful.Although we didn't try the indoor pool it did look nice. We did try the gym which has a reasonable range of equipment for a hotel but it was hot. The thermostats set at 24C! ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

86,5.0,"Very nice hotel hidden within downtown busy district of Ratchaprasong. Ideally you do not get hustle or bustle of the busy roads and activity around Ratchaprasong junction as it is hidden like 400m inside. The hotel only requires a 4mins walk to nearby Gaysorn or 6 Mins to BIG C or Central World.The staff were super nice people, they helped to change me some small notes which works both way for us both. I recall a lady when I was checking in, I cannot figure out how much coins worth is there and I thnk there was a slight shortage and she just gave me a new 20baht note in exchange, very good gesture.Service is top notch, the moment you call for them for supplies or cleaning etc they responds immediately. You know sometimes even their sister hotel JW Marriott would have issues with operator picking up, they would pick up almost immediatelyWe used their gym and pool facility, would say they are more than adequate and not very crowded. Some food market event was held throughout the weekends evening at the hotel carpark compound when we were there, they comprise of all the hotels associated to the Marriott group hawking their best foods as street food for sale, we tried some of the stalls absolutely marvellous.Nothing to be faulted, would love to live there again next time. Hopefully try their famous brunch on Sundays too.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
87,5.0,"First time visit to Bangkok.  No city I’ve been in of this size seemed quite so chaotic. 5 minutes of watching traffic, including drivers ignoring lane markers, multiple lane changes for no apparent reason, and those motorbike drivers who seem to think city streets are for motocross, and we decided to let others get us around.  Fortunately, the navigator staff at the hotel was up to the challenge.  They found just the right tours for what we wanted to do, each with hotel pickup and drop off.  Yes, BTS station is “right here” but it doesn’t serve enough areas (compared to say, Tokyo).  To each their own.Hotel accommodations were superb; we were provided a small suite upon arrival (at 2 in the morning).  Bonvoy Titanium status does afford some benefits.  Corner room, large bath, king bed. Only drawback would be building right next door (behind our always-closed bathroom shade).  It’s a bit disquieting “sitting” in the room and having some office person working at exactly room level in space that seems to be 10 feet away!!That, fortunately, was our only downside.  We ate our breakfasts in Flavors rather than the club lounge.  I have enjoyed many fine buffets within the Marriott family (Singapore, Yokohama, Dubai and Budapest come to mind) and Flavors is as good as any of them.  If you can’t find something you will enjoy eating in Flavors, we’ll, you must not be hungry!Other reviewers mentioned how wonderful the staff here is.  I concur.  I found myself wishing I carted around pen and paper to note all of their names.  Alas, that would be a daunting task.  Front desk, housekeeping, greeters, bartenders and wait staff, it doesn’t matter.  Everyone made us feel welcome anywhere we went.  It’s a credit to management, yes. But it is also a credit to each and every staff member that embodies what JW Marriott said so often: take care of the customer and the rest will take care of itself.  I teach collegiate organizational behavior and use that often with my students. My sincere gratitude to each of you that I encountered.Finally, since it was the club lounge staff I engaged with most often, I want to say a special ‘thank you’ to those of you whose name I do know.  Dew (no pun intended), Little, and One: you made our time here feel like we were home (when , in fact, we were 9,000 miles from our home.  I will say it this way: thank you for sharing your home with us.  A number of you stated that you hoped we will return.  I don’t know about that, but I sure feel I’d be welcome if we do.Please consider staying at this hotel if your travels bring you to Bangkok.  I think you will likely experience things as we did.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Breakfasts in the executive lounge were excellent. The daytime hostess, whose name I unfortunately didn't get was a joy to talk with. Not cheap, but if you can afford it highly recommended. If Bangkok wasn't so blessed hot I'd want to retire there and live in that hotel. ",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5
90,2.0,"I really wish this review could be a higher star review as I have stayed at this hotel many times over the few years it has been OK in the past but it's been consistently worse. Years ago when this was Starwood times were good but unfortunately status and being loyal to the property is barely even recognised anymore.I am a top tier member the Marriott program and I can say I have been fully #Bonvoyed this time. Don't get me wrong, the line staff at the hotel are very kind and do their best with their stretched limited resources, you can tell all the staff are very tired and overworked but keep a smile on their face.  The Thai people are very kind and will always help you when they can.Small things like a welcome card in the room are gone for people that spend 75+ nights with the brand. When it was SPG there used to be great amenities and welcome back gifts that cost the hotel nothing more than $5 each but meant a lot.  There isn't even fruit in the room anymore which is a common thing for even 3 star hotels in Thailand.I checked in past 3PM the normal check in time and long story short finally got into the room at around 9PM on the day of arrival. (Blamed it on a late check out guest) On that day I got a quick sorry and a few more excuses on why the room wasn't ready.  This was the most shocking part of the stay of which I am still upset about after traveling for for a day and half to get there and not getting a room on the guaranteed time.Note: There are not any traditional suites at this property except maybe the Presidential. They market a few of their upper rooms as suites, but are just basically slightly larger rooms at a much higher cost and really odd layouts. Literally they are just a slightly bigger space, no additional door separating the rooms, no additional powder room, dining space etc. If you need a real suite I would highly recommend other properties, all ""suites"" also only have a king bed so if you book 2 beds there are zero upgrades at the property. Note, if you do book a ""suite"" none of the curtains are truly black out, light will shine through the sides on all windows.I had issues with my key three times during my stay and was given different reasons each time I asked, but in the end it had to do with their vendors.  Also to note, there is zero ventilation in any of the bathrooms (no matter the room type) the bathrooms are very nice in size but they get very hot if the door is closed to the bathroom and or if someone leaves their scent it stays forever.Overall, the hotel is central there is no doubt about it but it is tucked a bit away from the BTS which is maybe a 5-10 min walk. It could be a really great hotel, the exec lounge is good but nothing I would pay for. During the breakfast they ran out of certain items as simple as coconuts which is a staple there.This property would really feel ideal only for business travelers staying a few nights The Internet cuts out everywhere you go and you have to sign on in different locations such as the lobby, room, lounge, gym etc. watch your roaming plans if you have one because the Internet can randomly stop if you don't log on.Overall, the hotel has potential it certainly does.  They keep it very clean and for its age it does keep well, but there are definite upgrades that could help the hotel. The line staff are very nice, but this is common throughout Thailand - the local people are hardworking and kind.",Renaissance Bangkok Ratchaprasong Hotel,4.5

Check in was a hassle-free feeling where I contacted hotel an hour prior via FB messenger telling I was about to arrive at 1.30pm.

They explained even clearly in details that my room would be ready however an additional request I made at short notice might not be ready. There was no problem for me at all.I arrived at the hotel by driving and this hotel provided a convenient car parking space where I just hopped from where I parked to the elevator which connected me right to the lobby reception. With luggage I had, I did not have any difficulty at all.I was revived warmly at the reception by Montana and Varaporn who kindly assisted in completing the registration so swiftly. I was escorted and informed clearly regarding hotel products and services - even how often they serviced the hotel shuttle boat to the prime riverside spot!I was so grateful for the hotel management’s kind consideration for allocating the most stunning view room for my special occasion stay️. The suite was so spacious, tidy and homey feeling. I have to spatially thank Kuakul from Housekeeping who made her kindest effort to decorate my sleeping bed so exquisitely.The overall room facility was all my need for a night stay. The spacious balcony made me a full rest for a day even I spent more time out there than inside. One thing I personally like to suggest is that it would be so good to have a water hose installed at the toilet.The facilities in and around the hotel were just perfectly convenient. There was a 7-eleven convention store located just in the same vicinity. There was also a beautiful small garden right from the main entrance to the riverside pier where the hotel shuttle boat service was on standby every 30 minutes for departing to main Saphan Thaksin pier.I was also thankful Chalida who checked me out of the hotel who provided the hospitable service with her lovely smile.

In overall, we are satisfied with the room facilities. However, we would like to suggest improving parking areas, it has unpleasant musty smell.",Chatrium Hotel Riverside Bangkok,4.5

My family pigged out on an English, then vindaloos, then salami salad, with capers and fresh walnuts.  Assorted Thai dishes were obviously available too.  Sided with this was an assortment of fresh bread, washed down with strong, freshly brewed coffee.The infinity pool on the 6th. floor is what you would expect.

We checked-in around 4:00pm and they gave us 2 rooms first saying that the other 3 rooms were not ready yet because we want rooms on the same floor (isn't it obvious that all bookings were named after 1 person and there's a high probability that we would need rooms on the same floor?), we turned a blind eye on that because we want to have a swim first.The next day we swam again after breakfast-- Breakfast was decent with very attentive staff specially Ms. Angie. When we came back around 12:20pm while at shower the phone kept ringing. Then my friends from the other room said that the receptionist called telling that we should checkout. My friend said that we requested a late checkout when we checked in, then the receptionist said that they will only allow 2 rooms. We were like ""what happened?""-- then we  moved to the 2 rooms hurriedly while my other friends just came out from shower. How does endorsement run in their Front Office? If they really need the room I would understand, given that they should've informed a night before or even hours ahead (this decision making is a matter of commonsense).When we checked out we were the one who said thank you upon leaving the lobby door. I don't know if they are too busy, feel guilty of what they did, or they were just pissed off that we didn't post yet the TripAdvisor that they are soliciting to post when we checked-in in return for the late checkout.","The Quarter Phromphong By UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

They are perhaps the sweetest, yet most invisible people in the entire hotel. However, I deeply appreciate and acknowledge their presence. At FNB, there is a young gentleman who is always cheery and has a memorable hair style. There is another host who stoically yet efficiently runs the floor - always offering bacon or omelette. The lady also is all smiles during breakfast.The trifecta of front desk ladies: the assistant manager, the courteous Filipina, and Beam all seem to effortlessly charm the guests, including myself. Business is indeed sweet as usual. The bellboys are good. Ma and the other gentlemen are professional and always prioritize guest satisfaction - a strong addition to the team. The security team also deserve a mention as their responsibilities are truly challenging, yet they still miraculously manage a smile.For the night shift, Sky and Mickey are nice and fun. Yet perhaps due to odd hours or inexperience they drop the ball on service once in a while but definitely make up for it and more at other times. Consistency of service would translate into leaps and bounds towards improvement.My hat tip to Khun Ohm for leading the team thru example at such a high level, I truly understand as I myself am also a leader behind an amazing team. I look forward to an even more pleasant stay at The Quarter.","The Quarter Phromphong By UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

It is also conveniently located within walking distance from Mercuryville, Central World, Siam Paragon shopping centers as well as Lumphini Park and Erawan Shrine. The staff was incredibly sweet and accommodating, especially Naphat, who was always there to guide our Grab cars, answer our questions and suggest great places to visit closeby. Also worth mentioning is the Diora spa, a few steps outside the hotel. It is a bit more expensive but worth every penny for a luxurious massage or spa treatment.

9,4.0,"We recently stayed for one night as I wanted to take the kids to Harborland and the hotel was offering a promotion with free entry, along with room upgrade, early check in/ late check out and free meal for kids. It was a good promotion for the price. We had a two bedroom corner suite on the same floor as the pool which was very convenient. Being relatively new, the hotel is clean and modern with a stylish pool/ bar area. Breakfast was good, if a little limited, but the lunch we had was a little disappointing. Another downside was they only issued one room key and this stopped working a couple of hours before check out. It was quickly resolved, but not ideal when you’re trying to get your kids showered and changed after swimming,Staff were friendly and helpful. We’d definitely stay again if they ran a similar promotion, as the hotel is in a great location.",Sindhorn Midtown Hotel Bangkok,5.0

EAT restaurant made us an impressive welcome with spacious high ceiling space located at Sindhorn Midtown Hotel, right on Lungsuen Road. “Saneh Jaan” is famous for first-class materials from all across Thailand  for food preparation and I hope this Tr. Eat restaurant keep the same strategy because the food taste good. (I didn't have time to find information about this material thing while we were there).We were a big party of 60, 30 kids and 30 adults, that well seated (kept) in one section of the restaurant and everyone loved what we ordered. We only selected a la carte menu and some stater dishes, Pad Thai goong sod, Tung tong Sai gai, but now thinking about coming back to try other main dishes.This restaurant has reasonably price and good service, I think it is good for family and couples. I'm not sure about post COVID atmosphere, since we visited there when the country border was not lifted as yet and there were not many people, but I'm sure that they will be getting more traffic.

64,5.0,"I live in Bangkok but wanted a change of scenery and decided to book 3 nights at this hotel. I'm not sure where to start - everything from beginning to end was pretty amazing- Room (Urban Premier): minimal design but makes you feel at home. Perfect for WFH: great wifi, usb plugs, big enough deskSuper comfy bed, smart TV and there are many amenities you can ask for.- Facilities: the infinity pool itself is quite worth the stay and offers a 180 degree view of Bangkok. It feels quite amazing to witness the hustle and bustle from your sunbed. Haven't used the gym but it shares the same view as the pool- Location: it's right in the middle of Bangkok yet feels so quiet and relaxing. Chidlom BTS is a 5 min walk, Lumpini park a 10 min walk. Around the hotel you have plenty of options to eat indoors and outdoors (Mercury ville, Velaa, Craft and Bar Yard at Kimpton, all the restaurants on Langsuan) and if you're in the mood for it there are street food stalls accross the street- Service: expect nothing less from a 5* hotel. Front desk and porters were all so professional and genuinely attentive.If you're hesitating I'd say it really is worth the try and they currently have some quite interesting deals. I'm condering going back for a longer stay!",Sindhorn Midtown Hotel Bangkok,5.0

However, we were left feeling disappointed and, on occasions, uncomfortable by the cold and impersonal front of house team, to the surly waiting staff at Mojjo Rooftop Lounge. The lounge is frequented by outside guests, as well as those staying in the hotel. From the service that we received, it actually appeared as though we were inferior customers at dinner because we were staying in the hotel.We were recommended this establishment by a member of our expat community, but we cannot do the same, based on this experience.

Turned the aircon on and it wasn’t cooling the room off.  After about an hour of the aircon on full blast it was still sweltering hot and I was sweating like crazy.  I called the front desk and maintenance came up and worked on the aircon for about 30 minutes.  He determined he couldn’t fix it.  I spoke with the manager asking for nothing more than another room with working aircon, simple right.  This guy was unbelievable, he told me I could stay in the room for another 3 hours or leave and they will try and fix the aircon.  If that didn’t work they would look into another room.  Long story short, I got a refund and left the hotel.  This manager was so horrible and rude like I can’t even understand.  He should be ashamed of how he treats guests, and I told him so.  As an example of what great customer service is.  Upon leaving I booked the Landmark and while checking in I shared my story with their manager.  She could not believe my story.  Because of my experience she upgraded me to a way nicer room at no charge.  What a difference a hotel makes.  I will never go to the sky bar or stay in this hotel ever again.

29,4.0,"We booked the hotel much earlier and so the price was reasonable. The location was a plus point because it is just besides Emporium Shopping Mall and walking distance to EmQuartier and BTS. Therefore location is excellent.We stayed in Premier Room. Nice and spacious room. It was clean, thanks to iB(HK) who cleaned our room throughout the stay. However, a few points I wish to highlight to the hotel so that they can improve better. The aircon was a bit noisy and was louder when at night where surroundings is quiet. Toilet drainage seems to have problem. The glass panel at bathtub looks like a high risk possible accident. The side of glass is fixed to the wall, but the bottom of the glass panel is not. Hence, if someone accidentally hold the glass panel as support, it could break the glass panel and create danger. In additional, due to the gap, water can flow out to the toilet floor causing floor of the toilet very wet. This part, maybe you can take a look of how to improve it. Glue the bottom of the glass panel with silicon or something. I think there is a housekeeping room in our level and we could hear her talking or shouting loudly sometimes when we are sleeping inside the room. It is fine but if you are a light sleeper, this could be a noise to you and affect your sleep. Maybe the management can remind the staff to talk softly. The breakfast spread has western, chinese food, fruits etc. However, it did not change much during our stay. Hence, this is quite bored to us though. Haha. Other than that, all are fine. I think I will come back again to stay next time.",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

38,3.0,"We booked a club grand premier room in this hotel on the 28th floor. Checkin was fast and friendly, room equipped according our expectations, however, a little small considering it should be a „Grand“ room. After checkin we enjoyed the nice pool, then decided to go up to the Mojjo and Vanilla sky bar (separate review). When trying to go up we faced long waiting times with the escalator for the first time. This continued during our stay especially when there were private events on the upper floors.Several times we faced the situation that elevators were blocked by the staff bringing stuff from lower floors to upper floors and vice versa. Again not only long waiting times, but if elevator finally arrived it was simply not possible to go in. Also there is only one elevator for both, the parking lots which are on the lowest floors, and the bars on the highest floors. Consequently in the evening bar and parking guests are blocking each other.Our first breakfast we had in the Silver Lining executive lounge. Not only the choice was somehow very limited, but having only 1 other guest beside us the service did not clean our table nor could we order a second cup of coffee for more than 10 minutes: no staff available at all. So changed to normal breakfast room next day where choice and service was much better, however, asking ourselves why we booked premier room.Summary: average hotel, definitely not 5*.  Not sure if we will return considering the many other options in BKK.",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

45,5.0,"This is a truly 5 star experience. We stayed here 5 nights over new year and it was an amzing stay. The hotel is luxurius, bright, modern and the location is amazing. We had the family connecting suit and its superb. 92 sqm with to bedrooms and bathrooms, open kitchen with a lounge. It got three TVs and three individual ACs. But the best was the clublevel access. What a bargain it was, when we discovered what was included. Amazing breakfast, all day softdrinks, end it said canapees and drinks 6-8pm. It was not canapees but an buffet and ala carte from the same kitchen as the Mojjo Restaurant. And free flow of longdrinks, wine, beer etc. We ate and drank for at leat 3000thb evey day and we also got an very good rate for the suite. The service etc was excellent, and the location is just superb. The best shoppingmalls and skytrain right outside. There is only one negativ thing and that was when we had new years dinner at the Mojjo in 32.floor and discovered that they charge 370thb for a bottle of water! I dont care if its imported from the northpole, its water...anyway, the room are restocked with plenty of local water every day for free so its not a disaster to pay 370thb as we did, but a little uneccesary I think.But altogheter this must be the best 5-star hotel we ever stayd in when comparing quality/price, and probably among top 5 hotels regardless of price.

Wait for 1 & half hours long for re-arrangement but still can only offered us 1 king & 1 twin on the same floor.  No air-conditioning on the 3rd and 4th night made us not sleep well at all and forced us to move to other room on the lower floor near the garbage room.  Under such room re-arrangement we cannot go up to meet my family whenever we want because the room key only allows you to access the floor where you stay.

55,4.0,"Have stayed at Compass Skyview Hotel by Compass Hospitality (SkyView Grand Premier Room) for 3 nights during end Nov 2019.LOCATION* Get off at BTS-Phrom Phong Exit 2.  There are two ways to Hotel : (a) there is a footbridge on the left hand side to Emporium (M/F), go to G/F, where there is an exit next to Starbucks (taxi station in front of Starbucks), the hotel is exactly next to this exit. (2) take the stairs (left hand side) down to the main road, turn into the inner street next to NaRaYa Bag store, it takes about 5 minutes to the hotel. However, the pavement is narrow, it might be inconvenient if carry big luggage.* There is a big 7-11 convenience store opposite to the hotel.* From BTS-Phrom Phong Exit 2, you could go directly to Emporium and EmQuartier (they are facing each other); both have food court and Gourmet Market. * Many local food stalls around the hotel.* Only one stop from BTS Asok, where the MRT Sukhumvit MRT is.   Hotel Service* My husband had contacted the hotel in advance, advised them that this is our wedding anniversary holiday.  Thank you for their warm hospitality, they have arranged a cake and sweet decoration in the room for us.* The swimming pool is not big and there are only about ten sundeck chairs, but the swimming pool is clean and the lady in charge is very nice. We really enjoy the swimming and the sunshine.* We just have tried the breakfast during our stay.  We are satisfied with the variety and taste of food, the most impressive point is they offer hot milk and great coffee (also offer coffee in the lobby during day time).* If I need to mention one shortcoming, the only thing that I hope the hotel could improve is ...... the toilet is spacious, but there is nowhere to hang the wet swimming suit (there is only a small hook outside the shower booth), which bothered us.

Luckily, GREEn and another staff calmed me down, paid me the taxi, called the shopping center that I thought I have lost the wallet. Furthermore, the hotel management team, ms TIK helped to check in the room without any payment in advance. All of them taked care of me while I was so worried. They actually closely follow up with the shopping center if there is any news. After taking a shower, luckily i found out the wallet right in my luggage at the bottom.

The staff were very efficient and took quick measures to fix this issue with a free upgrade to a unit with the correct facilities. This was impressive to say the least, and i would like to give special thanks to the female employee who took the initiative to get this done. I was not in time to get her name unfortunately, but she wore glasses, had short hair, and could speak Mandarin.

97,5.0,My friend and I stayed at the hotel about a month ago. The location of this hotel was great. We only booked the hotel 2 days ahead and we didn't even have time to exchange some thai bucks before I went. The hotel was right next to a mall that had a great currency exchange shop famous for reasonable / high exchange rate (superrich). The breakfast buffet there was not bad as well. The staff there were really well trained and provided exceptional customer service. The first person we met at the front desk was Pao HK. He is a very nice guy greeted us with smile.

Stayed in a suite. Suites were fine but felt a little bare although they had all the expected amenities. Adding some colour/rug/cushions and a few little touches of luxury/comfort could really take things up a notch, but this is not a criticism at all just an observation. Had a pleasant stay with good service. V decent breakfast and overall much better value for money than Emporium suites in my opinion if you are looking to stay in close proximity to Emquartier. Would stay again, especially given the unbeatable location. ",SKYVIEW Hotel Bangkok,4.5

5,4.0,"We did a quick staycation at the Banyan Tree, and stayed in one of their club suites. There's a lot of positive things to say about this hotel. First, the location on Sathorn road makes it pretty accessible to things. The sheer size of the hotel, at over 60 stories is pretty impressive. And the rooftop bars and restaurants are really hard to beat. The views from the rooms, and from the rooftop venues is really quite exceptional. Overall the experience here is good. You shouldn't be disappointed with a stay here. The hotel interiors are beginning to look a little dated, though. Not because they are worn out, but just because design trends have changed, and newer hotels reflect those changes.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5
6,5.0,"No words can describe how good my experience was on the Saffron cruise by Banyan tree and the level of detail and organisation from Jim who helped me to organise a surprise engagement proposal to my girlfriend (now Fiancé, she did say yes!) Jim organised everything for me, where the best seats were for the proposal (table 61 upstairs, on the top deck in front of the beautiful Wat Arun), arranging a bottle of champagne, Flowers and getting a book on the boat secretly so that my Fiancé would not know. From the moment we arrived on the boat the service was exceptional from our waiter First who was amazing from the moment we got on to the moment we left the cruise, we was escorted to our reserved table for a pre drink overlooking icon Siam and all the beautiful places along the river, then we was escorted down to the dinner table and a bottle of champagne was waiting. A massive thank you to the chefs also, the food was amazing, it was the best red chicken curry  we’ve had since being in thailand over two years! First our waiter then escorted us back up to our table to have our dessert, where the proposal took place, First and his team helped to film it and take lots of pictures for us to make our evening really special and one we will never forget!

The bed was good at least The bath soap was empty and the amenities look so cheapWe asked for ice cub. They bring us a ice container with 3 kg of cubs :-) ... see photoThe bedroom doesn’t have window!!! Only the living room has a window...Dinner at vertigo : MY MAIN DISAPPOINTMENT!

27,3.0,"We booked this hotel at the last minute due to what we thought was a very competitive price for a 5 star hotel. Alas, having just stayed at the new Marriott Marquis on Sukhumvit Soi 22 and the Marriott  in Hua Hin, we realised how spoiled we had been in those new and fresh hotels.The Banyan Tree is set back off what is a very busy road, with not much close by.  It is surrounded by high rise office blocks, so not a particularly convenient or interesting location.  When driving into the hotel, you have to go behind the building that is on the road. When you get to the drop off area, it is very small, un-inviting and with no doorman waiting outside. At first, we thought we had inadvertently arrived at the service entrance to the hotel.The doorman, singular, was ok but not particularly friendly or welcoming. Check in was smooth and efficient.On going to the room on the 23rd floor, we noticed that the hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed properly. Some of the wall paper was peeling from the walls. On entering the room there was a damp smell. The room is quite tired, the TV is small and ancient. Initially, the TV didn't switch on when I pressed the power button on the remote. I had to actually find the power button on the TV itself, to then put it on standby, before the remote would work. The TV also looks ugly, with cables hanging down from under it, with an old and frayed cable tidy, and an ancient infra red mouse eye clumsily stuck onto the exterior of the screen. The channel choice is average, the wifi is adequate. The room comes with a coffee percolator, which is nice. However, housekeeping had not provided any of the coffee bags for it to work. However, when I called reception, these were provided quickly. Alas, the coffee was not to my taste anyway. The shower screen has not been cleaned properly, with smears on the glass.  The bed is comfortable, but the pillows are quite thick, so may not be to everyone's preference. They provided a small fruit plate in the room, and the minibar is quite well stocked with a good selection of spirits and wine/beer. In summary, with the huge choice of hotels in Bangkok, I would not stay here again.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Thun is very friendly. After met me at arrival hall, he brought me to the limousine. Along the way, he tried to engage with me by starting small talk & provided me necessary info. He even asked me if I would like to use washroom before depart from airport as the journey will take approx 40mins to hotel. So caring Next, I met K. Suthep, the limo driver. Another guy with a warm smile (even covered with mask) make me feel at ease. He checked on me to ensure that my whole journey is comfortable. He is very knowledgeable even just joined the company for 6 months. The whole journey is flawless. When I reach hotel lobby, the Front Office Manager K. Oat already waited me at the entrance, with welcome drinks & snacks. After having a cool chilling homemade welcome drinks, I was directly escorted to my room for in-room check in. WOW! WOW! WOW! The room was SUPERB! With a nice setup of welcome amenities (yummilicious snacks prepared by chef) & nicely printed photos in frames placed in the room. This make me feel really like my HOME. The team is so resourceful and pay attention to every single details to make me feel like home. I think they know that I have not back to my hometown for at least a year due to COVID-19 situation. So lovely! After a tiring day of travelling, K. Kanya, the spa therapist really make me whole body very relax. The 3 hours treatment was really FANTASTIC. Royal Banyan Spa Package really worth for a great experience. I even snooze off several time because it was too relax & his skills is really fabulous. After spa treatment, is dinner time! And i misssssss Hong Kong cuisine so much. I was craving for it for several months as I couldn't travel to Hong Kong. So I went to Baiyun Restaurant. Opps... I forget to make reservation and was fully booked  The hostess told me that I need to wait around 1.5hrs for the next table. After 30mins, the hostess called me that there is a table available. Yahoo... The waiters & waitresses have been very nice to me as I was dining alone. They keep on checking me if I like the food, the food is enough and etc. They recommended me all yummy food. Excellence service. Thanks to the chef too. Yummmmy dimsum Everyday I passby the lobby and met the Security & Concierge. They always greet me with a warm smile. I can feel it even they were wearing the mask. I can sense the warm & sincere greeting & care. Maybe this is the authentic Thai culture?

Then I went to Saffron Cruise for dinner.For hotel, very nice staffs, cleaned room, delicious food. Very appreciated with Khun Jackie, Chief Concierge. He gave very good information and made us happy and ensure that hotel had potocal for COVID 19 prevention.After that I went to Saffron Cruise, have to go Tier 2 and show voucher to staff on 06.15 PM. Cruise left from tier around 06.45 PM (Very on time).Foods served with 3 courses and 1 appetizer. I love all of them.

60,1.0,"We both have travelled a lot and have stayed at the Banyan Tree many years ago. Not a lot has changed in decoration and style. We booked a suite as it was a good promotion but the price is not the most important part for us, as that would be the experience and good service. (Days, weeks, months or years later people have forgotten about the price but the good memories or bad have not been forgotten)Lobby was ok (not a grand style) and looked fine but it was not cozy. We checked in and were given 2 keys and pointed to the elevators. We did not had many bags but the bell man sorted our bags out. He did not enter the room but that was ok. We were very disappointment by the room. The bedroom had NO WINDOW and was dark. The room was very cold and the colors in the room were not warm either. The ""sitting room"" was nothing special but it had a window, however the window was blocked! (When we asked another day if all the other rooms had the same the front desk lady answer no this is the only one that has a blocked view. Why we were given this room as the hotel was 98% empty? Does the customer experience not come first here? (As a Platinum card member I could have booked a cheaper room and have a free lounge with breakfast on top instead of booking a suite but never mind) The suite came with access to the club lounge. The lounge was closed and we were told to sit here at the Reception/ Check-in area where you can have some drinks. (WOW??) It did not make me feel special at all.  Drinks came with some snacks but they were not as expected. Snacks at the 7-11 were better. Mirco waved soft snacks that were supposed the be crispy. The lady was lovely and apologised. My partner felt sorry for her as she was embarrassed serving us these snacks. We booked for 2 nights, the next day we did not want to used the ""club lounge""anymore as we were quite happy to pay for our wines and food anywhere else. Breakfast was a la carte with baby size plates clearly not enough. I asked for some bread items but the came so later that we did not touch them. Banyan Tree if you give something then please give something nice and of good quality or nothing at all! Tip for your GM: Please visit the JW Marriott (close to you) and see what can be possible in these times. You will be amazed. Happy staff and happy guests in a busy breakfast lounge every day and a good working Club lounge. If you thing you can do it please do so otherwise leave it. Your customers will not be impressed with what you are offing now. (I am sure they all say that they do understand and so did we, but do not forget that we have a good choice of hotels to choose from!) I will not be coming back to this property!",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

69,3.0,"The hotel is set back of Sathon Tai road. Both BTS and MRT stations are located about 10-15 minutes walk away. Some convenience stores are located within few minutes of walking. Mr.Nueng from frontdesk provided a fast check-in process. Check-out was also smooth.My original purpose was to try their new Serenity Club Room, but it appears that they closed down some high floors during weekdays, so they put me in 2-bedroom suite which is located on lower floors instead. The suite was very spacious. It may be worth the upgrade, but it contradicts my original purpose.The suite was clean, but I spotted stain on carpet, sofa and chairs.Guest service was prompt and professional.Wi-Fi internet was extremely bad, weak signal, and was not stable throughout my stay. It was able to get only 1-6 Mbps in some parts of the room. This should not happens in a 5-star hotel. They should replace their ancient wireless access point (802.11g) to newer model and install more of them for better coverage.TVs in my suite were Smart TV, but I could not make use of any smart feature from them. The hotel should make a great improvement on their Wi-Fi and network, and put TVs onto the network, so that guests can enjoy own's content from their devices.Moon bar on the rooftop was provided good drinks with stunning view of Bangkok and attentive service.Overall it was a nice hotel with clean room, good amenities and great service, but the Wi-Fi was awful.",Banyan Tree Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Thank you to the front desk - you gave us a lifelong everlasting memory. Our stay was relatively short so we couldn't sample all the hotel has to offer (and didn't want to leave our delightful room) however we did take a trip to the rooftop Moon Bar and it really is a 'must do' as the views and the atmosphere were truly amazing.  It would be difficult to find fault with any aspect of our stay, so suffice to say we were extremely impressed with the staff, the room, the location and definitely the rooftop Moon Bar.

He gave us the most exciting recommendations for restaurant (that cater towards our very specific needs)as well as sights to visit that is off the beaten path, which in my opinion shows that his knowledge is very in-depth, personal and not taken out of your run of the mill guide book.

4,5.0,"After its opening last year, I always had an eyes on staying here. Finally I had a chance to stay at Capella Bangkok. I would say staycation more than 24 hours here was beyond my expectation. Hotel facilities and design were good however what made this place so special were attentive staffs. From culturist/check in staffs who can literally remember our names. Our favorite staffs were at pool as they could really remember our names the other days as I believed there were so many guests visiting the pool. Cote was the best and became my top 3 favorite in Bangkok. Staffs were brilliant as well. The only down side, but not so disturbing, was the misspelling of my name on welcoming letter, as I believed Thai name may be quite difficult sometimes. The room was spacious and very well equipped. Balcony really made for such chilled out, even in this super hot weather. Writing this long, I would say I highly recommended this hotel for anyone's stay or staycation in Bangkok.

6,5.0,"My stayed at Capella from last month.       My unforgettable moment journey start from  the moment that arrival to the hotel. When entering at lobby which is tea lounge. Floor to ceiling window facing to the Chao Phraya River, unique design and interior that make you would like to take a snapshot then post via story social media. Time to check in, The Living Room is a place that offer respite from the vibrant bustle beyond its wall. A guest who is not stay at the hotel can not access to this area. So privacy. Bubbles and Bonbons upon arrival so privilege luxury. Welcome drink at Capella is not ordinary same as the others. Capella Sparkling Wine is an answer for Capella guest. They will make them “Beyond Expectation”. Riverfront Premier Room for my stay. So impressed. Stunning Panoramic View of Chao Phraya River from floor to ceiling directly facing which were unforgettable. Room style is a residentially with a private balcony. Spacious walk-in wardrobe. Generous marble bathroom. Bespoke toiletries such as Marvis toothpaste etc. Complimentary non-alcoholic mini- bar. Acqua Panna Natural Mineral Drink. Tranquility Calm and Relax feels home once you step inside. In the same way feels luxury in details that were extraordinary experiences. The resort activities were a great for a guest . Especially Cin Cin Hour i would said that “Do not miss”. Breakfast near the river so memorable with premium quality choice of variety food. Japanese style a la carte food must try it. Shibuya Toast must order. I would highly recommend everyone should stay here. You will not be disappointed. One night i would say it is not enough. All outlets at Capella you should try. Stella, Côte, Phra Nakorn, Tea Lounge. All were great in own style. A moment experiences that become lifelong memories which could not happens without Capella Staff. All Capella Staff were Top-Noted hospitality services. Special mentioned staff: K.Joy who is my best No.1 service excellence in highest levels of hospitality, K.Nisa Stella, K.Pony, K. Oat Pool. K.Art Côte. Especially K.John Blanco who is always took care and greeted closely with guest with friendly warm welcome smile. A moment when check out, Some hotel after check out will let guest leave without great experiences and memorable but at Capella not like that. K. Pony who is a person who check out for my stay and fond farewell and also my art hotel tour. So excellence in hospitality services. That was unforgettable experiences. She escort us to the pier to leave to hotel as last fond farewell. I think this process it is not necessary to do but not in Capella Bangkok. Truly Ultra Luxury Hotel. ",Capella Bangkok Hotel,5.0
7,5.0,"When I stayed at Four Seasons Bangkok a few weeks ago I noticed that the new Capella hotel was immediately next door and found out that both properties actually have the same owner which raised my interest.  I decided to try Capella for the first time and was more impressed than by our stay at Four Seasons.  I suspect some travelers will choose Four Seasons based on name recognition and the lower price tag for the entry level rooms but in my opinion Capella is well worth the price premium and beats Four Seasons in almost every aspect.  Capella views their main competitor to be Mandarin Oriental rather than FS.  I found the service at Capella to be more down to earth therefore appealing to a different age bracket than the more formal Mandarin Oriental.  Many people generally consider MO to be the #1 hotel in Bangkok and I predict that in short order Capella will gain a significant number of fans and will eventually overtake MO as the top luxury hotel in the city.  To maximize the advantage of being located on the river, the vast majority of rooms at Capella are directly facing the river, even the entry level rooms.  This is quite different from Four Seasons where the first two room types have no view or only partial views.  For direct river views you need the third room type at FS and for this reason alone it automatically makes price comparisons between the two hotels flawed if only comparing the price of the cheapest rooms at both properties.  In other words, Capella is less of a price premium over FS than we would be led to believe at first glance.The entry level room at Capella is the Riverfront room type which are the rooms on the 4th floor only.  The second room type Riverfront Premier is identical but located on floors 5-10.  Those rooms avoid the main drawback of the entry level rooms which is that they are sitting immediately above the Verandah rooms and have less privacy because from the terrace of the Verandah rooms, if looking back up you can partially see in the living room of the 4th floor rooms despite the tinted windows.  The third category of rooms used to be Verandah but because they have been far more popular than expected, the hotel moved them up to 4th room type.  The Verandah rooms are the same as Riverfront and Riverfront Premier except that instead of having a small terrace, they have a large terrace with a private plunge pool which makes them unique.  This room type capitalizes on the strength of Capella which is location and having river views.  Those rooms are hard to beat for any other hotel in Bangkok.  Privacy was fairly good on each side of the pool due to vegetation providing a natural wall between rooms.  Our room was similar as Four Seasons which is good but perhaps not the highest quality build in the city.  The materials did not always come across as ultra-luxury for example the cabinets, some of the furniture, and for flooring there was too much carpet to my taste – the hardwood floor was only a small fringe on the sides of the bedroom; quite narrow so nobody could walk there.  In that regard I think Waldorf Astoria and Sindhorn Kempinski feel more luxurious with more expansive hardwood floors.  The bathroom was smaller at Capella than at Four Seasons and the bathtub being in the middle of the bathroom was a bit cumbersome, and similar to FS the toilet was not a Toto washlet, another luxury miss in my opinion and a notch below what can be found in the suites at Waldorf Astoria and Park Hyatt, and also found at lower levels of hotels such as Athenee and Le Meridien.  Bathroom amenities at Capella were great, 100 ml metallic bottles custom-made for Capella Bangkok from La Bottega which reminded me of the bottles at Mandarin Oriental.For people who want to spend even more, Capella also has villas right on the river rather than the rooms in the main building, the villas also having their own private plunge pool as well but having the advantage of more privacy because they are not visually exposed to rooms above them.   Service during our stay was not perfect but it would be unfair to expect a 6-month old hotel to perform as well as MO which is over 100 years old and one of the best service-oriented hotels in all of Asia.  Some minor mistakes were made for example when I asked if I could visit the Courtyard Suites I was told none were available because maintenance was currently there.  I believe if a customer wants to see new room types to steer future stays, they should propose alternatives (time or other rooms) rather than send me back.  Anyway, overall service was very friendly and down to earth, in contrast to the highly polished, formal, and professional service at MO.  This was the case at reception, in the restaurant, the bar, etc. and overall superior to what we experienced at Four Seasons which is almost an equally new hotel.  At Capella I should also note that they prepared a welcome arrangement in the room and also gave us a frame of the picture they took of us at check-in which was a nice touch.  I believe in the next few months Capella will continue to make some strides and be better positioned to rival MO although with a different style, and probably fitting to a different clientele profile than MO so maybe not direct competition.  Breakfast was mostly a la carte and I found the menu to be a step above The Siam, MO, and FS.  In my opinion the best luxurious breakfast in Bangkok remains 137 Pillars and the best buffet is Waldorf Astoria but Capella was definitely top 5 of those I tried before.  Breakfast included an in-house Champagne welcome drink, a Japanese breakfast set with grilled salmon (which was specifically excluded when we stayed at MO) among the several choices in the extensive a la carte menu.  Service could have been a bit better for small details, for example at Waldorf Astoria staff constantly refill drinks as soon as our glass is half empty and they promptly replace cutlery after every dish which was not always done at Capella in the morning.The Stella bar had live music and seems to be quite popular already as it was almost full even on week evenings.  Service was excellent with staff providing detailed explanations of their different types of in-house cocktails representing 4 countries: Thailand, China, India, and Japan.  While Mandarin Oriental has Le Normandie restaurant, at Capella they are attempting to outdo MO with the Côte restaurant from 3-Michelin starred chef Mauro Colagreco.  We tried their Inspiration Menu which was absolutely superb and the highlight of our stay, particularly service-wise which was highly attentive and personal.  Similar to Stella, it was surprising to find out that they were almost full already and in fact they expected to be fully booked starting in one week’s time.  Since I am pregnant we did not try the wine pairing but next time we dine at Côte I am looking forward to pick that option for a more complete experience.Overall while Capella was not perfect it did well in almost all aspects: (1) not the best room but if considering river views and especially the room types with a private pool it gives an edge over other hotels; (2) some minor service improvements are needed but already considerably ahead of FS and making guests feel comfortable at home; (3) the Stella bar can compete toe to toe with Bamboo bar at MO; (4) the fine dining Côte restaurant has potential to become the very best in the city, both food-wise and service-wise; and (5) location is as good as it gets for a leisure-oriented hotel.  The price point is similar to MO but rooms at Capella are far more spacious (60+ sqm) than the smallish room we had to MO last time (35 sqm) and while Capella is more expensive than FS if we compare to the rooms with river views at FS then the price difference becomes modest.  It should also be emphasized that FS is a big hotel with 300 rooms while Capella only has 100 rooms which is more appropriate for an ultra-luxury property and it will almost always be easier for Capella to deliver top notch service than FS.  I can highly recommend to luxury hotels lovers to try Capella and see if it meets what they are looking for - it did for us.",Capella Bangkok Hotel,5.0

9,5.0,"Spent a weekend at the Verandah room at Capella. It’s a blissful experience, with the jacuzzi plunge pool to enjoy over a very serene river view. With a large terrace, we decide to order an in-room BBQ. To our surprise, a whole set of BBQ with dining table was set up with full staff service through the period - very glamorous setting in a cosy evening. Lots of complementaries  - Signature Champaign, unlimited imported mineral water, cake & fruit plates, mini bar, the Living Room service etc.. made the entire stay uplifting. Details of the room and the  entire hotel were clearly thought through carefully, and was excellently maintained.  Turndown and other services were beyond expectation in many regards, not to mention wet swimsuits were washed and dried back in a couple of hours without request.  All in all, it was more pricey than staycation at other luxury hotels in Bangkok, but really unique experience and worth the visit. ",Capella Bangkok Hotel,5.0
10,5.0,"My husband and I had our wedding and honeymoon at Capella Bangkok. We both had a truly wonderful and memorable experience. The property and its design are gorgeous and Capella Bangkok gets even more breathtaking from the first minute of walking in until the last day of our stay. The staff are all delightful, hospitable and efficient. They made our stay very comfortable, enjoyable and most of all unforgettable...We stayed at VERANDAH SUITE with spacious outdoor terrace with a jacuzzi plunge pool. The suite worth every penny because of its high quality room and its facilities. The amenities were impressive with excellent selection of materials (sustainable choices too with NO plastic!). There was unlimited complimentary Acqua Panna mineral water and non-alcoholic beverages being served throughout our stay. Loved it!For our wedding ceremony at Capella Bangkok, everything went above and beyond! My husband and I received so many positive compliments from our wedding guests about the perfect service quality, delicious food, beautiful property and amazing staff. We couldn’t be any happier. We’d like to take this opportunity and say a special ‘Thank you’ to some of the staff members who made our wedding and our stay at Capella Bangkok so memorable...Khun Pantip, thank you for being such a fantastic brand ambassador of Capella Bangkok, well presenting the property to us and made us feel that this property is the perfect place where we both wanted to get married. Your kind-hearted and honest personality impressed us so much and it also created great trust of Capella brand in both of us. Thanks for making our wedding dream came true! Khun Poupae, we both want to express our great appreciation to you who took care of us pre-, during- and post-wedding. Your finest attention to details gave us such a big peace of mind that our wedding would be flawless and it literally was on the wedding day! You led our wedding preparation and actual operations with high efficiency without any delay. Your team shown such a great team work and coordination. My husband and I could feel that this team is a “people of passion” team. I still remember the night prior to the wedding that Khun Phuk helped us with the final setup until late at night (we had a few last-minute requests to him and he managed to finished them all) and then we met him the next day early in the morning running the wedding ceremony until the end with his colleagues. Thank you for your hard work! Khun Nid, Thank you for being with the bride and groom during the wedding reception making sure we both were hydrated. You were always there next to us when we needed something like you could read our minds. Thank you very much for your kind hospitality.Last but not least, we wanted to thank Khun Fern for being with the bride at all time helping with the wedding dress even after the event :-). I knew it must have been very exhausted for you as my wedding dress was quite heavy! Thank you ever so much for your patience and care! You didn’t let me out of your sight of care. Impressive!Finally, we’d like to thank Capella Bangkok’s General Manager for hiring and retaining the best people. It is not just the rooms and the property that make a hotel stay a wonderful one – it is how your people care for our needs. We are extremely grateful you have an amazing team at your property!Lastly, we highly recommend Capella Bangkok to anyone looking for the perfect and unforgettable stay in Bangkok.

16,5.0,"My husband and I first visited Capella Bangkok in November 2020 to try their famous Thai food at Phra Nakhon, we loved the food there so much that we revisited a few more times in the following weeks. Chef Lek and Phra Nakhon never disappointed us, most dishes are very authentic, some with a twist but they came out great. The staffs even remembered our names and what we’re allergic to on our following visits.We were very impressed with the food and services so we decided to have our engagement at Capella. K.Poupae has always been helpful since day 1 of preparation process until we check out, she was more than just an assistant or a hotel sales/staff, but rather a friend who’s always been there for us. The function came out better than we expected and that meant a lot to us on our big day, big thanks to K.Poupe, K.Tle and the operation team. Capella Culturists K.Pam, K.Arther and K.Suzie were also of great help to us.Their High Tea is a must for any dessert enthusiast and tea lover, our family was impressed with the quality and craftsmanship of every piece of dessert from Chef Constans. This is by far my most favourite high tea in Bangkok.We were also lucky to get a dinner table at Côte, the new talk-of-the-town in Bangkok. Most dishes were outstanding and exciting, very creative combination of ingredients. The staffs were professional, knowledgable and highly attentive. This is one of the best fine-dinings in Bangkok that you can’t miss! Special thanks to K.Sutut and K.Art, you have made our dinner a memorable one.The whole Capella experience we had on the past months was way beyond our expectation, we would like to thank everyone and hope to see you all again soon.",Capella Bangkok Hotel,5.0
17,5.0,"I have stayed at almost all of the 5-star hotels in Bangkok and it wouldn't be difficult for me to find ""good"" hotels here. However, finding a hotel that gives me a ""wow"" is a different story and thus much more challenging. The Capella Bangkok truly gave me that ""wow"" experience for which I am not sure if I can find any other places in Bangkok that can do the same. The service here is absolutely world class and everything is so personalised that makes me feel that the hotel truly cares about every single detail of its guests. My  culturist, Khun Pam took such a great care of me and my wife right from checkin to bidding us farewell at our car which really make our staycation so memorable. We got a riverfront premier room on the 10th floor which was very classy and elegant with spectacular view of the Chaopraya river.  I have stayed at almost all hotels by the Chaopraya river and I can say with confidence that the view here is truly the best.We also had a fantastic time for our dinner at Cote restaurant. Each dish was prepared with great skills and premium ingredients. I also wish to thank khun Sutut for providing excellent service and Khun Jay, the sommelier who is very knowledegable and made excellent wine choice suggestions. Throught my whole stay, everything was so perfect. But if I can give a small suggestion, maybe my roon was quite too warm in the afternoon as the sun was directly facing the window and the aircon was already working at its full capacity. Last but not least, I can say without any reservation that up until now the Capella Bangkok is one of the few places that gave me the ""wow"" factor and among these few places, the Capella Bangkok surely stands as No.1 in my mind now.",Capella Bangkok Hotel,5.0

It's not just a ""high standard hotel"" but it aims to personalize the service and give you the best experience you could ever have when staying away from home. The attention to detail is unbelievable and the fact that all staffs are so friendly and care so much to know your feedback in all activities and service you are using is incredible. The food is so great but in Phra Nakorn and Cote. The room has a splendid view of the river and the bedding is just super comfortable. Also you will be very surprise that you have unlimited ""Acqua Panna"" to drink the entire stay !!!! Well, what else can I say.... I will definitely spend my time there again.

20,5.0,"We were impressed with The Capella Bangkok from the very first moment we stepped out of the car. Yes the hotel rate is perhaps the most expensive in Bangkok at the moment but the experience we received is worth every penny and much more. I honestly don't think it even covers the cost. The view from every room is stunning. The layout is impressive. We can walk the room in loop. It also has an outdoor terrace to enjoy the view. The best thing about the Capella is the services. The staffs warmly greeted us  with nickname. They researched about the guests and carefully designed how to personally take care of us every step of the way.  Our culturist was Khun Mick, who was always there for everything. There are a few activities offered daily. We joined Cin-cin hours by Cote and by Stella Bar which were superb. I must mention Khun Nook at Stella bar who offered to show the bar even when it was closed due to Covid19 restriction. We also enjoyed the pool and poolside Pinto meals as we were entertained by Khun Namnow and Khun Toey. They were so much fun to be with. I attended a private yoga class by Khun Milk who was highly professional and very sweet. We also used the vitality pool bcause Khun AubAib tempted us and arranged everything for us. As for meals, we loved Phra Nakhon so much, even more the Cote. Thai food there is the best in Thailand by far! Breakfast is served at Phra Nakhon by the river and we also went there for dinner. One cannot afford to miss Phra Nakhon while in the area. All in all, every inch of the hotel itself is spotlessly beautiful with genuine care. No plastic was used even for amenities.  We were treated like princesses every minute for 36 hours of our stay. Never wanted to leave.  A truly priceless experience.

However, from the moment we stepped out of the car upon arrival until the moment we departed, we were welcomed and treated very decently.  Some other 5-stars' hotels are snobbish to guests doing staycations, but we did not experience this at all during our stay.  What we experienced was the sincerity, warmth & friendliness of all staff, from the Concierge, FO, Culturists, Housekeeping, F&B outlets' Phra Nakorn, Cote & in-room dining, even the gardeners and guards, that made our experience quite memorable. We felt that every staff gave their full ""customer service from the heart,"" going above & beyond to fulfill guest's requests (within reason, of course).  Also, meeting Khun Ted and Khun KJ at all times was a nice gesture of management being accessible and available to all guests. The Verandah guest room was excellent, very clean, having well-stocked amenities and mini-bar. It was nice to relax beside the private plunge pool and eat our meals on the terrace.

And we don't miss out on paying extra to upgrade to Verandah room.For a restaurant in Phra Nakhon, the service was excellent, the food was delicious with a beautiful sunset view, and at Cote, although we missed a good seat, despite the request in advance, Khun Thibaud took very good care of us, making it a wonderful meal. Delicious food, good ingredients, and excellent service staff.Cin Cin Hour is the main selling point here. Stella Team by Khun Niza took great care of us. More than that The management team took care and greeted the guests closely, especially Mr.John and Ted, who are professional and attentive to every detail and have a typical Thai humility.

I honestly can say that this hotel is ONE OF THE BEST LUXURY HOTEL in Bangkok.I’ve stayed at Mandarin Oriental, Rosewood, Waldorf and others but there is no place else like this one.(I would rank Capella as same tier as Mandarin Oriental) The staffs were super attentive. most of the staffs from hotel seem to acknowledge every hotel guests (since my first visit I went to the pool and fitness somehow the staffs seem to know my name, that very surprised me) staffs here work hard to find out guests’s preferences to make sure guest’s satisfication. i got super tiny cuts by broken glasses and Khun Ice immediately appear at my door steps with first aid kits ( Eventhough i insist that’s not necessary) Khun Champ and Khun Mick both were really there to make sure my family and I got everything I need. they even set up the kids tents for my niece in room to enjoyed and send her treats while all the grown up are dining at restaurant ( for cote kids should be older than 5 years old ) The restaurant there is a MUST both especially for COTE. I bet they will be received Michelin star soon. Chef Davide is very talented. The food was exquisite. I’ve been to MIRAZUR in French and I can assure you that COTE is carry the similar style and standard from there. I’m the type of person who like to visit the same place over and over to make sure it’s standard before shout out the recommendation. All I could say is this place is one of my favourite restaurant in Bangkok. Khun Thibaud (restaurant manager) and especially Khun Sutut both them are excellent both service skill and food knowledge. Khun Sutut can deliver the value of dishes from chef and story of each dish perfectly.The Pranakorn (Thai restaurant) is very tasty, it’s actually very Thai original style with little twist (for some menu) It’s also highly recommendedWe tried many room typesriver front premier room type - the panoramic view of Chao playa river is highlight of this roomThe veranda - is very nice for bangkok escaping with own plunge poolThe villa is one of best memorable time there .

Given the Covid restrictions from the government that kept updating, which the hotel had to adhere to, they have made the celebration possible.  In fact, it was more memorable than it would have been in a normal situation where issue has been turned an opportunity.  Capella has created beautiful memories for us which we will never forget, and we would be happy coming back here any day. Thank you to the Capella team for our fabulous stay. A fantastic team of people such as you all can achieve anything. Best wishes from our family.",Capella Bangkok Hotel,5.0

Situated at the Charoenkrung area which is a historical street in Bangkok near Chaophraya river, the hotel incorporates everything about the way of life near Chaophraya river to the hotel decoration and concept.I stayed at Verandah room with huge jaguzzi plunge pool facing Chaophraya river. The room was gorgeously decorated, luxurious style. The bathroom was huge and nicely designed.I really love the bathroom amenity.The light of the room was not too dark which was very good. The living room of the hotel was the place we could sit back, relax and enjoy seeing the view of the river of life.The Capella Culturist who took care of me Khun “Mick” is the best. He showed and explained me every details of the hotels including the design, the sculptures, the art in the lobby. He managed to book restaurants for me and my family in spite of the nearly booked seats.The breakfast and lunch at Phranakorn restaurant was really good. Don’t forget to try Unagi Benedict and Shibuya honey toast for breakfast.Dinner at Cote was also fantastic. I tried Carte Blanche menu which Chef Davide perfectly cooked every dish for me.

8,3.0,"I stayed 2 times in the executive room at the same time. The first time was the 27th floor and the second was the 26th floor. The room: Chao Phraya River view is very beautiful. Sunset photography in the evening is spectacular. The room is beautifully decorated. Full amenities such as a sofa to sit and watch the river view, a luxurious Jacuzzi to soak in. In addition, the bathroom is separated between the shower zone and the toilet zone. The minibar is very affordable if compared to other hotels.Food: The foods we ordered for In-room dining were delicious Tom Yum Goong and steamed salmon with curry paste. I can sit and eat in my room and enjoy the view of the river. Breakfast was ok but not excellent. The cakes and coffee at the Coffee shop on the 1st floor are averages. Service: Before I check-in, I had been prepared about the service here from previous reviews. So, I didn't expect much. Front staff provided standard service and there was a defect in the number of days. But they fixed it as well. Club Lounge staff offered good service, greeted and said goodbye to all guests as well as delicious snacks and drinks with a stunning river view.My 2nd stay: Before I was preparing to check out, the hotel staff called from the front office to ask me that ""when would you like to check out? because our checkout time is 12.00 p.m."" I replied, ""I told the staff at check-in that I would like to check out at 2 pm"" (when check-in, the staff asked me that would you like to check out at 4 p.m. because you have been granted a Diamond Hilton honor member) That front office staff shouldn't call me like this because it looks so rude.

On the check out date the front gave us the coupon that expired on the check out date and charges room service normally. so we have to spend the coupon on the bakery shoo which is the only shop available in the hotel.It is normal to make mistake but the front office does not show any responsibility for their mistake for not giving us the coupon upon checking in, that's the reason that we'll never be back there again. The service quite poor compare to the hotel in the same area, no greetings, no assisting, even the luggage was drop at the door, no turn down. There's 60 THB charges for an ice bucket or any tray requests (spoon, fork, plate), no bottle opener, provide 1 toothbrush for 2 person. The window super dirty (see photo).",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
10,4.0,"I'm not sure why I'm writing this review as the management don't respond and I'll be repeating problems that many other guests have mentioned before, but here goes.The positives first.I took a staycation in a panoramic suite that had been recently renovated and was absolutely stunning; much more glamourous and interesting than it looks in the photos.The lounge was open and we enjoyed sandwiches and cakes for afternoon tea, and cheese, fried rice, (awful) tempura vegetables, and quite a lot of booze during the evening.It was my partner's birthday so the hotel gave us a cake and the lounge staff organised a 3pm check out, both of which were amazing- thank you!Why only 4.2 stars?The hotel charges a ""tray charge"" of THB60 to bring ice to your room. This is so nasty and is a money-making technique akin to a boarding-house, not a 5-star hotel. What's more, I had already paid a 10%  service charge so why they think it's okay to charge guests again is a mystery.  The other thing that brings this hotel down is how the staff close things earlier than the advertised time. The evening drinks are supposed to be until 19:00 but at 18:30 a kitchen porter was there ready to take the food away and by 18:50 everything was packed away-  ""finished"" the lounge attended gleefully announced when asked where the food had gone.   The same was with the breakfast which is supposed to close at 11 am but come 10:30 am, food is being packed away and the coffee machines are being switched off. I understand that staff want to go home as soon as they can, but for the same reason a guest would be denied service if they arrived late, the staff should not clear away so early. Also, pretending the food had ""finished"" when it hadn't (they'd just packed it away early) is not very good service at all.Additionally, the reception ladies need a few days of customer service training. They are a hard-faced crew who would be more suited to work at immigration  than a hotel- a ""hello and ""how are you"" would be better greetings than ""passports!"" and ""credit card you book with!""Again, this has been mentioned in quite a few other reviews but as nothing has changed, it must just be the culture of the hotel.Sadly, the pool area is an utter mess. I understand they are renovating but that does not excuse empty glasses and bottles discarded on the (ripped and stained) sun loungers.Finally, the boat service is still not in use ""due to covid"" which is a little silly as all the other hotels and the local authority have their boats whizzing around and I can assure you, the hotel is busy enough to warrant the service. The steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi are also either out of service ""due to covid"" or because of renovations- the staff I asked couldn't remember which excuse to give me so gave me both! I suspect that both the boat service and the sauna etc. are actually closed to save money.However, despite some of the strange rules and lacklustre service, I will return to this hotel.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

18,4.0,"We spend a two-nights staycation over a weekend.Check-in was super busy on Saturday but I still got a very friendly service and recognition of my Diamond status.We were upgraded to a beautiful Panoramic Executive Suite (#2802). The suites are showing their age although this room clearly was upgraded since our last stay about 3 1/2 years ago. We love the view from the room, partly over the beautiful Chao Praya River and the surrounding area.The Executive Lounge was unfortunately closed due to renovation works so the experience was shifted to a cafe next to the reception area. A bit busy for my taste but the spread was acceptable given the current situation. Breakfast was good although the line on Sunday morning looked like a bad day at immigration.What we did not appreciate was that dinner service consists of a buffet at the Flow and if you do not like that, the only option we had (on Saturday night) was to go for a dark snack on the rooftop. On days where that outlet is closed (which is pretty much the whole week), you may have to go for some food outside the hotel.Sadly, the river boats are also not operating at this time. What a shame. Many other riverside properties have this service now so not sure why our Hilton cannot.All in all, we still very much enjoyed our stay.

However, it seemed to be wrong. I was actually ok then. What I was a bit dissatisfied was some of the guests didn’t wear the plastic disposable gloves when they picked up some food at the executive lounge.

24,2.0,"For sure this hotel need a lot of improvements. Although the lobby looks good but there are many details that i think should be improved from the hotel1. The shuttle boat not on serviced, as a five star hotel located by the River i believe its essential to keep this service to attract more people and compete with other hotels2. The pool is lack of maintenance, many dirty mark and also u can find some dry bird dirt on the mattress 3. It is the smallest 5 star room i ever had. Its like holiday inn level (you can even see the fridge facing you everytime wake up in the morning)4. The cleaning service is not the best for 5 star hotel. I found 2 pcs of hair on my sink and shower when i just came5. The bathtub is stucked cannot drain the water after taking bath6. I was surprised when i was asking for a mask, they sell it for 10 baht/pc. Which is quite shame while other hotels is trying to implement high standard of safety by just give away for a mask. (Their neighbor hotel beside icon siam even send me mask 4pcs on daily basis to make sure everyone stay save during pandemic)Hope there would be a good improvement further for a big chain hotel like this otherwise people will just move to other hotel with better services",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

The breakfast buffet was delicious. Highly recommended",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
29,1.0,"This is a third time to stay here and it's my mistake. I booked three booking at the same time and I don't know what I will see.1. I booked the room with campaign that can early check-in and late check-out. Firstly, I call to book directly to the hotel. No one tell me that it's not guarantee and I understand that It guarantee because It list on benefit of the campaign. 1 week before check-in, I call to front to remark them about early check-in, so they cannot do anything and ask me back to call them one day before check-in. OK, 1 day before check-in, I call to front again and they said that they cannot guarantee, please call them back on check-in day. On check-in day, around 10.00am, I call to front again and they say first come, first serve. This is so terrible for me and get me annoying.2. About hotel credit voucher 1000 THB, to use in the hotel. I want to make plan to use it as alcohol drinking. I call to Hotel and ask them Which restaurant can I use and Can I use with alcoholic drinking? they say that I can use only 2 restaurants in the hotel. After that, I check again with FB Messenger and they tell me that I can use 3 restaurants that I ask them back to ensure that why staff say difference but Staff on FB guarantee that I can use in 3 restaurants. At the check-in time, staff tell me that I can use only 2 restaurants and I ask them back that Can I use to drink alcoholic drinking? they say I can use it with amount of the voucher. After I've a dinner at ICONSIAM. I go to Maya restaurant in the hotel and ask them to use. They say I cannot use this voucher for any kind of drinking that declare in the voucher. Why? My plan is failed again and again. I make a decision to buy some beers at 7-11 and when I arrive to the hotel, I go to front and complain them about mislead information. They ask me to show message on my FB messenger that my phone is in the room. In my mind, What is wrong with you staff, Did you think I'm lie?. OK, I go back to the room and take my phone to them and they try to excuse with offer me to use the voucher as I wish.3. 3 times to stay here, I and my girlfriend see dust in the air at the room that I don't know why4. There's some maintenance on 5 December 2020 that is the Father day in Thailand. What the hotel thinking about maintenance in the peak period that Thai people need to stay with their family with a good mood. Smell is so bad in the lobby and they move front check-in to SPA.

Great communication with the hotel manager so got an upgrade to a suite, which probably made a good first impression. The check-in process at the Exec lounge was awesome. Again, applause to the staff! They were well-trained and very very nice. I definitely feel that Diamond member has some value at this property. Stayed here for a whole week and it was great every day. They had a really huge breakfast selections. All type of Thai, Chinese, Indian, western food that I don't think I ate all of them in one week stay. There is a free transit boat to the sky train. The pool was really cool.  It is right next to the newest mall in town, Icon Siam, which is a plus. If I go back to Bangkok, I'll definitely stay here again.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

When I checking in, I ask the high floor and she said okay. I expect the 20 floor cause I can see the floor is available at the app. However she gave me 15th floor and I ask to higher room. She said all the guest should be stayed at 15th floor due to effect of covid19. I really don’t understand cause I already confirm the floor before the visit. I said the app showing that I can check in higher room but she still insist I should stay at 15th floor and it is the highest room where she can provide. Actually this is not my first stay and I visited this hotel 3 times even this year and this is the terrible experience ever. Finally I show her the app and ask to her If I check in at app with 20floor then what should you do. Then she change the room for me. Why she did’t gave the room before I show her the proof. I really don’t understand why she lying to me. From this experience, I don’t know well If I will visit here later.어플에서 높은 층 배정 뻔히 확인되는데도 불구하고 코비드때문에 다른 층 안된다고 거짓말한다. 어플에서 봤다고 하니 킹베드는 없고 트윈베드만 있다고 또 거짓말한다. 어플을 실행시켜서 보여주니 그 때서야 높은 층으로 배정해준다. 직원의 서비스에 실망이다",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

39,5.0,"For our first ever trip to Thailand, our family stayed at the Millennium Hilton for 3 nights during the Chinese New Year period. The service was so good that after returning from the Conrad Maldives, we ended up cancelling our one night stay on 31st Jan originally booked at the Sheraton across the river and stayed again this hotel.I'm both Hilton Diamond and Marriott Platinum so the elite benefits were similar, but the service offered at this hotel during our first stay was just beyond expectations, which meant it was a no brainer to stay here again during our final night in thailand.We stayed in the newly renovated Executive Panoramic Suite, facing north during our first stay and facing south on the second stay. The suites were excellent, clean, decent sized, and both directions had superb views of the Chao Phraya River.The location was perfect, right next door to the ICONSIAM with plenty of dining options along the River. You can exit the east side and also take a complimentary Hilton Shuttle Boat to Sathon Pier, which I did during night time, just to breeze through the scenic river and enjoy the night view. Most of the famous attractions in Bangkok were also situated along the River, so it was very convenient to explore from the Hotel.Dining at the Flow for buffet breakfast and drinks at the Executive lounge (with scenic view balcony) was great with a decent variety of choices. It was quite full during our stay but we didn't have any trouble finding a seat quickly.A big thank you to Meen (HHonor Supervisor) and Robert (Operations Director) for making our stay so memorable. We encountered some initial issues during the reservation stage, but this was quickly sorted out with their help. Personal greetings upon arrival made us feel very welcome and all special requests during our stay were accommodated, from a few tasty mangos, to pre-prepared takeaway breakfast early in the morning before our flight to the Maldives. These beyond expectations services are what really differentiates between the 5-star hotels, the things that we will remember, and bring us back to the hotel in the future!Much have changed in the last few months since our stay, but we hope everyone are safe and well at the Hilton. We look forward to coming back to the hotel, hopefully in the near future.SC",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
40,5.0,Great location for stay and pleasaure. The popular IconSiam with fruitful options of restaurants and shops is connected with  steps away. The highfloor views facing river and IconSiam are especially spectacular both in day and night. The Executive lounge on top of the floors are also cozy and worthwhile.,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
41,4.0,We stayed at this place for 7 nights and decided to change it up halfway through by changing rooms to face the other way down the river and it was great!! We did prefer the side facing the shopping mall and MO but both sides are decent. Try to get the highest floor you can and do check out the top restaurant and bar for some amazing sunset views. Unless you can enjoy the executive lounge as they have similar stunning sunset views! Really one of the best value for Money Hilton’s in BKK and the location along the river and next to a shopping mall is perfect if your going to China town or any Michelin star places. Ohh I almost forget the pool has a super view of the river a great place to have a cold one and get away from the hustle and bustle of BKK. ,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
42,5.0,"We went during the Covid-19 Outbreak, but after conditions were lifted for Local shops, and restaurants to reopen.Like most big establishments taking time to remodel or do some much needed construction. They set up a barrier, and did there best to make sure not to inconvenience any guest who decided to stay at the hotel. Which was very nice, and considerate of the management to think of the guest first. This Resort is located in a very awesome location that has a back entrance where you can access the river front, as well a near by local market where you can eat local food as well shop for some medium priced wears. You can also find fairy access to go across the river to visit the local temple as well.Near by is a SkyTrain station soon to be completed as well the road ways.Current check in times location during the mid-day you check in at the 31st floor, in the afternoon will check in at the front desk. Covid Hours: Check in 12PM - Check out 3PM/15:00Normal Hours: 3PM/15:00 Check in, 12PM Check outYou can always ask to get your bags checked in, as well request early check in or late check out.Tea Time: at a price of 15$ per person, you  get a simple plate of assorted snacks as well fruit, which includes your typical choices of verity of tea, coffees, as well sodas of your choice. Served on the 31 floor of the building which words cannot describe the view that you get of the “Chaophraya” river as well Bangkok city line. Out of the snacks we got the green tea cake was the most delicious out of the whole set.... but might have been to sweet for some individuals. But due to my unique sweet tooth I found it rather tasty. In-Room Dining: Yes a price tag, but the food is worth it.Cesar Salad: Idk if it’s made fresh dressing, but for sure taste like it. If it was not then I for sure would like to know the brand. Very good it also came with some sorted bread making it even more worth it.Raadna Talay: Seafood Thai style noodles the flavor was on another level.Restaurants are limited due remodeling or closed because of previous restrictions set up due to the Virus. So I can find it understandable with the situation, they handle it with pre menu set of Bento boxes set up for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner with 3-5 options with Asian or Western choices that you can select from. The Bentos were amazing from ether the Asian or Western Style the cooks here know how to cook any style meal so far from everything that I have tasted.They really do the best at everything they can to accommodate the guest in any way even in selections. Was really impressed by this. The staff from beginning to the end of our stay was 100% fantastic, very professional, as well courteous of what ever was needed. Rooms are typical set to a U.S price 130$+ pending on which style of room option you like to have for your stay this is only due to the Covid. Rooms on a typical average in the 300$ plus. I do suggest the rooms with a standard or Pano view of the River you will never regret the cost due to the awesome view you get to see with your own eyes.Note: If you getting a Taxi ride be carful, from our experience our driver didn’t want to go through the issues of driving directly into the Resort, assuming due to road construction reasons.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

One things that hard to find in big hotels, the staff was so polite and quiet, I would of thought I was staying in a private villa! The executive floor gives you access to the executive lounge which was beautiful as well! I felt the 2 hour window for happy hour got a little crowded and rushed, but it was very good so I can see why! The pool was great, a little cold, and loved the lounge chairs in the water. The breakfast at the hotel was out of this world! So many choices! I could of spend hours there! The staff went above and beyond to take care of me, and I felt very special!

57,4.0,"Returned to this hotel for a short stay, 10 years after my last visit. The newly renovated Executive Suite was indeed comfortable. However, housekeeping had done a poor job, as the carpets had not been vacuum cleaned  from the previous guests (we found lots of potato chips, clusters of hairs, paper- and plastic pieces on the carpets), making us feel the room was not clean. The room was then serviced once again.Also, the room was very hot throughout our stay (despite adjusting the air con to 70 degrees on full speed). Indeed, we found all the public areas in the hotel to be very hot, especially the Executive Lounge. The staff in the Exec. Lounge were professional and friendly, thank you! However, in spite of offering one of the best views of the Bangkok skyline, I found the furniture to be somehow tired and outdated as well as very uncomfortable. Also, I found the food & beverage offerings to be on the very low side compared to other high end hotels I have frequented in Bangkok during my many visits to the city.Breakfast was a huge disappointment. The variety was huge, but the Egg Benedicts that I ordered were the worst I ever had. The buns were hard as bricks and the eggs were overcooked. My wife did not enjoy her picks as well. HHonors recognition was excellent.All in all a nice hotel, but with the large competition in the hotel market in Bangkok, I have to say that in my humble opinion there are better hotel choices in Bangkok these days for the same kind of money.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Part of the lounge area resembles an I paved car park while the bar is nothing more than fridge and trolley.We weren’t allowed to checkin before 3pm so had a lengthy wait - at 3pm they were having IT issues so we had a further wait while we were assigned a room.Overall it’s suggest avoiding - there’s better hotels for the price range.

We stayed in a Family Suite on the 17th floor for the extra space and were not disappointed.This hotel is situated next to a gigantic newly built shopping mall with multiple food options, although I had the hotel’s own prawn Pad Thai by the pool and it was fantastic. Ah, the pool, in an area on the fourth floor known as The Beach. We spent a few hours there and it was a lovely start to our holiday. You wan walk in a few inches of water between the loungers (and there are enough of these with some underneath gazebos and also some big beanbags available. You can look out to the river below and see (and hear) the many boats passing by. It’s good, as you are high enough to have some peace whilst at the same time there is good visual and hearing stimulation, I think that works really well. The air was surprisingly good there too, but the nice cooling breeze probably helped in that respect.We went up to the jazz lounge on the 31st floor on our first evening, where there was an excellent singer and a talented local band who played requests. It is not cheap there, a Singha beer was £7.50 (so about $10), but I guess you pay for the ambience and the view too, which were both great. The next evening I went up to the outside bar at the top and got some great photos of the sunset at the decommissioned helipad (just above the excellent bar). So for two nights it was a great experience all round.We only had breakfast once, but there is plenty of choice and the smiley chef even introduced himself to us and said if we needed anything to let him know.

They decorated the room really nicely for our honeymoon. They gave us a map of the city and perfectly explained how to get to all the tourist attractions. Walking distance from the new shopping center IconSiam and they tons of stuff in there (indoor floating market, great shops, cool night fountain shows).I would for sure stay here again.

Luggage got lost a concierege, taking an hour to get reolved then disappointed to recieve a hand written additionl  cost  as a I checked in stating that my 5 year old daughter will be charged 700/baht per day for her lounge access, however this was not visible on the website at the time of booking .A very stiff charge for someone who has coco pops for breakfast and some satay skewers and a juice in the evening. A bit of a bitter pill. Only ever had good experiences within the Hilton brand to up to this point being a Diamond member for over 10 years always made things better but not on this occassion.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
67,4.0,"We spent 5 nights at this beautifully situated hotel on the Chao Praya River.  We stayed here several years ago when the shopping and night life were across the river but now the exciting IconSiam center is right next door with shops, restaurants and a fabulous fountain and light show 3 times per evening.  There is a convenient regular shuttle boat to the BTS station. As Diamond members we were given a renovated room on an executive floor.  The room was quite small but functional and had a great view of the river.  Two negatives about the room:  there was no hot water to the sink no matter how long you let the water run and there was a faint smell of sewer at various times during the day and night.  The executive lounge on the 31st floor had stunning views, and good food and beverage offerings.  Breakfast at Flow was excellent with lots of variety and sitting outdoors one could enjoy breakfast whist watching the boats on the river.  Hotel staff did their best to keep the pigeons away from the dining tables.  The gym had a good variety of equipment though the tv function was not working on any of the treadmills, so some updating required there.  We’d definitely stay at this hotel again as it is so conveniently located.  ",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

69,5.0,"We were on Celebrity Millennium that docked for two days at the LAEMCHABANG port, so we decided to stay overnight at the Millennium Hilton in Bangkok.The hotel is located along the Chao Phraya River.  We were picked up by Hilton’s ferryboat at the SP Taksin Bridge.  The boat ride took about 5 minutes.  We were too early for check-in, so we left our luggage at the hotel and went to the shopping complex next door for lunch.  By the time we came back to the hotel, our room was ready.We were on the 14th floor overlooking the river.  The room itself was small but comfortable.  Breakfast was in a large airy restaurant with a lot of international selections.  To visit any of the attractions along the Chao Phraya River, we had to take the hotel’s ferryboat (runs every 30 minutes) back to the Taksin Bridge and pick up the public boat from there.  It was very convenient and cheap.  We paid 20 Baht ($.65) pp to go to the Grand Palace. Millennium Hilton is a beautiful hotel and every staff member we met was attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, we only stayed here for one night so did not get to enjoy the hotel’s many amenities. We would definitely stay longer next time we are in Bangkok.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
70,2.0,"An old property which has become an attractive location due to its immediate proximity to Icon Siam, the latest and best mall in Bangkok. However, its age shows as public areas look out of date. The pool area is a disappointment as its not at all an area to relax unlike other pool areas of similarly rated hotels in Bangkok. The rooms are small. This must be one of the few 4-5 star hotels in Bangkok with no espresso machine in room. There is also no turn down service. The bathroom amenities are of poor quality. Cleanliness is an issue. A cockroach was found in the bathroom. Check-in and out process is slow and with long lines, the process is even slower and not what is expected of this class of hotel. Staff at check-in and out are robotic and process driven and smiles are plastic. Not a pleasant experience for meI would only recommend this location if one needs to be near Icon. Otherwise there are far better options.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
71,5.0,"Stayed here during a short 3 days holiday and loved it. My HHoners status was recognized, and I was given a high floor room with a superb view over the Chao Phyra river.

Breakfast at the main restaurant was great in terms of quality, service and setting. Overall, highly recommended!",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
72,5.0,"The location and the views is what gives this property a resort feel. Nestled between Iconsiam and Khlong San Market on the river with easy connection to various city highlights is its strongest point. Everything else is just icing on the cake.Booked 12 nights using a mixture of cash and Hilton points - 10 nights family suite and 2 nights of Panorama suite (booked what I could find) for 2 adults and our 2 children (ages 8 and 11). Got 6 nights of family suite and 6 nights panorama suite due to availability. This make it being upgraded 4 out of the 12 nights or 34% upgrade rate as a Diamond elite member of the Hilton loyalty program - an accomplishment in my opinion considering that is was the busy season and they are fully booked through the holidays. We thank the hotel management for this generous upgrade. Both suite types were lovely offering panoramic riverside views, elegantly appointed, comfortable beds, great water pressure in the shower even though we were on the 26tth floor, ample toiletries/amenities, espresso machine, Singha bottled water, etc. On two separate nights we watched the fireworks above the river, the bridge, and IconSiam.Executive Lounge: Mediocre F&B but again the views are unbeatable. For alcohol beverages during happy hour, they only serve 4 kinds of non-premium liquor plus beer and wine. They run out of food fairly quickly and they don't replenish timely. They even run out of utensils and the staff seem nonchalant about bringing more out.  Teatime is available for early afternoon snacks and beverages. Seating is available indoors or outdoors with expansive views of the river and Bangkok skyline. Silly that they won't allow guests to sit/use in the circular rotunda between 11 am-5 pm using the excuse that they are cleaning the place. The staff are hit or miss with most are miserable and some are hostile. Despite of the heroic efforts by Khun Nuch and Khun Wink to make us welcome, our time at the lounge was not enjoyable and on the final day we avoided the lounge altogether. Attitude shown by staffers is that guests are burdensome, especially the kitchen guy in the white garb! If it's not included in your rate, I don't recommend you pay for the lounge access.Breakfast at Flow: Great riverside location to have breakfast as the variety, ingredients, the preparations, and the service are all top notch. I have watched the staff manage the waves of guests showing up to partake breakfast and they always performed flawlessly. The buffet fare typical of most top notch Bangkok properties with fruits, salads, cereals & breads, cheeses, cured meats, eggs station with accompaniments, sweets & pastries, noodle station, Thai and Asian foods including Miso soup and assortment of Taki, etc. Would like to give special thanks to Khun Aiws (at the sushi/cheese bar) who went above and beyond the call of duty to make our dining experience enjoyable. The boat ride: the hotel offers a comped scheduled shuttle boat to Sathorn Pier where you can take the BTS (Bangkok light rail system) for easy access to Bangkok's areas of interest. On Christmas day we were dropped off at a pier close to Assumption Cathedral to attend the mass. On the way back, we were fortunate that the hotel manager was in attendance and was gracious to summon the boat back to said pier for a return trip to the hotel. Thank you Khun Josef for your hospitality and concern for your guests.Service was disappointing at the lounge but great elsewhere in this hotel especially at Flow during breakfast, and by management staffers who were very accommodating. We thank Khun Rose and Khun PK for attending to our every need. Not only they set up a Christmas tree for us in the room to celebrate the holiday properly, they also sent us a delicious cake and a bag full of baked goods as Christmas gifts. Thank you so much for your generosity and hospitality. All in all, we highly recommend this property for the accommodating management, the location, breakfast by the river, and the views.",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

Finally, I appreciated the extra effort of Meen who was working at the HHonors desk.

Why must I now be inconvenienced with all the administration to get my money back.  its totally unacceptable the now its my responsibility to sort this out and the Hotel just keep says that the reversal was done and clearly it was not done.For the star rating of this hotel its totally unacceptable and I will NEVER stay again at this hotel",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
80,5.0,"We loved our newly renovated panoramic suite! The decor was fresh and modern, with enough Thai elements in the decor to give the hotel its unique cultural identity. The light-flow was superb and the bed very comfortable, making it a sanctuary in a big vibrant city! The shuttle boat was punctual, and a comfortable, efficient way to get to Saphan Taksin BTS Station, from which we can easily access the rest of Bangkok. If you love malls, Iconsiam is a mere 5-minute walk away! The staff at Flow did an admirable job seating fussy guests during breakfast; they ensured that tables were cleared and coffee topped up promptly. The young gentleman who was assigned to clean my room on the 23rd floor on the 27 and 28 of January, was hardworking and efficient, and he was always so cheerful and positive! Thank you Khun Sy (I hope I remembered his name correctly; management please assist to identify and commend him for us). The Executive Lounge staff were fantastic! Thank you, Khun Enjoy and Khun Ann, for the warmth and hospitality! We also enjoyed a wonderful evening at Three-sixty rooftop bar! The soft-shell crab salad was excellent! Our compliments to the chef! We felt that overall the Millennium Hilton did very well, especially considering that it was the Chinese New Year season, and occupancy was probably near capacity. However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the breakfast could include an on-demand juice station, and freshly cut mangoes, in line with many other 5-star hotels. Secondly, while the offering during happy hour at the Executive Lounge was alright, it was far from the most impressive we’ve had. And finally, we felt that the food options in Three-sixty was rather limited. In many good hotels, the staff would gladly offer to bring you the menus from other in-house restaurants, should you request for something not listed in the menu. On a final note, we had a memorable stay here, but while staying by the river has many advantages, we also like city-centre hotels that offer direct access to a Skytrain station.

83,5.0,"I think The Millennium  Hilton offers the best value for your money in Bangkok.I have stayed here many, many times in the past and consider this my go to hotel in Bangkok.  The personnel behind the front desk are extremely professional and have always been incredibly helpful. There is nothing they won't do to try and accommodate your needs when reasonable. The food in any of the restaurants is spectacular to say the least, not cheap but a cut above. The breakfast is probably the best in Bangkok, in my opinion..They have both Western and Asian options, fruits, salads, pastries and more..I have been coming to BKK for over 15 years. The front desk always acknowledges my status as a Diamond Level member, welcomes me honestly and most recently upgraded me to a panoramic suite on the 15thfloor.This hotel is popular among Japanese and European guests alike...Many tours operate with this hotel in mind..The ""Staff"" members and employees, from Front Desk to Housekeeping, Food Service to Valet are a big reason I return a couple times a year. I have stayed in all The Hilton properties in BKK except The Conrad, thru the years, and this is my favorite...I am moving to The Conrad Bangkok today, for 6 nights..I have high expectations.

The connecting Club rooms were awesome, clean and with all the amenities you need but the best part is the view! Except for a slightly longer than normal wait at Sathorn Pier on one occasion, the free shuttle boat worked out well, really convenient way to access the Sky Train, the river boat taxis and tourist site boats.

Robert the Operations Director was very engaging and gave us some helpful sightseeing tips. The food and sundowners were a gorgeous taste of Thailand and our glasses never went empty. Will definitely stay again and recommend the Hilton Executive room and service at the Hilton Millennium in Bangkok. It is also in one of the best locations in Bangkok what’s not to like!! ,Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5
98,3.0,"I have stayed here a few times now and the lack of consistency in service is what lets this hotel down.This trip I had a exec room reserved and checked in at the lobby where I was expecting to be taken to the lounge to complete the formalities, however, this didn't happen.No recognition of HH status and I was allocated a room adjoining the lift shaft which was incredibly noisy so requested a room change. My profile on my account clearly states a room away from the elevators is my preferred choice, but seemingly ignored.The room itself was fine, albeit a little on the small side, but the view over the river was very good and the soundproofing seemed to be effective.My previous review of this hotel commented on the poor quality of the food and beverages offered in the executive lounge and sadly nothing has changed since my last visit. The view from the lounge is amazing, but the three days I was here, it was overcrowded and not a very relaxing atmosphere. Service was slow and some of the staff gave the impression they didn't want to be there.Food again was mediocre and the wine offered wasn't the best with the food having to be continuously replenished due to the numbers of guests in the lounge.Despite notices clearly stipulating that kids under a certain age not being allowed into the lounge during the drinks service, this was not enforced by staff and totally ignored by irresponsible parents who think it is OK for their kids to run around the lounge uncontrolled and let them poke around the food with their bare hands, although it has to be said that many adults also seemed incapable of using the serving tongs provided.There is a lot of construction ongoing outside the hotel with the new skytrain link causing a lot of disruption. Getting the taxi here was a nightmare and the traffic is horrendous. To compound the problem, traffic accessing Iconsiam gridlocks the surrounding roads during peak hours.I would avoid the area until the construction is complete and easier access to the hotel via the Skytrain is completed.Clearly the hotel must be maintaining its occupancy levels despite the erratic service levels and perhaps they feel that they are fulfilling guest satisfaction expectations.Unfortunately they didn't with this guest!",Millennium Hilton Bangkok Hotel,4.5

It's just not worth the money. I booked 2 rooms on the executive floor hoping to simply unwind and enjoy but alas, with only 2 different ""snacks"" to choose from (both of which were very cold!) and a limited stock of drinks and an uninviting area (very small & cramped I might add) it was such a disappointment we never went back to the lounge.The real plus, though, on the executive floor were our rooms (both corner rooms)! They were spacious and the bathroom had a his & hers basin, a bathtub, a seperate shower room and a separate toilet.If you're simply wanting to enjoy the executive wing and don't care about the executive lounge then go ahead and book it. I wouldn't. Simply because I don't think it's worth the extra money. ",Novotel Bangkok Platinum Pratunam Hotel,4.5

It’s also very easy to get to, as it is accessible to all the 3 train routes. You can even get here by the Airport Rail Link. Not to mention it is also right next to Central World, a major destination. It’s also directly connected to the Novotel Hotel, so if you are staying there, it is as easy as turning left at the reception.The cocktails are reasonably priced. They are priced a bit higher than other places but since you are situated right in the heart of Bangkok (literally next to Central World and to some extent Siam Discovery / Siam Center) it’s reasonable to be charged some extra to get that vibe.I would return again because it’s easily accessible and the atmosphere is great. I haven’t been able to use the pool, unfortunately but I if you are already staying at the hotel you should be able to.Highly recommended.

10,1.0,"First impressions were not the best as trying to unload a packed car along with having a sleeping child in the car. Pulled up to the front and was told by security that could not drive up to front unloading area as an artist was about to leave for concert nearby and that I should wait patiently in the front of the hotel...10 minutes go by and no word. I start to see my parking is causing congestion, so I decide to go park in the parking garage instead, as no big deal, understand a concert is occurring. Fast forward to when I am checking out and my son is having his after non nap. He obviously likes to sleep a lot :) So call down to the front desk and ask them if we can postpone 1 hour on checkout and tell them the little one is sleeping. Put on hold and told, apologies there are a ton of guests going to check in and cannot accommodate the request. We go down to check and do not see these ton of guests that was supposed to be checking in. I tell the person checking out that if I can give a comment that the hotel has no heart and am returned with a slight laugh, smile, and an insincere apologies.If you have children, do not stay here.",Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0

I needed a conveniently located hotel at walking distance from major shopping malls, also a place not too far by taxi from Embassies on the wireless road,. I chose the first time Novotel on Siam because of the location but then i went back several times for the quality of service the beautiful room and efficient Gym and an incredibly courteous, efficient staff crew. the only reservation about ti i might have is that during the months of COVID 19 rates have been very low. If I were to pay full price I might define it a bit overpriced overall",Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0
19,3.0,"We stayed in this hotel because we are a loyal ACCOR Hotel member and because my typical teen daughter wanted a ""shopping"" birthday spree at Siam Square.  Since it was our FIRST TIME in this hotel, we initially booked for 1 night, because we really didn't know what to expect. But..... because the hotel rate was inexpensive, we stated our intentions to the FO Manager during check-in of staying for an additional 2 to 3, depending on my daughter's wishes. Apparently,  we only lasted ONE night. ON-CALL, BEFORE CHECK-IN:3-STAR- I reserved for a room via phone call. That went smoothly and hassle-free! - I asked if we could request a surprise birthday cake for my daughter. The receptionist said they couldn't give us one, even if we paid for it since they needed a 3-day notice. - The receptionist however hinted that they could arrange a birthday surprise when we were already there. - BUT, NOTHING.  Sad.CHECK-IN: 3-STAR- NO welcome drinks. - NO greetings. - NO smiles. - A staff was whispering to another, as though (from an outsider's POV looked like she was ""gossiping"" or not.  - Another lady had a mask but was dangling it from one ear.  ️️THE ONLY PERSON WHO MADE A DIFFERENCE was The FO Manager, Khun Ja. She was very accommodating, gave the proper guidelines on the wifi usage, room no., breakfast time, etc. She also spoke very good English. Sadly, she wasn't present when we checked-out.WIFI:0-STAR -We tried using the wifi, and attempted on several devices BUT RECEIVED ZERO CONNECTION. Junior Suite ROOM:4-STAR- LARGE and LOTS OF SPACE!- has an iron stand and iron- blowdryer- basic toiletries- 2 bottles of FREE water - loved the lighting- 2 large TV sets- very soft sofa bed that we converted into a bed! - loved this!- loved the 2 large chairs!!!- 1 small working desk- safe- 2 pairs of slippers- 2 bathrobes- tons of towels - loved this!- doorbell*Perhaps a center rug may look nice on an almost empty-looking space would do the trick.HOUSEKEEPING:5-STAREXCELLENT! Very quick to respond and very friendly. - I forgot to wear my mask outside the room - a housekeeping staff reminded me in the most friendly and respectful way. - I requested for an extra pillow - received 2 pillows instead, so was rewarded with a generous tip from my husband. BREAKFAST:3-STAR- We were greeted with words and WITHOUT a smile. - We gave our room no. and we ushered ourselves inside since we weren't guided. - No big deal though, since there weren't many inside the restaurant.- The staff were very friendly towards each other, we even saw the Restaurant Receptionist walk hand in hand (fingers interlocking) with the Chef (wearing a black top)- I smiled at all of the staff, who I encountered only to receive blank stares. - Again, no big deal. Maybe, they weren't trained to smile.  And, they were obviously, busy. Except for a lady named ""Khun Pump"" who smiled at everyone and was busy paying attention to all the ""foreign"" looking guests, except for my family who looked very Asian. ️️The ONLY man I would like to commend was the man who had a stroke. HE WAS THE ONLY MAN WHO KEPT A SMILE ON HIS FACE AND WAS ATTENTIVE, DESPITE BEING VERY BUSY!!! Despite the fact, that he only had one active hand (since the other hand had decreased strength and dexterity due to your stroke), he was actively pacing back and forth, making sure that all the areas were clean, checking the food, cooking and cleaning countertops. HE SHOULD BE GIVEN A SERIOUS RAISE!!!! POOL:4-STAR- A very large pool!!!! - My kids and I were happy to have done a lot of lapses here. - Very Very Clean!- OFF POINTS: the pool bar is close, the pool is not ""new' - But, who cares, t'was very very clean!!!  HAPPY-HOUR at the LOUNGE:5-STAR- FREE FOOD and DRINKS!!!- UNLIMITED: Garlic Mussels, Chicken Nuggets, and Fried Wonton Balls- FREE-FLOWING: Pineapple Cocktail and Beer- The Filipino Musicians were awesome! - They received a generous tip from my husband. - The waiters were attentive, warm, and informed us of the ""last call"". - Their awesomeness was rewarded with again, a generous tip from my husband. LOCATION:5 stars!!CLEANLINESS:5 stars!!!LOBBY LOUNGE:5 stars!!!ROOM:4 starsPOOL:4 starsGYM & SPA:didn't pay those a visit GUEST RELATION:3 starsFRONT OFFICE RECEPTION:2 starsDO I SEE THIS PLACE AS OUR SECOND HOME?- Not yet. - Though this place is a far cry from our very loved MERCURE (a hotel we've been going to for the past 10 years), it may still be worth another try. Let's see!!! I WILL DEFINITELY WRITE ABOUT IT AGAIN!!! WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE?- I would actually since I believe that this place may still improve and the location is a plus!",Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0

Some floors are still smoking, which added to the dingy feel.

ALL the staff, from concierge to restaurant to tour serviced to housekeeping -- every single one will bend over backwards to help you. I have turned up way before check-in time, departed way after check-out time, and if a room is not available they always provide somewhere to shower/freshen up; and the lobby sitting area is wonderfully comfortable, with isolated cosy spots that allow comfort and privacy.The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable; with complementary drinking water and tea+coffee makings; kettle and blowdrier.A a female travelling alone, the safety of the area and ease of commute are big deals for me.  The BTS links to the Airport Rail line, and you are literally from the hotel check-out desk to the airline check-in desk in one hour.

We didn’t have to loiter around the hotel area and could freshen up before we went for early lunch.Another special mention was the touch of empathy on their customers. We were supposed to leave on 18 Mar 2020 but due to the border restrictions imposed by my home country due to the covid-19 outbreak, we had to shorten our vacation and leave 2 days earlier than scheduled. The concierge helped us to contact the airlines and tried their best to resolve the matter. Though their attempts were unsuccessful, I appreciate their gd efforts. Just before we left for the airport, we were also impressed by the hotel’s gesture of placing some croissant, danish juices and hot beverages for guests who have to leave earlier than hotel’s official breakfast time. We didn’t have to leave with empty stomach at around 5am in the morning. Novotel Siam Sq has always been my choiced accommodation when I’m in BKK.

Room was adequate. Stayed in 1502. The first night it had a rather unpleasant smell in it. I put it down to the sewage system. Smell disappeared the next day. Bathroom was a little grubby and in need of some maintenance. Bed comfortable and large. Plenty of space and a lovely city view. Good housekeeping. Breakfast was fine.

From the Siam Station, if you prefer not to carry your luggage down the stairs, you could use the escalators in the Siam Square One Mall.  The area around the hotel is a little untidy with motor cycle parking and not completely covered drains.    The hotel lobby has a funky vibe but is looking a little tired.   Our queen room was of a decent size, modern in design,  and most amenities were provided (kettle, slippers, bottled water etc).   The only issue of note was that the room was rather dimly lit though they corrected it by trolleying in a large lamp.  I also appreciated that they remembered my birthday with cake and congratulatory cards – which was a nice touch.Nearby is the Siam Relax Massage (reasonable prices, skilled masseuses) though I can’t vouch for their hygiene practices like cleaning chairs after each client etc.",Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square Hotel,4.0

This made no sense especially with people sharing a twin room. Spoke to the duty manager and they managed to move me another room where the toilet had no issues with privacy the following morning. Appreciate the quick and prompt service recovery. Other than this incident, the stay was great. Location was very near the Siam BTS station (2 min walk) and lots of food options / malls. Siam Paragon was just next to the BTS station and had a supermarket. Overall, I will choose to stay in this hotel again for price and convenience.

Just slow staff. Finally reaching the room, both provided key cards didn't function,and the door could not be opened. Returned to reception, after further ten minutes, I had two new keys, which worked.Due to my status, I received welcome drinks vouchers for the bar. Pretty much to my surprise, I was told, today no beer on stock - can you imagine ? Only imported brands, but those not on voucher. However, next day local beer on voucher was available.Thought over the years, I would know ll the room types, and wouldn't need adapters s three pin sockets be available. However, when doing work, I realized, this room is not fitted with it. Went down to the business centre to get one, and was told, room service would bring one to my room. Nothing during the next 45 minutes. Went down to the business centre again, to get it there. It took the staff there another twenty minutes to get it.The gym is clearly dated. Most of the free weights and machines showing corrosion, though still in usable condition. However, the swiss balls haven't been pumped up for years, and can't be used anymore. Had informed the staff during my previous visit, but obviously to no avail.The room was clean, the bed excellent. But details in the bathroom showing the age too.

The place is in the heart of Sathorn, down a small alley and surrounded by the chaos of the city, not far away from the BTS. The staff was helpful and welcoming, and addressed any problems I had.

However new room whilst much better re windows had a much smaller bed and a shower in a bath which flooded the bathroom every time. The shower broke but again was fixed extremely promptly. No walk-in shower like similar rooms. Air con was very effective. Worst experience was food at the hotel. A group of 24 of us ate the first night. Food was cold.

Also, some of the pictures posted on tripadvisor are wrong, the actual dining room is the one with the orange and blue chairs, not the fancy one with wood chairs and sofas. It's a very standard Hotel, but being clean and quiet it's good value for money.

Secondly, the rooms were old and dirty, our shower wasn’t clean when we checked in, one of the two elevators didn’t work.HERE’S THE WORST OF IT ALL!!!After I checked out, I headed for breakfast thinking all is good, then on my way out the door someone yells after me(mind you it’s 7am and the lobby was filled with ppl waiting for their transportations and some checking out). I walk over to the desk and the guy behind the desk with gloves on is picking out my towels from my room from plastic bag and going through them in front of everyone in the lobby, while telling me that the towels are ruined, they’re dirty. In shock, I told him “they’re towels, I used them of course they’re dirty, that’s your job to wash them” he kept going on about the hotel will need their money and I told them that it was rude to be questioning me about dirty towels in front of all these strangers! Hate to sound spoiled or ignorant but never thought I’d be made to feel embarrassed for using a freaking towel. (FYI, the towel had make up I wiped off on it).

We just wanted to get a taxi from the hotel to Grand Palace. She wanted to sell us a sightseeing package and said that we couldn‘t see the temples without this package. At the end we had to get a taxi on our own. We didn‘t have any problems seeing the temples. And we even needed less money than the package had cost.

54,5.0,"Stayed last December, and now in January. I was surprised with the extra kindness of the hotel staff! They made sure the guests are doing ok. Our room was upgraded with a living room and an extra bedroom. Very spacious. I wanted a kitchen so I can cook simple dishes but only the smaller rooms have a kitchen. I think they should make a bigger gym. It was so small. We had to book at the nearest gym for a month although we stayed in Bangkok for only 10 days. And because we go to the gym, we really need a washer and dryer in the room. They have a laundry space but with only 2 washers and 1 dryer so we had to wait for the others to finish in order to use it. They should provide baskets to put finished laundry just in case the owner doesn't pick their laundry on time so others can use the machine. The pool is very small, too. Don't expect much. They have dry sauna though! Take advantage of their lunch special during weekdays. Ms. Nok Weed was very kind to serve us. Even the cleaning staff did their best greeting us around the hotel. We still have a few more days here and we check out on Monday. Hotel is a 3-minute walking distance from BTS Chong Nonsi station. Very many restaurants around. For the price we paid, it's a great deal!","FuramaXclusive Sathorn Hotel, Bangkok",4.0

The lobby also smells nice & they offer complimentary pandan juice. The room is spacious. For the price that we paid for, we were not expecting a huge 1-bedroom suite with a living room & another large TV apart from the one in the bedroom. There's also 2 airconditioning units, 1 in the bedroom & 1 in the living room. Plenty of storage space, too. The other room that we got, on the other hand, is a studio type with a kitchen & large refrigerator. Complimentary bottled water is replenished everyday.We were also satisfied with their service. Everyone was very nice, accommodating, & helpful. Breakfast buffet is practically the same everyday & selection is not that many but it's good enough. I love the beverage options. I personally think that it's not centrally located but there are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity, as well as massage salons. Patpong/Silom night market is also walkable. It's easy to get a ride, either through Grab or taxi. The hotel also offers taxi service & tours. Most tourist spots & some shopping centers can be reached in 15 minutes by car/taxi, depending on the traffic. Didn't try the train as we had a senior citizen in our group but it might be faster & more practical to use. The train station is also walkable from the hotel.","FuramaXclusive Sathorn Hotel, Bangkok",4.0

In case you are sick of breakfast, there is a local stall near the hotel selling Chicken rice. There is also a MacDonalds.The room is run down and very simple. The ""Do Not Disturb"" button is not working and the toilet door badly designs. The hotel counter can't help you if you want to change money to smaller notes. To be honest, I am very disappointed. Tried two times and they always can't help. So I got to spend money to break the notes at the convenient stall.","I Residence Hotel Silom, Bangkok",4.0

As most of the reviewers wrote, location is just excellent, right next to BTS Chong Nonsi. Check in was quick and easy, staff were helpful and smiling. Rooms were spacious, but basic, definitely not up to 4 star rating. The whole place is a mixed bag: good sized rooms, good staff, perfect location versus disorganized breakfast (empty food containers on the table), messy, uncleared areas...","I Residence Hotel Silom, Bangkok",4.0
23,3.0,"This hotel has great location. Is right in front of Chang Nonsi skytrain station, across the street from King Power Maha high rise building and surrounded by restaurants, street food and cafes.The pool at the 10th floor is a great addition. Is not too big but it has a nice view and is perfect for when you want to cool off after spending few hours walking the streets of hot and humid Bangkok.The room we had was clean and big enough. I liked that the AC was not blowing directly over the bed so we could sleep with it on.Now to the negatives: breakfast is terrible. Plenty of Asian choices, but if you are not into rice and noodles for breakfast, you are pretty much left with eggs, bread, jam and butter. One day would not be terrible, but if you stay longer and like Western breakfast, consider other places for the first meal of the day.Service is terrible! Reception speaks very little to no English, and the concierge gives bad or wrong advices.Their prices for laundry are ridiculous (70 USD for 3 kg of T-shirts, underwear, pants...), so we asked for cheaper alternatives. The concierge recommended us another hotel. We carried our things there and...surprise: that hotel had always accepted laundry from their guests only. Back to I Residence, I told the concierge he gave us a bad advice and he barely acknowledged it, let alone apologize.All in all, is an OKish hotel. Just have breakfast somewhere else and ask Google, instead of the staff, for any advice you need.","I Residence Hotel Silom, Bangkok",4.0

27,4.0,"I just loved staying here, i stayed a total of 15 days which is unusual for me as im a traveler and spend most of my time traveling. Unfortunately, i was not able to give the hotel five stars for two issues which i really think they should correct... One, the room has no dark shades to prevent light from coming in. Second, the noise from the busy street and train station clearly comes in (we were on the 8th floor).On the positive side everything else is perfect including the lobby receptionists, the door men, both night and day were so delightful to come and see each time we returned from a long day of sightseeing, the morning car porter was also someone i looked forward in seeing every morning as he always wanted to talk to us (super friendly), the cleaning lady always did a great job even when we didn't activate our ""make the room"" light notification and finally the lady Kob that works with the booking of tours was so friendly even thou we didn't purchase any tours with her.....Thank you all for my wonderful 15 days of stay!!","I Residence Hotel Silom, Bangkok",4.0

38,5.0,"What I love in this hotel:Just below BTS (Chong Nonsi Station)Affordable - below 3k per night for a spacious room with buffet breakfast for 2.Breakfast buffet has many choices - from rice meals, to noodles and pasta, fruits, salad bar, omelet being cooked upon order, all kinds of bread and spreads (orange marmalade is present!), they also have ham, pork, chicken, siopao, soup/porriage and cereals for kids (I eat lots of koko krunch). Of course coffee, tea, hot choco, were present too. just don’t like much the waffle it was not fluffy.Housekeeping - they replace towels everydayStaff - very accomodating and polite. I saw a review that staff there are rude, but in my experience, it’s not true. Even the bell boy was funny and entertaining. I also appreciate the receptionist who assisted me during check in, she talked slowly like she’s ensuring I understand her. Thai people I encouter were a little bit hard to understand because of their accent in speaking in english. I appreciate the receptionist while talking to me. I just forgot what was her name :(Power plugs are everywhere - i don’t need to bring extension cords to charge all my devices all at the same time.Wifi connection is fast. Forgot to check the mbps though.They have hair dryer and mini ref.What i don’t like was, just the waffle on the breakfast buffet, no dresser and slippers. These are all manageable and can easily be fixed. I bought my own slippers and used the toilet mirror.Surely I will return to this hotel when I return to Thailand again.","I Residence Hotel Silom, Bangkok",4.0
39,2.0,"The pool was very nice with a great view of the tallest building in Bangkok and you can see all those people walking out onto the glass floor at the top of the building (eeks) - pool was a bit cool for me but still a great cool down at end of day.However, that is where it stops. The breakfast buffet, while it looked not bad, was cold every morning which I found very odd considering we were the first ones there every day - buffet staff were disinterested; resorted to the omelette bar to get something hot; fruit looked like the day before’s on a couple morns.Rooms definitely don’t look like the website; shower was cold or luke warm at best and could hear the guy snoring in the next room. The hallway rugs don’t look like they have seen a shampooing for a while.Bellmen were very helpful and always pleasant.

46,1.0,"I usually do not write bad reviews but for the sake of others, I just had to.The name of the hotel is i Residence but booking this location for my stay with my significant other in Bangkok was something that I regret. In fact, this was the only hotel in all my years of travel that made me check out soon after checking in.When we reached the lobby of i Residence, located in the basement next to the carpark, I didn't know what to expect. Checking in was a breeze and we were given a pair of keycards. Unknown to us, this was the beginning of our problematic stay here, as we had been given the old ""insert in"" keycards despite the suite door being installed with the new tap-only lock system. Due to this, we had to take the elevator back down and be re-issued new keycards which the counter staff failed to program correctly. As such, we had to go up to to the room's floor and down back to the lobby thrice before we even got to enter the room.The room was rather dank with cracked floors, a stained sofa and a double bed which was actually 2 twin beds sharing a large bedsheet with a depression in the middle due to bad alignment. We took comfort in the fact that the location was close to the city but made a mental note that the price we paid could have gotten better lodging. As we lay on the bed watching the decent selection of television channels, we started to feel itchy and uncomfortable. It was only then that I realised that that despite me killing 4 bugs in the first 30 minutes of entering the room, the number of bugs lurking around had barely decreased.Out of nowhere, a hotel staff burst into the room after a barely audible knock, declaring that our room was due for checkout. Funny how this had happened given that we had just checked in less than 1 hour ago and he was the same guy that had assisted us in opening the room door due to the previously mentioned keycard fiasco. As sudden as his entry, he muttered an apology saying that he got the wrong room number and rushed out without even closing the door, leaving us stunned and appalled at what had just happened.My significant other and myself looked at each other at disbelief with regard to our overall experience at i Residence thus far. As we started to discuss, we noticed another bug flying casually across us and decided that was it. We repacked our belongings and went down to check out immediately, letting the counter staff know what had happened, to which we were met with indifference. As such, I am lead to believe that incidents like these are not uncommon at this hotel.To those who have booked or are planning to book this as your place to stay, best you think again on whether you are willing to sacrifice privacy, hygiene, and comfort  just for slightly better access to prime locations in Silom.","I Residence Hotel Silom, Bangkok",4.0

58,4.0,"My last stint at this hotel was say dispiriting. I promised not to visit despite being in a commendable location and value for money. However I throw in the towel as I was too lazy to search for another and wanted to be in Silom area without getting back to my previous accomodation.So, fast forward 2 yearish... And things are looking good. My pet peeve of no tolerance for bad service was assuaged when the varied staff I met during this stay provided  gracious hospitality. Had breakfast and though they were nothing to wow about, for the minimal added price to the room's rate was definitely good value. There was a Major renovation going on at the room 809 (was staying 808) but these guys had to do what they had to do to keep the place in good fashion. So in spite of the disturbances, it wasnt that big of a deal.One cavaet, rooms at least the one I stayed has super thin walls so be weary if you are a light sleeper.Side alleys has wondrous galore of food.

When it became ready, we discovered that the room internet rarely works with the connection really bad as if it does not reach our room (Room 407), the beds are stiff as wood and very uncomfortable, the toilet door does not close, and many other unpleasant issues.We were surprised to find this at a hotel like yours.

64,4.0,"This hotel has a great location - right at the Chong Nonsi BTS stop with an escalator up to the trains, across the street from Lek Seafood, around the corner from a super hamburger place and just a short walk to The Unnamed coffee/sandwich shop.  Street food is just a few steps away and nightlife along Silom is within walking distance.  The rooms are acceptable but there was some noise from hotel construction during the day.  Walls are thin so one can hear neighbors shutting doors but voices cannot be heard.  Housekeeping was good with fresh towels and clean bathroom; shower was hot and worked well.  Breakfast buffet was okay but less tasty than others that we have experienced.  Decent selection of Thai and western food - made to order omelets and selection of breads.  Disappointed in the salad options, lack of bacon, and the bland taste of the food.  Service was good.  Beautiful pool area especially at night, but the gym is a joke with only two machines.

Initially, I have requested to one of their gents staffs and as a favor he took the print for us & then this new lady whom I haven't met before on my 2 days stay suddenly got those printouts from him & was asking us to pay 60 baht for the printouts. I told her that he did not specified anything on this & just for 4 sheets of A4 we were asked to pay 60 baht..? she replied ""even I can throw these papers but without paying 60 baht I will not issue these printouts.""

Sure, not everyone's experience during their stay here is going to be the same but I think you'd really have to be searching for something to criticize to not enjoy yourself. The rooms were spacious and decorated in modern chic. The gym is fully functional proper gym. The pool is a rather nice size and presents a very comfortable area to lounge around. I thought the food was above average overall. The staff is terriffic- gym-side, poolside, in the restaurant, the housekeeping team, and the front desk staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful and always greeted guests with a smile. My most frequent interactions were with Mild, Chat, and Art at reception.

Had no problems getting breakfast which was included with our room package. Not in the middle of the city center but that suited us with a 3 year old in tow. Heaps of good food in Union Mall.

56,3.0,"Very good location, near MRT and BTS, new hotell. Good breakfast, but I am not totally happy with the service:After finding out that our bathroom and toilet was not cleaned, took pictures and went down to the reception to complain, asked a boy there that I wanted to talk to the manger, he told me that he is not here, what can I help you with?I told him the story that when I came back to the room after a long day in town and putting on the cleaning sign, putting the towels on floor (as a sign that you want a new one as told in the hotell card) I see that its not cleaned and I have still the old towels just folded with the same dirt on them. He said ok sorry I will tell the manager and tried to look away.I don't know what's going on, but I expected that he came with the solution, but no.Then I told him what now? can you get some one to fix this. after that he turned backh and said ok.what is this? I don't need to ask for this, He should come up with solutions.Next I asked for a Thai massage service that they had with a A4 ad and price list , it was full booked for now they said, but they could fix this next day at 11:00. guess what nobody showed up the next day after waiting and changing of day plan. After another complain, they arranged for 20:00. the lady showed up 20:10 finally.By the way, never saw that they clean the room floor.I don't know why this happened, but I expect dem to be more professional.Never heared from the manager.","The Quarter Ladprao by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
57,5.0,"This hotel is great, not only is it super reasonably priced for the service and amenities on offer/ location, but the overall feel of the hotel is that of a quality hotel.  I loved the gym, the pool and the restaurant, and of course the room was great.I am a bit of a conservationist, so I don't really like wasting material things.. This is why I was happy to see that the shower gel, shampoo and soap were all refillable.   This was great, because there was no waste in product packaging (also the three items were quite luxurious, made from really nice ingredients, that didn't dry my skin or hair at all).The front desk staff are really friendly and helpful.  I stayed for about 10 days in all so I kind of lived there a bit, Som in particular was so helpful.  She helped me plan where to go, how to get wherever I needed, and just general pleasant conversation, which I really appreciated.  All the staff did as much to make my stay as comfortable as possible. There was one funny incident (the first 3 days when I stayed on a different floor before moving).  There were two really loud women that were shouting/ talking at around 1-2 am.  I guess this sometimes happens (it's Bangkok) so maybe they were just rowdy from the night.  Apart from that all the guests were classy and kept noise to a minimum, or just enjoyed themselves without causing trouble to me or anyone else. All in all, a great place to stay, just outside the blue line (MRT) line, you get off at Phahon Yothin exit number 1 (this is incidentally the connecting station for the green BTS line, which is a 10 minute walk along the skywalk/ on the road/ or via the the mall if you go before the mall closes (at 10pm).  It's 1 minute outside exit 1 of the MRT line.  Very convenient.There's a 7-11 outside, which is great for all your daily essentials, well priced.For washing, I would recommend going to a launderette down the road (it's a 10 - 15  minute walk), on Soi 18, walk out the hotel, go on the main road and turn right, and continue walking for 10 -15 minutes, the launderette is called White Rabbit (costs about 40 baht for a wash/ 40 for a tumble dry etc).  Open at usual times of the day, and no queues when I went twice in the evenings.The food at Hilly's/ room service is so good.  I advise ordering the Thai dishes, they are so yummy and healthy.  I would avoid the western dishes (not many on the menu, but if you're in Thailand you may as well eat Thai food, you can eat your normal food when at home !).","The Quarter Ladprao by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

They even give you welcome drink coupons that we later used at the restaurant. Deluxe room is definitely worth it. It is much bigger and nicer. We requested a quiet room on a high floor. That is exactly what we got. Our room was on the 12th floor facing a quiet alley. The view from the balcony was amazing at all hours of the day. Smart TV, comfortable bed, clean bathroom with the necessary toiletries, fridge, umbrella, safe, hangers and tea, coffee, water stocked daily, etc., everything we possibly needed was provided. The rooms are cleaned very well daily. The breakfast buffet is yummy with many choices. Every staff we met was super nice and always greeted us with a smile. The pool and the gym are very clean and nice. Poolside chairs and bean bags are perfect to lounge around on. During the evening they turn on the lights around the pool, and it looks so freaking romantic.Also bonus points, 7 eleven is right outside and MRT station is literally 1 minute walk. If you are taking the MRT get of at the Phahon yothin station! We got of at Lat phrao station and had to take a taxi to the hotel.

After I read the TA reviews and saw the incredible prices for the Quarter Silom, I booked using their website.    Check in and out were positive experiences as staff easily communicated in English.    But the reception area is small so I can see that it might get hectic with large groups.     Further, the parking situation is limited for but it’s easily accessible via the BTS or Grab car.   As mentioned the property is new so the room furnishing are very nice and there are plenty of outlets for devices.    They also have mood lighting which was a fun touch.     The bed and bedding are good quality and it was easy to fall asleep quickly.  Strong consistent wifi throughout the room and property; as well as a good AC system.    The shower pressure is strong and there was plenty of hot water.    The room also had a kettle, mini fridge, and microwave.   The hotel offers an inexpensive breakfast including Western and Thai offerings.   Overall the buffet was just ok and this would be an area that they could easily improve.       The property also has a well equipped fitness center including wet and dry saunas.    There’s also a small pool.      Overall - a very positive experience especially given their low rates.

The staff are all friendly and service-minded from security, front desk, bellboy and housekeeping. Thank you! The only thing that disturb me is noise from neighbors since wall is quite thin I guess .. There are some shouting & crying children... Anyway, still worth every single penny and will absolutely come back!!","The Quarter Silom by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",5.0

25,5.0,"Another Bangkok staycation - so I decided to check out a new property in one of my favorite neighborhoods, Silom.     After I read the TA reviews and saw the incredible prices for the Quarter Silom, I booked using their website.    Check in and out were positive experiences as staff easily communicated in English.    But the reception area is small so I can see that it might get hectic with large groups.     Further, the parking situation is limited for but it’s easily accessible via the BTS or Grab car.   As mentioned the property is new so the room furnishing are very nice and there are plenty of outlets for devices.    They also have mood lighting which was a fun touch.     The bed and bedding are good quality and it was easy to fall asleep quickly.  Strong consistent wifi throughout the room and property; as well as a good AC system.    The shower pressure is strong and there was plenty of hot water.    The room also had a kettle, mini fridge, and microwave.   The hotel offers an inexpensive breakfast including Western and Thai offerings.   Overall the buffet was just ok and this would be an area that they could easily improve.       The property also has a well equipped fitness center including wet and dry saunas.    There’s also a small pool.      Overall - a very positive experience especially given their low rates.

15,5.0,"This hotel is conveniently located about 10 minutes walk from the Sala Daeng BTS and Silom Road, or the hotel provides a shuttle service during the day. The reception staff were efficient and friendly. We booked a Premier One Bedroom which was extremely good value. The room has a kitchen with fridge, stove, micro wave, with plates abd utensils. If you need anything else for the kitchen just call Housekeeping. There was a sofa and coffee table and a good sized flat screen TV, as well as a desk and lamp.The bedroom has a comfortable bed, safe, and wardrobes. The bathroom is a good size with toiletries provided. Basically it is a serviced apartment. We didnt have a view, just the building nextdoor, but higher up you would, or at the front or rear of the building (we were on the side). We didn't have breakfast, but there was a promotion going which made it more than reasonable. There is a very good gym, and an ""L shaped"" pool that wraps around the rear of the building. The pool is deep compared to many Thai pools, and refreshingly cool. We had an issue getting the channels on the bedroom TV. We rang reception and someone came up and fixed it in 5 minutes. All requests to reception were handled promptly. Parking is available. Like a lot of Thai carparks the headroom appears low, however we have a huge 4wd car and managed to park without any problems. The rooms are spotlessly clean. If I were looking for something to criticise I would say that some of the furnishing is getting a bit worn, but not to the extent that it looked bad or I wouldn't want to stay there. I would say given the very reasonable price for the room (and there were several room types cheaper or dearer for that matter), the size of the room, 2 TV's, cleanliness, the kitchen, pool, and parking--that Siri Sathorn is a hotel I would happily stay in again.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

26,4.0,"Staff were very helpful and supportive (Excellent services), breakfast was great, a lot of variety and good taste. We booked at very cheap rate but we got spacious room.Need improvement on air-con system which was difficult to control temperature, too cold.., housekeeping standard should be improved, amenities were not well-prepared, no vaccuming on daily basis. Room design was not practical, no sofa bed in the living room for main family room. ",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5
27,3.0,"I booked this hotel because I have been here twice to visit my friends who stayed here ; the room is very good although the air-conditional is loud.  However,  my personal experience with the staff has been more than dissatisfaction.  When I first requested two additional bottles of drinking water, I was told the usual practice is two bottles only.  I seriously cannot understand the big deal of giving two more bottles.  Would that cost the hotel a bomb?  Or is the hotel worried that every guest would demand for two additional bottles?  If there is a convenient shop nearby I would not have bothered to ask for additional drinking water, but there is no 7/11 or whatsoever nearby.  Later when I requested for late check out at 14:00pm on 25th October (tomorrow), I was told that the hotel is full on 25th October hence it is impossible to let me check out at 14;00, and I have to be out at 13:00.  I came back to the room and purposely check Agoda only to find out that roomS (not two or three, but at least five, unless Agodo is lying too) are still available tomorrow.  Lying would not get you anyway, and I believe your hotel needs to retrain your reception staff.  Especially when they see guest standing at the counter, while another colleague was attending to another guest over the phone, your staff ignored the one at the counter and continued to look for things in the steel cabinet.  Probably because I am an Asian, not a farang, hence I have been given such treatment.  A disappointment indeed.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

30,4.0,"I booked a very particular type of room (1 BR designer suite as i used to stay there before) which upon arrival, it was not the same as picture i saw (nor pictures i took on my last trip) on booking website. so i asked to change the room but they said room is being cleaned, at 2 pm, i asked to see the room first to make sure it is the same room i booked, surprisingly, it was not and room was a complete mess. Manager was called, and she was very nice and all, she quickly solved the problem and we finally got to the room we booked originally at around  3 pm. But at the point, i was so hungry i almost faint, luckily, the manager called up to check if the room was ok and offer us free meal from kitchen, save me from hunger. Food was ok, nothing great, but suffice our hunger (as well as anger). Room was great, spacious, clean, hot water is hot, AC is cool, everything function properly. Bed was soft (my friend said too soft but i was so tired, i didn't care), pillows were nice. TV was working well. Safa smell a bit but acceptable. Internet is great. View is a lot better than room on opposite side of corridor. There was construction going on but not so loud, so we were fine. Our night went smoothly. BF was good, but slow on refill. They have small oven so i can reheat croissant, love that! Swimming pool and gym are great. Love the morning swim (only me in the pool) but the construction of building next door is a bit worrying. at one point, crane was lowing big piece of something and i was thinking, please don't drop it over my head. Parking was a bit of a hazard, or maybe i'm just not a good driver. Location is great with everything on walking distance (know this from map, i didn't have strength to explore on arrival).

The staff was very friendly, the food at the restaurant was really good. Unfortunately, the room was DISGUSTING. Every time I entered the room, my allergies flared up and I spent several miserable nights trying to sleep. Additionally, 75% of the horizontal surfaces covered in fabric contained ""stains"" of the biological variety. It made it very difficult to relax in bed, or on the sofas, or window seats. We attempted to contact management about our concerns during our stay, and were never contacted. My husband, my daughter and I could've chosen much better for much less. I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

Our room was enormous and had a kitchenette although we didn't really use it a lot as there are loads of nearby eating options - though the fridge was certainly very useful. The ensuite shower/bathroom was nicely appointed and always plenty of hot water. Only had breakfast on our first morning - it was very good with a huge choice, just didn't feel we needed a big breakfast with all the food options Bangkok has on offer. The staff are all lovely and the doorman in his traditional costume was unfailingly jolly, and the room was kept very clean with fresh towels every day. Good aircon (essential), not too noisy  though not as quiet as the very most modern.

I was happily  surprised to discover that my room (a junior suite) was available and ready. I paid and ... things changed immediatly. The lady at the counter, without mentioning that before, told me that I cannot get the room until 12pm unless I pay an additional amount ! What kind of policy is it if not racket ? I can easily understand to wait until 12pm or even 2pm when rooms are not available but it wasn't the case. Forgot to mention that I, and my wife too, used to stay for long periods at Siri Sathorn.

46,4.0,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our Thailand trip. The location suited us as a family with two kids - it's reasonably quiet as it seems to be surrounded by other hotels, serviced apartments and office blocks with the bonus of being able to walk to both the BTS (Sala Daeng) and MRT (Silom), which meant we didn't need taxis to get to where we want.  The hotel provides a free shuttle every 30 mins (do check when they begin and end though) to either of these places if you don't feel like the 10 minute walk. On the walk to the BTS station there is an outdoor food centre which has all sorts of interesting stalls, try get here before or after the lunchtime rush where lots of office workers come and eat.  Next to the BTS station is Silom Centre which has a TOPS supermarket under ground level if you want to stock up on breakfast supplies etc.  We booked the 2 bedroom deluxe suite, which was very spacious and clean. The complimentary fruit platter at arrival was much appreciated. It is a bit dated but we didn't mind. The most important thing was that it was quiet and the blinds did actually block out the light so we all slept well. Showers are a bit ""temperamental"". You can't adjust them after the water has started running or else it runs very hot, or very cold.  We found that it was best if you turn the tap on in the middle, let it run for a few minutes, and if you need to adjust, do that, and leave it on for a few more minutes so it has ""time "" to adjust? Some staff are fantastic (special mention to Kart who was always very cheery and another gentleman who opened doors for us but sadly I forgot to note his name), some aren't great (one lady hung up on me when i called).The pool was very nice as was the gym.

I Adjusted abit to the hot side and I becomes way too hot, adjust a bit to the cold side and it becomes way too cold and when it's perfect, even when you don't touch it, it turns it's temperature to be too hot.

71,3.0,"This is my third stay here which might suggest I have no complaints. Certainly, the location is great (I usually stay in Sathorn/Silom); rooms are spacious if dated; there’s an ok outdoor pool and a very decent gym/fitness centre. But even though it is good value, there’s something missing, at least compared to other hotels with a similar price point and location (Eg: Bandarra Suites, literally across the road).So what’s lacking? First, I’m ok with rooms that are a bit dated (I loved the Dusit Thani, sadly now in the process of being demolished). But SS seems to have a bit of a mould problem; in some rooms there’s no  power point anywhere near the bed to plug in your phone charger etc; and the toilet paper consists of annoying single squares -surely we’re adult enough to have a proper roll of toilet paper. I also don’t get that when you book a room through an aggregator such as Agoda, and specify ‘non smoking’ you get an email from the hotel saying they can’t guarantee a non smoking room. When you press them in reply they confirm a non smoking room, but why have to go through all this to get there? Staff are generally friendly, some are terrific ( doormen, porters restaurant staff, maids ) but others seem a bit jaded indifferent, just going through the motions. But what has irked me most after three stays, and will mean I will think twice about staying again, is a rigidity or policies and rules that don’t make much sense. Ok, I wasn’t allowed to keep in my room the corkscrew I’d asked for; ok I wasn’t allowed to take my included breakfast coffee up to my room but was told if I did that I’d have to pay for it -as if it was room service even though I wasn’t asking anyone to bring it to my room. But the final straw was when I did order a glass of red wine to my room, and realised it was ‘corked’ and undrinkable. I asked for a replacement from a fresh bottle but was told that wasn’t possible. Instead, the room service guy came back to collect the glass of wine and show me a piece of paper that confirmed my order had been canceled. Surely it would have been easier to just ‘accept the customer was right’ and send up a fresh glass?The overriding attitude seems to be ‘can not’ rather than ‘can’. So, now I’m across the road at Bandarra Suites and, two nights in, no complaints. I have a business suite which is ridiculously spacious and has sweeping views over Lumphini Park. There are two pools, friendly staff, a good gym, a coin op laundry. My room rate doesn’t include breakfast but I can get it day by day for a very reasonable  299 baht (about A$14).So, next time I’m in town and looking for great value for money accommodation, I think I’ll be pulling out my iPhone and say ‘Siri, take me to Bandarra Suites’.",Siri Sathorn Bangkok by UHG Hotel,4.5

49,5.0,"I was stranded in Bangkok for over a month as my airline wasn't flying during the covid-19 pandemic. I was fortunate to to find the Evergreen Place Hotel. Excellent location in central Bangkok; 3 minute walk to BTS, ten minute walk to MBK, Siam Paragon, Hard Rock Cafe, Jim Thompson House, etc. The service at the Evergreen is exceptional for a hotel rated as 3 stars. Everyone here is very service minded.  It seems unfair to point anyone out but Ae in the restaurant and Nice in the fitness center were exceptional.  Warm, friendly smile every day. But everyone is great from the door men to the front desk to the restaurant staff to the housekeeping staff. Even the owner, who occasionally has breakfast in the restaurant, is warm and friendly.  Excellent fitness center. Great swimming pool. Free on-site parking  This hotel is in reality a serviced apartment. 4 star service at a value price. Highly recommended.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

52,5.0,"we stayed at evergreen our first night in Bangkok. This is not the fanciest place but it had what we needed for our family. we had a 2 bedroom suite with a kitchenette and livingroom. it was quiet enough for us to get over our jet lag. The receptionist were super friendly and helpful. if you have the option to have breakfast included....DO IT! The food is so delicious and something for everyone. You can walk right out front and get a foot massage or hit up the seven eleven for snack or check out the food vendors out front. my impression  was New York city on steriods...it was great! if you need a taxi, the concierge will get you one. need to book a tour? there's someone for that too. we booked a tour and had the best day and saw the grand palace, river tour and so much more.

A lot of waiting.- Our room was very nice, however too little space for baggage etc, and there was no desk.- The breakfast was good, but a bit boring for this hotel - expected a bit better. :/Would recommend for the room, pool and for sure the LOCATION!","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

The hotel is luxurious, the breakfast buffet is just like a dream for a foodie – so many things to try, plenty of fresh exotic fruits, delicious local dishes and the good old European options... The pool is a bit cold, but the gym is v very nice! The staff is polite and extremely helpful. The transfer to the airport is a bit pricy, but that’s not exactly related to the hotel. Our wonderful apartment consisted of two rooms, and it was so comfortable, at first we didn’t want to go out at all)) Though we did in the end, because the hotel has a perfect location for exploring Bangkok - walkable distance to all the best malls like The Platinum Fashion Mall. The tube station is also just two steps from the hotel. And the street it is located on has plenty of cosy little local places to eat, as well as a Seven Eleven.

Last night I went down to order a taxi to driver me to the DMK airport for today. I was standing there for maybe 1 hour or so just talking to Sein and Next. We laughed and laughed and had a very great time. I think this is the best you can give a customer. Next has only been working for you for 2 or 3 months but she is really competent and has a unique way to make a guest feel welcome. You should cherish her because she will grow and only become better. She's one of a kind. Sein help me to check in when I came 5am in the morning. He had a big smile and is very friendly and he really tried of I could check in so I didn't had to wait until 2pm. He did everything he could, and kept saying sorry even though is was not his fault but mine that I came so early. He is a very humble guy who is a manager and has only been with you since August 2019. He is a keeper! Thank you so much!

64,4.0,"Chose this hotel as it’s a 5 min walk from our son’s condo and as we were staying 14 nights it proved to be easy walking distance from BTS, Siam and Platinum district (from where we usually stay).  However, we booked a superior room which was adequate for a few nights but no where to store clothes ie no wardrobe space if you are staying longer.  Bathroom was a good size but towels were well worn and although clean need replacing soon room had a nice large bed and excellent bed linen and very comfortable with efficient a/c. Lacking a well placed sockets in fact the only one we could use was under to shelf so had to take the kettle into the bathroom (only twice did housekeeping replenish 2 tea bags).Room was clean but in sadly need of refurbishment and balcony needs a deep clean, pool area proved to be quiet during our visit but probably a few more sun beds would be useful at busy times the pool and gym staff were friendly and welcoming.With the exception of the two porters and the duty manager the female staff need coaching in customer service, they were rude and extremely unhelpful particularly when we checked out.  Where is the famous Thai smile it certainly wasn’t at the Evergreen last 2 weeks.Although we had a couple of issues we would return as its such a convenient  location but but upgrade to a deluxe room or above in future.  We didn’t eat in the hotel as it just didn’t appeal and considering we stayed for 14 nights the staff with the couple of exceptions already mentioned were quite off hand.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5
65,4.0,"We booked 2 deluxe room and was upgraded to a 2-room suite which was good for us. As with our numerous stay in this hotel over the past few years, it was pleasant and when without any issue.

Moreover, we did not see any of the long-serving staff anymore.","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

We returned after 2 hours and found a clean and comfortable room, dated and chipped but with a bathtub and an opening window.

The balcony, which was our main reason for booking, was impossible to sit in. They put no less then 5 condensers in it, so it’s hot chocking air on you face and always very noisy. The staff response for that was that “It’s a common thing in every hotel”. WTF? No costumer service awareness.Breakfast is somewhat between average to poor, pool is poor, looks much better in photos.

Also walking distance from the Siam boat station. Located close to lot of eateries. Has a massage place, 7/11 store and lot of street food being sold right outside.

73,4.0,"The Evergreen Place Siam in Bangkok was a neat and tidy hotel with friendly staff. The room was quite big and had a small fridge, microwave, kettle, and cook top, the decor was a little dated but it was fine. Location: The MBK Centre was a 10 min walk away, and the hotel is very close to the Ratchathewi Station, about 1 min walk. There is an awesome dining precinct right across the road called Coco Walk with several great, affordable Thai restaurants and bars. I recommend one in there called Thai Town, the food was excellent and drinks were strong. As it's a big main road, it's best to go to the Ratchathewi station, go up the big stairs, across, and down the stairs on the other side, in order to cross the road. There is a Massage place next to the hotel driveway which does Thai massages but we didn't think they were very good, our backs actually felt more sore afterwards, I wouldn't recommend that one.Facilities: The hotel has an outdoor pool on the 8th floor with sun lounges, its not a big pool but it's fine. The gym was good, it looks small but it actually has a lower level and rooms behind it with a boxing studio, and toilets with lockers and showers. The gym has free weights, lots of machines with cable weights, treadmills and fit-balls, and provides towels and water.Breakfast: The breakfast buffet was good, it had a mix of western and asian foods and lots of healthy options as well, and an omelette station. Shopping: Definitely check out the MBK Centre which has a bit of everything and has lots of food places to eat at, and good public toilets. There's alot of bargains, some will do bartering, souvenirs, and fashion for men, women, and kids as well. Another good Mall for fashion is Platinum Fashion Mall, it has a huge amount of awesome unique designs for women, kids and men, but mostly women are the main ones here, less bartering and more fixed prices, higher prices but better quality. Transport: A taxi to the airport is around 250-300 baht, and a Tuktuk to Platinum Fashion Mall is around 100 baht. Enjoy!! ","Evergreen Place Siam by UHG Hotel, Bangkok",4.5

Nice bathroom too, and everything just works perfectly.The best part of the stay were the staff though, some of the friendliest and most attentive I ever met. Especially the Korean lady at reception, Ester. She remembered my name from day one and even when I came back after a few months with no booking, just a walk in, she remembered my name.

Bed linen is also very new.- Overall cleanliness is also good.- Staffs are friendly and hospitable.- Rooftop bar is quite nice with good vibes.- Full facilities in room are setup well.- Swimming pool is nice and big.- Breakfast is satisfying.- Lobby area is beautiful decorated.- There are various choices of cake which look so tasty.- Hotel is located in a walkable range to the train stations or department stores.Cons.- Unfortunately, the hotel just opened and encounters pandemic situation. So, some facilities look not fully function.- Except the headboard in guestroom which is beautiful, overall design of room is too simple. (personally)- There is a bad smell from the drain from toilet in many areas of the hotel e.g. in guest room, lobby restroom.- Breakfast choices are limited.- As the bed linen is very new, the blanket is not so soft and fluffy yet. - Even though the room facing BTS Asoke offers a good city view, on the contrary, room on BTS Promphong side doesn't not offer quite beautiful view.- There is a bit confusion to connect from car park to lobby since the sign is not so clear.**Special thanks to K.Phan (Concierge) for his assistance on our several luggages and stuff although we came to check in at very late night.**",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

25,5.0,"Great stay with some teething issues but still a great hotel. These are purely comments which i hope will help as i experienced. Arrival: Arrived in a limousine from The Peninsula and had to wait for over 5 minutes as the car infront was trying to Valet and blocking the entrance but the driver was in a full flow conversation with the bell boy who didnt even acknowledge our car trying to arrive.  Eventually a small wave.  Bell Boys and Management ALWAYS very friendly when entering or leaving the hotel during my stay. Reception great welcome and very friendly. I had two consecutive bookings to make things more complicated. Great explanation of the hotel facilities too. Lovely. Bedroom fabulously looking but there is NO plug socket for a hairdryer near to a mirror. Had to use the socket under the TV but no mirror. Bathroom only have shaver sockets. TV channels are limited but i guess these will improve when the international market returns (comparing to other 5* in Bangkok)Restaurants not fully operational which is perfectly acceptable especially during this time.  Had dinner at Tuxedo where you could enjoy the all day dining restaurant menus too:1. Arrived and sat just behind the pillar and was IGNORED for over 10 minutes. One guy inside the window kitchen wearing black (and just chatting to the kitchen staff who were busy cleaning surfaces) was trying to get the attention of a restaurant staff but no joy.  I stood up to leave and finally a waiter came over and put down the menus. He spoke virtually NO english at all (similar to the waiter at the poolside again in black how could only point to the menus). 2. Gave my order of a starter and main course. Ended up pointing to the dishes as he could not understand. 3. Order came 15 minutes later but both starter and main course ALL together and water bottle arrived at the same time!4. The main course was WRONG.  The waiter didnt understand and a lady (excellent English speaker) who was very friendly came over showed me the menu and i  pointed to the two dishes i had ordered. She apologised and was VERY professional. She came back with an orange cake and 'very sorry'. So i had had my started by this time and then had the cake.5. Finished and asked for the bill, the CORRECT main course then arrived!!  Both dishes were very good and well presented.Cooling Tower:1. WOW!! Top class. 2. Fabulous - so fabulous that could not get a table on the first night. (hence me having dinner at Tuxedo)3. Second night had dinner there. Planned to be there one hour but ended up staying until the DJ Blackie finished! A bottle or more of wine and a few dishes  later...4. Fabulous mixes with a fabulous blend of golden oldies and up to date music and great tempo. Great vibes.5. Tangmo and Max - a credit to your team. The two hostesses extremely elegant and very well spoken and a delight! Overall the hotel is fabulous; the price we paid was excellent but competition is tough in Bangkok so it will be interesting to see the future prices once (we hope) covid is a thing of the past.Will be back (if you will let me!) during these coming months.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

Service 5/5Rooms 5/5Location 5/5We came straight from the hospital and unknowingly made a good decision choosing this hotel, Had to wait for stitches to come off before going home.Hotel is great, everything is fantastic. Whether it is the reception or clean rooms or house keeping, they are all extremely caring and welcoming. What made us surprise was that everyone in the hotel knew we came from the hospital and were really nice. Room service asked us if we needed to avoid or order specific food in our case. The housekeeping took time to clean our room thoroughly. Khun Lek in the house keeping is very prompt and quick. She has the potential to work twice as others and very quick. The day she comes, we know room cleaning would only take minutes. Even the pool section offered us juices in happy hour which usually you don't. Also Croissant on the ground floor restaurant is too good. We had the chance to meet the lady cheff and say Thank You.They even celebrated our anniversary and Birthday with Beautiful flowers and a hand written card from everyone. Very touching. We love everyone from the bell boy to the housekeeping.Our Dear Khun Pepe, Thank you for arranging those beautiful flowers. This whole year has been affected by covid and what you did for us has been the most memorable moment this year. We enjoyed talking to you everyday until someone had to come and steal you away Dear Khun Palm, You are a lovely person. Very polite and humble. It is an honour to actually meet someone so simple yet intelligent in today. It is rare to find people like you. We wish you and your family all the best and may we always see you smiling. By the way i got the hanger and the wire back that i borrowed and informed you  Thank youWe also want to Thank Khun Amm, Khun Yu, Khun Nhing, Khun Esther, Khun Title, Khun Benz, Khun New, Thank you to you all too for being there for us. We will be back on New Year's Eve to celebrate with you all, until then we will miss you.God Bless You all & a Happy 2021Room 2114P.s. our all time favourite hotel is The Leela Ambiance India.

The dim sum at Wah Lok are simply delicious, as good as the one in Singapore if not better!I love chilling out at the Cooling Tower roof top bar. A well design comfortable roof top bar with a stunning view at night. The staffs were super friendly and helpful. Fantastic service and attitude!I also enjoyed the Tuxedo café at the lobby. It has a nice and casual ambiance. A good place to relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning….One thing that set the hotel apart is the ever helpful and attentive staffs…. Wanted to give a shout out to Yu at the front desk for her warm welcome and attentiveness. A big thank you to the F&B manager and Nooni for arranging a nice steak dinner at the Cooling Tower when I told them that I craved for steak. It was wonderful to enjoy my steak while looking down at the lights and the view beneath….2 thumbs up!The team at the Carlton are doing a fantastic job!

We didn't get much of a chance to try the food - due to COVID parts of the dining areas were closed. Breakfast is ala carte for now (presumably not in the future?) and solid, as was the room service menu. Speaking of service, all staff from the porters to the concierge, cleaners to guest service were amazing. Definitely the reason we stayed twice, and definitely the reason we'll stay again.

Absolutely beautiful interior, spotlessly clean, incredible attention to detail, kind and caring staff (who literally couldn't do enough for you) and the best of all.........THE BEST VIEWS OF BANGKOK from our bedroom!We decided to stay at this hotel because the price was so cheap for the rating of this hotel on trip advisor! It was such a treat, as I imagine when covid restrictions are lifted, this hotel will be inundated with tourism and double the price!This hotel is  MUST if you are wanting a luxurious experience, where you truly feel pampered from the moment you enter, to the moment you leave. The location is perfect, just a 5 min walk from the ASOK BTS line, a short walk to Emporium mall and a short BTS line to all the other malls (such as Central World and Siam).In the reception, it also has a sterilising box, to sterilise your belongings if you wish!

I was looking for a clean, well appointed hotel where I could recover in a safe, quiet place.I consider house keeping and maintenance sections to be the backbone of a hotel.  Housekeeping provided the little extras (water, tea bags) that I requested.  The one maintenance problem (need to reset the A C fuse) was dealt with within 5 minutes).The pool is long (20 to 25 meters) and clean.  The fitness center is is well equipped, with equipment not commonly found.The meals are good.  I had room service, a sandwich at the Tuxedo Cafe, and dim sun at the Chinese restaurant.Khun Title is the Concierge.  It was a pleasure to have the benefit of his knowledge.All of the Front Desk staff behaved with equal professional competence.

They all seemed to remember me each time I'd pop in and out despite the countless faces they must see walking through every day.Bedrooms are very clean, showers hot, television channels excellent and the fitness centre is second to none for a hotel.The location is great too, only locate about a 5 minute walk to Asok BTS. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone - business and family trips alike. I look forward to my return",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0
51,5.0,"To the point, we very much enjoyed our staycation here. The new hotel and their exceptional staff deserve a five star recommendation. From our well designed/functional hotel room to their multiple restaurant dining venues (we dined at three of them) including Wah Lok (marvelous dimsum), the rooftop Cooling Tower, and the Plate (for a lovely breakfast), we give them ALL and their staff a thumbs up. We loved the live DJ vibes at the rooftop bar.  The workout room is large and well equipped. The very large/long salt-water pool is exceptional. But foremost, as prior reviewers have shared, what stood out most were the earnest service providers from time of arrival to time of departure and at each of the dining venues (including the pool staff too). There were management/staff introductions on arrival, follow-ups during our stay, and again kind follow-ups on our departure (not just to see how we were doing but also to solicit any feedback on improvements).  We can't let this review end without sharing our recognition and hats off to Khun Palm, Khun Boram, Khun Esther, Khun Jenny and Khun Dy ... and to a very endearing bespetacled young man at the pool who so enthusiastically shared helpful insights on the available pool services.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0
52,5.0,"We have stayed in a lot of hotels, but the Carlton is without doubt the best we have ever stayed in. We opted for a Club access room for a 5 night stay and were not disappointed. Right from arrival on check in the staff were superb - they went above and beyond to help with whatever we needed. The room was spotless with nice touches like automatic curtains over our big panoramic window, a Japanese style toilet and Nespresso machine. The bed was very comfortable with very high quality linen and the internet was lightening fast.Only a couple of criticisms from us - the air con was so cold, even set at 26 degrees (we live in Thailand), we were freezing and had to have it turned off most of the time! There wasn't a socket in the bathroom for hair dryers (only for shavers which normal plugs don't fit into) so makes it difficult for ladies to do their hair as there's no other sockets near to a mirror. The universal sockets next to the bed were very stiff, perhaps because they were new, but our 3 pin UK plugs didn't fully fit into them. These are minor criticisms thought, it's an outstanding hotelThe swimming pool is fabulous and huge, the best we have seen in Bangkok. Excellent happy hour and very attentive staff. The gym (although we didn't use it) is very well equipped. Plate restaurant with the set menu lunch was really good value and the food was excellent - we ate here twice. We went to the Cooling Tower rooftop bar and the views and sunset were stunning, along with brilliant staff and the cocktails were amazing.

One area they should look at its getting rid of the plastic water bottles in the rooms and have glass bottles. Also remove the plastic bottles in the showers and baths.Or have refill stations for water.

74,5.0,"We stayed at the Carlton Hotel Bangkok for the 3rd time now. I actually asked my 3-year-old son where he wanted to go for the weekend. Usually, he likes trying new places, but this time he was very determined to go back to the Carlton Hotel.  This doesn't come to a surprise as the staff is great with kids. Especially Mrs Whan at the desk and Khun Win at the Tuxedo Restaurant. Those 2 really manage to be professional and are great with or son. They seem to understand that kids aren't just kids, but they want to be included in all experiences. They make our son feel welcome and feel included as a guest. We had the afternoon delight tea for lunch and were amazed by how delicious every component was. We usually don't eat sweets as we live a keto lifestyle, but we thought we'd give it a try and just taste everything. We ate the whole thing like savages :D it was extremely delicious. Those chefs really really know what they are doing.I also have to give special credits to Yu, Ester, Nhing, and again Whan as a team, as they noticed it was my birthday. They called us to invite us to the rooftop bar for a complimentary birthday drink. We were actually planning to eat out, but as that sounded very inviting we went up for drinks. The rooftop bar was so nice, we decided to stay for dinner and thank god we did! The food was amazing! We all slept like babies in the super comfortable beds. The rooms are designed more convenient than most hotel rooms in Thailand. They've put some thought in efficiency and practicality. The blinds block out all the light and close with a switch instead of manually. No more putting all the pillows you can find in the room to block out the light :) The only thing I'm missing is a plug near a mirror to blowdry and style my hair. That's probably the only thing they missed designing the rooms. Also, a small bin in the bathroom would be more convenient.  But other than those small details it's designed to perfection. The pool is very nice. I love the woodwork they used and the sunbeds are comfortable. The pool bar is great and again, the food is so good!!! There are too many 5 hotels with terrible kitchens. I'm happy that Carton Hotel realizes how important a good inhouse restaurant is! I could probably write a book about all the things I love about the hotel but short summary the pool, the restaurant, the facilities and above all the staff! The staff can make or break your experience and I think the staff of Carlton is well aware of that. Please keep up the good job and we will definitely come back often and be your best advocates.",Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,5.0

The bed itself was faultless.Every staff member I interacted with was pleasant, accommodating and smiling. In particular Namwhan, Yu and Esther all left an excellent lasting impression. I really felt like a VIP during my stay. The breakfast was served unlimited but a la carte, and everything was fresh and delicious. The coffee was excellent and the bacon was amongst the best I've been served in SE Asia.The fitness suite was sparkling, clean and very well-appointed, and the pool area is pleasant too. On my first night I also spent time at the Cooling Tower, the bar and restaurant on the top floor. Naturally the views were excellent, but I was also surprised to find the food was impressive too - a light and fresh spinach focaccia washed down with on-tap IPAs, recommended by yet more helpful and attentive staff.I cannot recommend the Carlton more highly.

The receptionists were friendly, and my appreciation goes specifically to Khun Jane who took care of the check in as she was so attentive. After checking in, we went to have dinner at Tuxedo Bar.

Opened in 2020, the variety of rooms flagship promises a blend of style, serenity and comfort.And it delivers. Its magnificence is made clear from the second I enter the lobby. A sweeping & spacious floorplan; classic yet contemporary design features and, most resonant, a feeling of familial hospitality which competitors often struggle to achieve. Having arrived with city shrouded in grey, the dazzling interior design is a welcome sight, and thankfully, it’s in no short supply. As I’m escorted to my room by one of Carlton’s expertly-trained team members, I can’t help but notice that no stone has been left unturned and the attention to detail is remarkable. The use of light woods; marble tiling and high ceilings generates a refreshing airiness and palatial spaciousness. Locally crafted fabrics, furniture and art are tastefully displayed alongside modern décor and state-of-the-art appliances. No stuffiness here: a veritable feeling of ease and comfort abounds, giving the sense that these are spaces designed to be lived in and moved through.Undoubtedly one of the biggest drawcards to Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit is its extensive range of dining experiences.

Another thing is swimming pool, the hotel allow guest to use maximum 2 ppl per hour, you need to make reservation in advance.

38,4.0,"Last year I wrote a glowing review of Swissotel Bangkok and I did not feel the need to provide an update until things changed.  Unfortunately I must now report on significant cutbacks at this hotel regarding room Platinum upgrades and happy hour.  Service remains great and breakfast in the lounge is still top notch but going forward my enthusiasm is more tempered about returning.In the past I booked the Executive Suite and received a one-category upgrade to the Crest Suite as Accor Platinum.  For this stay I again booked the Exec Suite and I saw online that the vast majority of room types were available at time of check-in including the Crest Suite, therefore I was surprised to find out at the front desk that we were not getting upgraded.  Staff indicated that they no longer upgrade above the Exec Suite level.  This is disappointing and is akin to the policy we experienced at Banyan Tree Bangkok last year: if you book a suite you won’t get upgraded. In my opinion this is not competitive with other hotel chains where you can book a suite and get upgraded to a premium suite but in any event I can adjust my stay pattern accordingly.  My takeaway is that for stays where I want to book a suite outright there are better places to maximize value where they do not hesitate to upgrade to premium suites.Happy hour in the lounge has been cut back from 2.5 hours to 2 hours (6-8pm) but the most disappointing aspect is what they now offer in the lounge.  Whenever a lounge goes down from luxury appetizers such as oysters to mini-pizzas, that’s quite a fall from grace.  For this stay they also had tonkatsu and sushi but they frequently ran out and were very slow to refill.  We were only about a dozen people in the lounge so it was still quite peaceful and a pleasant environment, and remains superior to the Banyan Tree lounge.  However 12 guests in the lounge is not many – struggling to keep up with refills leaves room for improvement.Breakfast in the lounge remains a strength of this hotel and I did not observe the same cutbacks as for happy hour.  They had seafood fried rice, the cold buffet also had scallops, mussels, and shrimps – very few lounges have such offerings for breakfast.  To go along the buffet they still have an extensive a la carte menu prepared by the chef at the live cooking station; I am glad this has not been taken away.  Fruit selection is also above average: I tend to rate breakfasts higher when they have special fruits such as mangoes and Swissotel ticks the box in that regard; they were so juicy!  The lounge was very peaceful in the morning: only a handful of people were there besides us.  Given that Athenee Luxury Collection Hotel (which is one of the higher end hotels with a lounge in Bangkok) has cut sparkling wine from breakfast in their lounge recently, an argument can be made that as far as lounge breakfasts go, Swissotel is one of the best.Besides food not being replenished fast enough in the evening, service in the lounge remains superb – staff is always friendly and attentive, they recognized us from before and addressed us by name, etc.  Overall I was disappointed by the lack of room upgrade and the now subpar happy hour.  Given that the drawbacks of this property have not gone away (location, aging hardware), I must be more tempered than last time in my assessment of this hotel.  The breakfast and service will bring me back but possibly not as often as before because the recent changes are negative.",Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada Hotel,4.5

Nothing is too much trouble. From the moment we left our taxi, and were met by the doorman and his staff, we knew we had chosen the right hotel. Our 'meet and greet' team were so happy to see us and tend to our needs that we felt at home straight away. When we needed a taxi, it was there.  If we were negotiating the road outside, a 'traffic' officer escorted us to safety.  Unbelievable. The check-in staff were efficient and friendly and the staff at the International Buffet and A-la-cart were fantastic. We dined there most days and found everyone from the Food and Beverage Manager, to the Head Chef, Soux Chef and the Floor Manager and her staff, especially 'Sarah' were amazing.

61,1.0,"The Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada must have been a very glamorous hotel in its heyday. It has amenities that back in the 90s must have very much impressed its guests: a centralized control for lighting, air conditioning, and radio; a 'Please wait' button next to the toilet to politely ask visitors for patience in case you were thus engaged; and a hi-fi sound system complete with CD and tape players. The vintage feel, however, extends to the rest of the facilities - carpets and upholstery are tired and stained, the in-room air conditioning is noisy with an ineffective thermostat (freezing when on, sweltering when off, neither bearing any link with the temperature setting), and like the rings of a tree-trunk, you can probably date the fixtures through the layers of crusted dust. The kindness of the staff, low price-point for the hotel category, and the location for some meetings, makes up for it. What I couldn't really get over was finding a (dead) bug pressed between my bedsheets on my first night, which means that this went through a washer, dryer, and ironing process without the bug being found. More disturbing, though, was finding a reasonably large nail fragment under the edge of my bed when checking nothing rolled under it upon check-out.This is probably a one-off experience, but I will avoid this hotel in the future if I can.

Additionally, TRUST ME and get a Traditional Thai massage while you are there.  It was the best massage I've ever gotten and the price was great.  I got it on our last night and tried to schedule another one for the morning before I left, but they were booked up.  Honestly, I am tempted to go back to Thailand just for a massage at this hotel.  The restaurant Suan Bua at the hotel was really subpar.  We were the first people there when it opened, and it still took us over 2 hours to eat and get our check.  We asked for our check and a dessert to go simultaneously, and it took 30 minutes (we timed it) to get both.  We were falling asleep at the table and so ready to go back to our room!The pool is beautiful but the hot tub was broken.  We were excited to go sit in the hot tub after a long day, but it was cold when we got down there!We went up to the rooftop restaurant (which is a French bistro), but it wasn't anything special so we didn't eat up there.

I had 2 separate bookings and requested to maintain in the same room. I understand it is subjected to availability but the way Hsiao-Min rejected me without even checking. This frustrates me. She even squinted at Kotchaporn with an irritated and agitated look. Is this the kind of service you put at the front desk to represent your Hotel? More importantly, is this the kind of hospitality Thailand offers? The land of smiles?

I showed the staff my destination clearly on a google map. But the taxi driver tried to take me to a different place farther away.

50,5.0,Stayed here with my wife as part of a four centre trip to Thailand. Primary reason for visit was a friend’s traditional Thai wedding in Bangkok and chose this hotel for its proximity to the wedding venue. Can not fault the hotel facilities or the staff who were always friendly and helpful. Not necessarily convenient for the major tourist attractions and worth bearing in mind that for large parts of the day the traffic will double the time for most taxi journeys. Use the Grab app and book a car rather than a taxi as it is fixed price. Breakfast is amazing. Also ate at the international buffet one evening with the choice being superb and catering for all tastes. Hotel is attached to the huge central plaza shopping centre with lots of food choices. For me another plus was the close proximity of two parks for running in. Recommended ,Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok Hotel,4.5

My only complaint with this hotel is the lifts, the lifts worked fine, BUT every time one of the lifts was called / arrived it let off a loud ""bing bong"" noise to announce its arrival. Not a problem during the day but all through the night intensely annoying. Bearing in mind that this hotel is used as an airport hotel, including cabin crew staying here, there are guests coming and going through the day and night. Management really need to go and spend some time sitting in a room near to the lifts and see how frequent and loud that ""bing bong"" is, why does it need to be that loud? Why cant it be silenced through the night?

Of particular note was the extra effort made by the front door staff to hail a taxi for me early in the early morning of my departure - that is they actually went out of the hotel grounds and down to the main road to flag a driver down.  I do agree with other contributors that the actual hotel is a bit dated and could do with a renovation but this is completely out of the control of the staff and I would certainly return here in the future.",Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok Hotel,4.5
83,1.0,"The hotel reservation service is very bad. If you send mail to book the hotel, you need to send same mail over 5 times. For the pick up limousine service, you need to send mail 10 times, and you can get the confirmation letter. The hotel is one of the worst experience for me.",Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok Hotel,4.5

88,4.0,Stayed at the Centara Grand while on a business trip to Bangkok.  Experienced true Thai Hospitality at the hotel with friendly and courteous staff. The hotel is linked to the BTS and Subway Station through a shopping center and the location is great. Almost anything you need is a stones throw away including the famous chatuchak weekend market.
